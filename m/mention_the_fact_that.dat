Enjoying the benefit of a second Emily at first, the real Emily comes across problems such as identity crisis and loss of some of her unique talents. Not to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> her clone thinks she's the real Emily and evidently plans to end Emily Strange for good.|$|E
500|$|Bronstein {{felt that}} Fischer [...] "had {{the right to}} play the match with Karpov on his own conditions". Korchnoi stated:Was Fischer right in {{demanding}} that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10–8 score and that the champion would retain his title {{in the event of}} a 9–9 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> further play to the first win {{in the event of a}}n even score would be nothing short of a lottery – the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.|$|E
2500|$|Yael Kahn, {{chair of}} the UK-based Islington Friends of Yibna said that while she pleased to see openly {{criticism}} of Israeli policies, she {{also found that the}} petition was [...] "wholly inappropriate, due to its failure to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these settlements are illegal. I am utterly appalled by the failure of the petition to mention Gaza and the barbaric siege Israel imposes on the 1.5 million Palestinians living there. It is outrageous to not speak out against the Israeli restrictions on the amount of food Palestinians in Gaza are allowed to have." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shaun Williamson {{frequently}} plays {{himself in}} Ricky Gervais's Extras, {{where he is}} referred to at all times as [...] "Barry from EastEnders". Derek Martin (Charlie Slater) appeared in episode three in the third series of Little Britain in 2005. The sketch primarily focused around the character Marjorie Dawes telling her Fat Fighters group not to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Martin is in EastEnders, then mentioning it herself. In the Comic Relief special of Little Britain, the character Dennis Waterman refers to his [...] "daughter - the one in EastEnders". This is {{a reference to the}} real actor Dennis Waterman, who is the father of Hannah Waterman, who played Laura Beale in the show.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to get much more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907 Alfred Richardson {{received}} an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: [...] "Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward. JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and we walked into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E
