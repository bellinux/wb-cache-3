50|$|The initial {{evidence}} {{cited by}} the creators of the irRC that their criteria were useful lay in the two Phase II melanoma trials described in the Clinical Cancer Research paper. The drug being trialled was a monoclonal antibody called ipilimumab, then under development at BMS with Axel Hoos as the <b>medical</b> <b>lead.</b> The drug targeted an immune checkpoint called CTLA-4, known as a key negative regulator of T cell activity. By blocking CTLA-4, ipilimumab was designed to potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. In the Phase IIs, which encompassed 227 treated patients and evaluated patients using the irRC, around 10% of these patients would have been deemed to have Progressive Disease by the WHO Criteria but actually experienced irPRs or irSDs, consistent with a response to ipilimumab.|$|E

40|$|Internationally, {{a typical}} model of {{maternity}} {{care is a}} medically led system with varying levels of midwifery input. New Zealand has a midwife-led model of care, and there are movements in other countries to adopt such a system. There is a paucity of systemic evaluation that formally investigates safety-related outcomes in relationship to midwife-led care within an entire maternity service. The main objective {{of this study was}} to compare major adverse perinatal outcomes between midwife-led and medical-led maternity care in New Zealand. This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. Participants were mother/baby pairs for all 244, 047 singleton, term deliveries occurring between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 in New Zealand in which no major fetal, neonatal, chromosomal or metabolic abnormality was identified and the mother was first registered with a midwife, obstetrician, or general practitioner as lead maternity carer. Main outcome measures were low Apgar score at five min, intrauterine hypoxia, birth-related asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy, small for gestational age (as a negative control), and mortality outcomes (perinatal related mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality). Logistic regression models were fitted, with crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) generated for each outcome for midwife-led versus medical-led care (based on lead maternity carer at first registration) with 95 % confidence intervals. Fully adjusted models included age, ethnicity, deprivation, trimester of registration, parity, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and pre-existing diabetes and/or hypertension in the model. Of the 244, 047 pregnancies included in the study, 223, 385 (91. 5 %) were first registered with a midwife lead maternity carer, and 20, 662 (8. 5 %) with a <b>medical</b> <b>lead</b> maternity carer. Adjusted ORs showed that medical-led births were associated with lower odds of an Apgar score of less than seven at 5 min (OR 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval 0. 43 - 0. 64), intrauterine hypoxia (OR 0. 79; 0. 62 - 1. 02), birth-related asphyxia (OR 0. 45; 0. 32 - 0. 62), and neonatal encephalopathy (OR 0. 61; 0. 38 - 0. 97). No association was found between lead carer at first registration and being small for gestational age (SGA), which was included as a negative control (OR 1. 00; 0. 95 - 1. 05). It was not possible to definitively determine whether one model of care was associated with fewer infant deaths, with ORs for the medical-led model compared with the midwife-led model being 0. 80 (0. 54 - 1. 19) for perinatal related mortality, 0. 86 (0. 55 - 1. 34) for stillbirth, and 0. 62 (0. 25 - 1. 53) for neonatal mortality. Major limitations were related to the use of routine data in which some variables lacked detail; for example, we were unable to differentiate the midwife-led group into those who had received medical input during pregnancy and those who had not. There is an unexplained excess of adverse events in midwife-led deliveries in New Zealand where midwives practice autonomously. The findings are of concern and demonstrate a need for further research that specifically investigates the reasons for the apparent excess of adverse outcomes in mothers with midwife-led care. These findings should be interpreted in the context of New Zealand's internationally comparable birth outcomes and in the context of research that supports the many benefits of midwife-led care, such as greater patient satisfaction and lower intervention rates...|$|E

40|$|The RF {{field in}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) induces {{currents}} {{in the human}} body, and the principal bioeffect is tissue heating. The presence of an electrically conducting medical implant will concentrate the RF-induced currents that may cause additional and possibly dangerous tissue heating. For this reason, metallic implants are {{generally considered to be}} contraindicated for MR imaging. However, patients with metallic implants often need further examinations using MR procedures. ^ In this work, MRI-induced heating of medical implants was evaluated by in vitro measurements and numerical computations. As a specific example of a medical device, a Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system was investigated for MRI-induced heating. Novel concepts of transfer functions and current density imaging were developed to analyze the dependence of heating on the incident field distribution and to quantify the induced current distributions on metallic wires that simulated <b>medical</b> <b>leads.</b> ^ The impact of concentration of the gelling agent in a saline-based phantom on the MRI-induced temperature rise was measured using a DBS system. It was determined that an appropriate gelling agent is required to avoid convection in order to accurately simulate the thermal properties of body tissues for measurements of RF-induced heating with medical implants. ^ Numerical methods based on integral equations to analyze the interaction between the RF-induced electric field with bare and insulated wires were developed. The reaction integral equation (RIE) was used for straight wires and the electric field integral equation (EFIE) for curved wires. Currents induced on the wire were calculated using Galerkin 2 ̆ 7 s method of moments. The electric field in the tissue surrounding the wire was calculated from the induced currents to determine the power deposition. From the power deposition, the temperature rise was calculated using the bioheat equation. The method was applied to a practical DBS lead and there was good agreement between measurements and calculations. ^ A transfer function between the incident electric field and the scattered field at the electrode was developed to investigate in detail how the incident field contributes to the heating of implanted <b>medical</b> <b>leads.</b> ...|$|R
