25|$|Innovation in milking {{focused on}} mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as a <b>milking</b> <b>shed)</b> to {{maximize}} the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked as if on an assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting the cows on a platform slightly above the person milking the cows to eliminate having to constantly bend over. Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.|$|E

The roof tiles are red, and the balconies have iron railings. The exterior design is plain struck brickwork, reassured by red bricks and cut stone. The entrance block is located on the westerly end of the front. Because of a sudden fall in the land, the pavement is several feet above the natural surface which necessitated a flight of stone steps towards the entrance. The main doors to the building have two windows alongside them and form a porch.

500|$|The orphanage {{was run by}} the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church {{until its}} closure in 1978. Shortly after opening, the orphanage {{experienced}} an increased demand for admission leading {{to the construction of}} a west wing and chapel in 1919. However, it remained unfurnished for some time due to lack of funding, and the Sisters of Mercy subsequently refused admission. A new wing for the building was constructed in 1924 dedicated to the memory of Bishop Gallagher. The new wing was opened and blessed by Reverend J. Barry; additional classrooms and dormitories were built, being [...] by [...] in size, followed by furnishing, painting and connection of sewer lines. The total cost was approximately £2,676. In 1932, a <b>milking</b> <b>shed</b> and hall were built, and in 1938 new additions to the orphanage were added, costing £2,575. This included a modification and extension to the south wing. The orphanage endured minor damage in 1943 when a fire broke out just after midnight and destroyed quantities of firewood and two panels of fencing.|$|E

60|$|Thus it {{was really}} the public and not the medical {{profession}} that took up vaccination with irresistible faith, sweeping the invention out of Jenner's hand and establishing it in a form which he himself repudiated. Jenner was not a man of science; but he was not a fool; and when he found that people who had suffered from cowpox either by contagion in the <b>milking</b> <b>shed</b> or by vaccination, were not, as he had supposed, immune from smallpox, he ascribed the cases of immunity which had formerly misled him to a disease of the horse, which, perhaps because we do not drink its milk and eat its flesh, is kept at a greater distance in our imagination than our foster mother the cow. At all events, the public, which had been boundlessly credulous about the cow, would not have the horse on any terms; and to this day the law which prescribes Jennerian vaccination is carried out with an anti-Jennerian inoculation because the public would have it so in spite of Jenner. All the grossest lies and superstitions which have disgraced the vaccination craze were taught to the doctors by the public. It was not the doctors who first began to declare that all our old men remember the time when almost every face they saw in the street was horribly pitted with smallpox, and that all this disfigurement has vanished since the introduction of vaccination. Jenner himself alluded to this imaginary phenomenon before the introduction of vaccination, and attributed it to the older practice of smallpox inoculation, by which Voltaire, Catherine II. and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu so confidently expected to see the disease made harmless. It was not Jenner who set people declaring that smallpox, if not abolished by vaccination, had at least been made much milder: on the contrary, he recorded a pre-vaccination epidemic in which none of the persons attacked went to bed or considered themselves as seriously ill. Neither Jenner, nor any other doctor ever, as far as I know, inculcated the popular notion that everybody got smallpox {{as a matter of course}} before vaccination was invented. That doctors get infected with these delusions, and are in their unprofessional capacity as members of the public subject to them like other men, is true; but if we had to decide whether vaccination was first forced on the public by the doctors or on the doctors by the public, we should have to decide against the public.|$|E

5000|$|The Hiram C. Smith <b>Milking</b> <b>Shed</b> is a {{historic}} building located west of Winterset, Iowa, United States. Smith {{was one of the}} earliest settlers in this township, having acquired the deed to the 280 acre farm between 1854 and 1856. This building is an early example of a vernacular limestone farm building. It is a single-story, gabled structure composed of rubble stone that was quarried along the Middle River on the farm and laid in a random bond. Its construction is attributed to Smith, as its rough and simple construction do not reflect the work of any of the stonemasons working in the county {{at the time it was}} built.

5000|$|The north {{tip of the}} peninsula, {{which was}} {{originally}} called East Head by the early settlers, was a dairy farm called Westend. The <b>milking</b> <b>shed</b> for Westend was at the lower or south end of Musick Pt Road on an area of flat land adjacent to a small creek about 50 metres from the beach. The cottage on this property (near the water tower) had fallen into decay by the 1930s and was uninhabitable -it was known to the locals as the [...] "rats nest". At {{the south end of}} the peninsula were 2 farms the one on the eastern side, roughly on the same land as Macleans College, was run by the Trusdale family.

40|$|Aflatoxins are a {{group of}} toxic {{metabolites}} produced by Aspergillus molds that contaminate a variety of food and animal feeds. Exposure to aflatoxins causes serious illness in humans, including liver cancer and stunting in children. When cows ingest aflatoxin-contaminated feed, they secrete aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) in their milk. Aflatoxin M 1 has been detected in high concentration throughout sub-Saharan Africa in cow’s milk and in human breast milk, putting infants at high risk. In Ethiopia, a currently ongoing study has revealed high levels of contamination of dairy feeds with aflatoxins in the Greater Addis <b>milk</b> <b>shed.</b> In this study, we have collected raw milk samples from dairy farmers and milk collectors in the Greater Addis <b>milk</b> <b>shed</b> and quantified the levels of AFM 1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Using a cross-sectional study design, a total of 100 raw milk samples were collected from dairy farms in Addis Ababa and its surrounding areas (27 from Addis Ababa, 23 from Debre Zeit, 9 from Sebeta, 31 from Sendafa and 10 from Sululta). All the milk samples were contaminated with AFM 1 and most (92 %) of the samples had aflatoxin levels exceeding 50 ppt, which is the FAO/WHO and EU permissible level of AFM 1 in milk. The highest AFM 1 content was 4977 ppt and the lowest was 28 ppt. In addition, ten raw milk samples were collected from milk collectors located in Addis Ababa (1), Debre Zeit (3) and Sululta (6). All of the samples from milk collectors were contaminated with AFM 1 exceeding 50 ppt. The high levels of AFM 1 in milk in the Greater Addis <b>milk</b> <b>shed</b> is alarming, because {{it is one of}} the largest <b>milk</b> <b>sheds</b> in the country, and most residents of Addis Ababa get their milk from these sources. Children in particular are encouraged to drink milk as much as possible. Considering that young children are weaned on to cow's milk and they are not immune-competent at this early age, consumption of milk contaminated with AFM 1 may further suppress their immunity and also contribute to stunting. In addition, it has been estimated that aflatoxins may play a causative role in up to 30 % of the cases of liver cancer globally each year. Therefore, the high level of aflatoxin contamination in the peri-urban dairy value chain of Addis Ababa requires urgent response to reduce human and animal exposure to these toxins. Our research group is currently testing intervention strategies to address the problem of aflatoxins in dairy feed in Ethiopia...|$|R
