50|$|Disadvantages of <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> include lower efficiency, {{generally}} between 83% (lightly loaded machine) and 92% (fully loaded machine). In comparison, cycloconverter efficiency can exceed 95%. Also, <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> {{require more}} routine maintenance due their nature as rotating machines, given the bearings and slip rings. Today, the outright replacement of <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> {{would also be}} difficult due to the high manufacturing cost and limited demand for these large 25 Hz machines.|$|R

50|$|Early {{last century}} the {{principles}} were explored {{as a means}} to melt steel, and the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> was developed to provide the power required for the induction furnace. After general acceptance of the methodology for melting steel, engineers began to explore other possibilities for the utilisation of the process. It was already understood that the depth of current penetration in steel was a function of its magnetic permeability, resistivity and the frequency of the applied field. Engineers at Midvale Steel and The Ohio Crankshaft Company drew on this knowledge to develop the first surface hardening induction heating systems using <b>motor</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Motor-{{generators}} {{and steam}} turbine generators were the original power sources on the PRR traction power network. The last steam turbine {{shut down in}} 1954, {{but some of the}} original <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> remain. Although the converting machines are frequently called 'rotary converters' or 'rotary frequency converters', they are not the rotary converter used frequently by subways to convert low-frequency alternating current to DC power. The converters used are more precisely described as <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> and consist of two synchronous AC machines on a common shaft with different ratios of poles; they are not electrically connected as in a true rotary converter.|$|R

40|$|Brookhaven {{operates}} a 9 MW <b>motor</b> <b>generator,</b> made by Siemens, {{as part of}} the main magnet power supply of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) accelerator. A cycloconverter power supply system is utilized to ensure that during pulsing the main magnets of the AGS up to 50 MW peak power, the input power of the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> remains constant. There is also another <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> (MG set) at Brookkhaven, a 40 year old system manufactured by Westinghouse. This MG set could be pulsed up to 34 MW peak power while the input average power should not exceed. 4. 1 MW. A project is underway to upgrade this MG system and it’s controls, so it {{could be used as a}} spare while doing maintenance on the Siemens MG and thus not interrupting the RHIC physics program. The purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to pulse the AGS magnets using the Westinghouse MG system without utilizing a cycloconverter power supply, and still be able to maintain the input power to the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> constant. Calculations will be provided to show that we can pulse the position of the liquid rheostat in the motor rotor circuit to support the above, while taking out the power necessary to pulse the AGS magnets. This solution is being implemented due to budget constraints and overall simplicity. The hydraulic system to accomplish this task will also be described...|$|R
50|$|The engines, now {{referred}} to as power units, are divided into 6 components: {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE); turbocharger (TC); <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), which harvests energy that would normally be wasted under braking; <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Heat (MGU-H), which collects energy in the form of heat as it is expelled through the exhaust; Energy Store (ES), which functions as batteries, holding the energy gathered by the <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Units; and Control Electronics (CE), which includes the Electronic Control Unit and software used to manage the entire power unit. In 2015, each driver is allowed to use up to four of each component during a season that is up to 20 scheduled races in length; a fifth power unit (and its components) may be used without penalty if more than 20 races are scheduled to take place. A ten place starting grid penalty will be applied for the use of a power unit component used beyond the established allocation; a pit lane start for entire unit changes beyond the limit.|$|R
