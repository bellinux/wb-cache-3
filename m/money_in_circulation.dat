5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{reduction}} in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under HenryII, only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers, and the tightening of controls continued throughout the 13th century. By the reign of EdwardI there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins. The amount of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there had been around £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1million. At any particular point in time, though, much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments, resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy. One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.|$|E

5|$|On taking power Henry gave a high {{priority}} to the restoration of royal finances in England, reviving Henry I's financial processes and attempting {{to improve the quality}} of the royal accounting. Revenue from the demesne formed the bulk of Henry's income in England, although taxes were used heavily in the first 11 years of his reign. Aided by the capable Richard FitzNeal, Henry reformed the currency in 1158, putting his name on English coins for the first time and heavily reducing the number of moneyers licensed to produce coins. These measures were successful in improving his income, but on his return to England in the 1160s Henry took further steps. New taxes were introduced and the existing accounts re-audited, and the reforms of the legal system brought in new streams of money from fines and amercements. A wholesale reform of the coinage occurred in 1180, with royal officials taking direct control of the mints and passing the profits directly to the treasury. A new penny, called the Short Cross, was introduced, and the number of mints reduced substantially to ten across the country. Driven by the reforms, the royal revenues increased significantly; during the first part of the reign, Henry's average exchequer income was only around £18,000; after 1166, the average was around £22,000. One economic effect of these changes was a substantial increase in the amount of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> in England and, post-1180, a significant, long-term increase in both inflation and trade.|$|E

40|$|The Russian {{economy has}} evolved into a hybrid form, a {{partially}} monetized quasi-market system that has been called the virtual economy. In the virtual economy, barter and non-monetary transactions {{play a key role in}} transferring value from productive activities to the natural monopolies and loss-making sectors of the economy. The project aims at providing a consistent and multi-facet exposition of main features of the Russian virtual economy, and explains why it is different from other transition economies. In particular, the endogenous appearance of money substitutes and wide-spread use of non-monetary transactions are explained as a result of the optimizing behavior of agents in the economy, given the inherited distorted structure, the existence of large natural monopolies, the unproductive sector organized into informal networks, and the government policies aimed at the support of this sector. We highlight the typical distortions of the price system, and provide an explanation of the observed dynamics of the volume of <b>money</b> substitutes <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> after August 1998 crisis. We show that the Russian virtual economy can be in one of two steady states with approximately the same price systems but essentially different volumes of <b>money</b> substitutes <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> Transition into the state with the smaller volume of <b>money</b> substitutes <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> can be caused by an increase of the number of active producers resulting from some external shock. We conjecture that should the productive business activity be suppressed, then the economy can swiftly return to the former state with the large volume of <b>money</b> substitutes <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> Russia, <b>money</b> substitutes, search models...|$|R

25|$|With the {{restoration}} of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by {{the construction of the}} Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories {{on the north side of}} the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I Komnenos's reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people. In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews. In 1182, all Latin (Western European) inhabitants of Constantinople were massacred.|$|E

25|$|Persian Gulf issues: For {{many years}} in the early and mid-20th century, the Indian rupee was the {{official}} currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India: areas such as East Africa, Southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The rupees used in the Persian Gulf had been bought by the Gulf states from the Reserve Bank of India, who held the sterling reserves by which the rupees had originally been purchased. However, Indian rupees were being smuggled from India to the states of the Persian Gulf in exchange for gold. It was estimated in 1959 that the total amount of gold in private hands in India was about $US1.75 to 2 billion– roughly two-thirds of the value of paper <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> While it was legal to own and to trade in gold within India, it was illegal to import or export gold. The Gulf Rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf Rupee (PGR), was introduced by the Indian government as a replacement for the Indian Rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act, 1 May 1959. After India devalued the rupee on June 1966, those countries still using it – Oman, Qatar and what is now the United Arab Emirates (known as the Trucial States until 1971)– replaced the Gulf Rupee with their own currencies. Kuwait and Bahrain had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Lacking a {{gold reserve}} {{to back up}} the Republican banknotes, and already {{suffering}} from significant devaluation, the Government of the Republic began to issue increasing quantities of banknotes with no backing in gold or silver, thereby increasing the overall paper <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> By April 30, 1938, the number of new banknotes in circulation in Republican-controlled areas was calculated to be 12,754 million pesetas, an increment of 265.8% with respect to the 3,486 million of July 17, 1936; by then 2,650 million were in circulation in the Nationalist-controlled territory, in contrast to the approximately 2,000 million of July 1936. These actions caused massive inflation, and led to the amassment of precious metals by the population. While prices increased by 40% in the Nationalist areas, they skyrocketed by up to 1500% in the Republican-controlled areas. Metallic coins began to disappear and were replaced by paper or cardboard circles. Transactions with Republican banknotes became undesirable, as such notes were already highly devalued, and it was further known that, if Franco were to win the War, those banknotes would lose their full value, since they were all newly-issued series placed in circulation {{from the start of the}} War (June 1936) onwards. The State was unable to effectively respond to the lack of metallic currency, causing town halls and other local institutions to print their own provisional bonds, some of which were rejected in neighbouring municipalities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1766, three events {{occurred}} which profoundly influenced Wythe, Jefferson and several other Virginians who became Founding Fathers and insisted upon {{the separation of powers}} between three branches of the new government. When John Robinson, the powerful speaker of the House of Burgesses, died, his estate was nearly insolvent (with many debts, as well as outstanding loans), and the accounts Robinson kept as Treasurer were also irregular. Instead of destroying redeemed paper currency after the French and Indian War, Robinson had lent it to his political supporters (fellow southern Virginia planters). Keeping the <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> helped these allies pay their own debts, but also tended to devalue the currency, as well as defied the redemption laws the legislature had passed. Robinson's executors kept the names of the politically powerful loan beneficiaries secret for decades, but did not manage to end the John Robinson estate scandal before the century itself ended. Moreover, on June 20, 1766, Colonel John Chiswell, father of Robinson's widow and business partner of Robinson, governor Fauquier and William Byrd III, killed merchant Robert Routledge (to whom he owed money) at the Cumberland Court House. Indicted for murder, Chiswell was brought under armed guard to Williamsburg for trial in the next session of the General Court (which included many men from distant counties who also served as Burgesses and was thus usually held at the same time). Before the group reached the Williamsburg jail, three judges (John Blair, Presley Thornton and Byrd) stopped them on the street and allowed Chiswell to post bail until September, since the next court session began in October.|$|E
