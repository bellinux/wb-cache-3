5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized <b>mortar</b> carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a <b>mortar.</b> In emergencies, the <b>mortar</b> could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the <b>mortar</b> could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the <b>mortar</b> mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of fly ash/slag ratio and liquid/binder ratio on strength of alkali-activated fly ash/slag (AAFS) <b>mortars.</b> Three liquid/binder ratios of 0. 35, 0. 5 and 0. 65 and three fly ash/slag ratios of 100 / 0, 50 / 50, and 0 / 100 were selected as variables to design and produce mixes of AAFS <b>mortars.</b> The compressive strength and flexural strength of alkali-activated fly ash/slag <b>mortars</b> were discussed and compared with reference <b>mortars</b> produced using ordinary Portland cement (OPC) <b>mortars.</b> Based on the results, both fly ash/slag ratio and the liquid/binder ratio are significant factors influencing the strengths of AAFS <b>mortars.</b> The strength of AAFS <b>mortars</b> except alkali-activated fly ash <b>mortars</b> is higher than that of OPC <b>mortars.</b> When the fly ash/slag ratio reaches 50 / 50, the AAFS <b>mortars</b> possesses the highest strength compared with the other <b>mortars.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|From 1916 the Stokes light trench <b>mortar</b> {{was issued}} to {{infantry}} {{to replace a}} range of trench catapults and smaller trench mortars, whilst it was also used in a battery at brigade-level to provide organic indirect fire support. In addition, individual soldiers often used a range of personnel weapons including knives, clubs, knuckle-dusters, revolvers and pistols. Snipers on the Western Front used Pattern 1914 Enfield sniper rifles with telescopic sights. Light horsemen also carried bayonets (as they were initially considered mounted infantry), although the Australian Mounted Division adopted cavalry swords in late 1917. Artillery included 18-pounders which equipped the field batteries, 4.5-inch howitzers used by the howitzer batteries, and 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers which equipped the heavy (siege) batteries. The 9.45-inch heavy <b>mortar</b> equipped a heavy trench <b>mortar</b> battery, while medium trench <b>mortar</b> batteries were equipped with the 2-inch medium <b>mortar,</b> and later the 6-inch <b>mortar.</b> Light Horse units were supported by British and Indian artillery. The main mount used by the light horse was the Waler, while draught horses were used by the artillery and for wheeled transport. Camels were also used, both as mounts and transport, and donkeys and mules were used as pack animals.|$|E

5|$|The M21 <b>Mortar</b> Motor Carriage (MMC) was a {{self-propelled}} artillery mount on a half-track chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II. It was equipped with an 81mm M1 <b>mortar</b> and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced.|$|E
5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the <b>mortar</b> (the M4's <b>mortar</b> was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's <b>mortar</b> was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E

Results indicate that with partial soaking time increasing, {{more and more}} sulfate sodium crystals grow on cement <b>mortars</b> surface, and cement <b>mortars</b> surface is denuded gradually. Compressive and flexural strength increase first and then decrease in the deterioration process. In the attack process, porosity of cement <b>mortars</b> decreases first and then increases. Lots of sodium sulfate crystals accumulate in pores of cement <b>mortars</b> and crystallization pressure is on the rise, resulting in physical crystallization attack taking place...|$|R
40|$|The current {{manuscript}} {{discusses the}} durability of historical <b>mortars.</b> The majority of the descriptions about those <b>mortars</b> are mainly related to the Roman period and refer the mixture of calcium hydroxide and pozzolans (volcanic ashes and calcined clays) as the right recipe to get strong and durable binders.

5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 17/18 February the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army {{launched}} an assault on FSB Andersen. The first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and <b>mortar</b> barrage {{in the early hours of}} the morning, followed by two waves of infantry each of company size. The attack focused on the south-west of the perimeter manned by 3 RAR's echelon and <b>mortar</b> platoon, as well as an American medium artillery battery. The perimeter wire was subsequently breached, but the attack was repulsed by <b>mortar</b> counter-battery fire, Claymore mines and the heavy weight of machine-gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and the American gunners. The communist barrage had had a devastating effect, falling among the American and New Zealand gun positions, the <b>mortar</b> lines and the battalion echelon, as well as scoring a direct hit on an Australian engineer standing patrol. A second attack shortly after, this time from the north, was repelled by small-arms fire from the forward Australian pits. Total Viet Cong casualties were unknown, although four bodies were found on the wire at dawn, while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of the perimeter and a suspected <b>mortar</b> base-plate location. Seven Australians and one American were killed, while 22 Australians and three Americans were wounded.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} of air lime-based <b>mortars</b> is now {{growing in the}} scientific community {{as well as in the}} companies devoted to construction materials. Air lime <b>mortars</b> were used for centuries and many architectural monuments show this type of <b>mortars.</b> Modern renders and coating <b>mortars</b> can also be made of air lime as the main binding phase. The use of several admixtures to improve different characteristics of these <b>mortars</b> is now explored and discussed in the current presentation. Insights into the action mechanisms are addressed. Water-repellent agents, such as sodium oleate and calcium stearate, increase the durability of air lime <b>mortars</b> in the face of ageing processes. Two water retainers (hydroxypropylguar and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) have also been proven to increase the viscosity in the fresh mixtures and the durability of the hardened <b>mortars.</b> The role of a starch derivative is also discussed: the influence of the dosage of the admixture is presented. Shrinkage cracks were minimized in starch-bearing render <b>mortars</b> applied onto an absorbent substrate. Strength of air lime <b>mortars</b> can be increased upon the addition of pozzolanic additives: nanosilica and metakaolin. The combined use of these pozzolans along with superplasticizers shows an outstanding overall improvement of strength and durability of lime <b>mortars...</b>|$|R
