40|$|In current 3 -dimensional multi-pass {{repair weld}} {{simulations}} each pass is generally modelled {{as a single}} continuous weld bead using either a simultaneous bead deposition or a progressive bead deposition moving heat source approach. In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} weld beads for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a <b>multi-bead,</b> single MMA weld pass on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single bead weld test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead laying methods (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in weld beads remote from the stop end. However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a <b>multi-bead</b> weld pass on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a <b>multi-bead</b> weld pass can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a <b>multi-bead</b> weld pass using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the weld bead) can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|E

40|$|Wire and arc {{additive}} manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising alternative to traditional subtractive manufacturing for fabricating large aerospace components that feature high buy-to-fly ratio. Since the WAAM process builds up a part with complex geometry through the deposition of weld beads on a layer-by-layer basis, {{it is important}} to model the geometry of a single weld bead as well as the <b>multi-bead</b> overlapping process in order to achieve high surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the fabricated parts. This study firstly builds models for a single weld bead through various curve fitting methods.

The overlapping principle is then detailed to model the geometry of multiple beads overlapping together. The tangent overlapping model (TOM) is established and the concept of the critical centre distance for stable <b>multi-bead</b> overlapping processes is presented. The proposed TOM is shown to provide a much better approximation to the experimental measurements when compared with the traditional flat-top overlapping model (FOM).

This study {{focuses on the}} development of an automated manufacturing system in order to free the operator from intervening in the analysis of the CAD model, planning the deposition path, and then manually setting the welding process parameters. Firstly, the relationship between single bead geometry and welding process parameters is established through an artificial neural network (ANN) model.

Circulating cytokines and other signaling molecules were measured using a Luminex <b>multi-bead</b> analyte detection system. Hierarchical clustering was performed on plasma values to create patient subgroups. Enrichment analysis identified clinical outcomes significantly different according to these chemically defined patient subgroups.

40|$|Superparamagnetic {{microbeads}} (SPBs) {{have been}} widely used to capture and manipulate biological entities in a fluid environment. Chip-based magnetic actuation provides a means to transport SPBs in lab-on-a-chip technologies. This is usually accomplished using the stray magnetic field from patterned magnetic micro structures or domain walls in magnetic nanowires. Recently, many studies have focused on sub-micron sized antidot array of magnetic materials because non-magnetic holes affect the micromagnetic properties of film. In this work, a method is presented for directed transport of SPBs on magnetic antidot patterned substrates by applying a rotating elliptical magnetic field. We find a critical frequency for transport beyond which the bead dynamics transition from stepwise locomotion to local oscillation. We also find that the out-of-plane (Hoop) and in-plane (Hip) field magnitudes play crucial roles in triggering bead movements. Namely, we find threshold values in Hoop and Hip that depend on bead size which can be used to independently and remotely to address specific bead populations in a <b>multi-bead</b> mixture. In addition, these behaviors are explained in terms of the dynamic potential energy landscapes computed from micromagnetic simulations of the substrate magnetization configuration. Furthermore, we show that large-area magnetic patterns suitable for particle transport and sorting can be fabricated through a self-assembly lithography technique, which provides a simple, cost-effective means to integrate magnetic actuation into microfluidic systems. Finally, we observed the transport of bead motion on antidot arrays of multilayered structures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and found that the dynamics of SPBs on a PMA substrate are much faster than on a substrate with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our findings provide new insights into the enhanced transport of SPBs using PMA substrates and offer flexibility in device applications using the transportation or sorting of magnetic particles. by Minae Ouk.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} advancements in the modelling, optimisation, {{process control}} and mechanical performance of novel high deposition rate {{gas metal arc}} welding processes for large scale additive manufacturing applications. One of the main objectives {{of this study was to}} develop fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved during processing with particular focus on single layer welds made of carbon steel using both pulsed-current {{gas metal arc welding}} and cold metal transfer processes. The effects of interactions between critical welding process variables and weld bead and plate fusion characteristics are studied for single and multi-layers. It was shown that several bead and plate fusion characteristics are strongly affected by the contact tip to work distance, TRIM, wire feed speed, wire feed speed to travel speed ratio, and wire diameter in pulsed-current gas metal arc welding. The arc-length control, dynamic correction and the contact tip to work distance are shown to strongly influence the weld bead geometry in the cold metal transfer process. This fundamental knowledge was essential to ensure the successful development of predictive interaction models capable of determining the weld bead geometry from the welding process parameters. The models were developed using the least-squares analysis and multiple linear regression method. The gas tungsten constricted arc welding process was utilised for the first time for out-of-chamber fabrication of a large scale and high-quality Ti- 6 Al- 4 V component. The main focus was, however, in the use of the cold metal transfer process for improving out-of-chamber deposition of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at much higher deposition rates. The effect of the cold metal transfer process on the grain refinement features in the fusion zone of single layer welds under different torch gas shielding conditions was investigated. It was shown that significant grain refinement occurs with increasing helium content. The morphological features and static mechanical performance of the resulting multi-layered Ti- 6 Al- 4 V walls were also examined and compared with those in gas tungsten constricted arc welding. The results show that a considerable improvement in static tensile properties is obtained in both testing directions with cold metal transfer over gas tungsten constricted arc welding. It was suggested that this improvement in the mechanical behaviour could be due to the formation of more fine-grained structures,which are therefore more isotropic. The average ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the as-deposited Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material processed via cold metal transfer meet the minima specification values recommended for most Ti- 6 Al- 4 V products. Neutron diffraction technique was used to establish the effect of repeated thermo-mechanical cycling on the generation, evolution and distribution of residual stresses during wire and arc additive manufacturing. The results show a significant redistribution of longitudinal residual stresses along both the substrate and <b>multi-bead</b> with repeated deposition.

40|$|Electron beam {{freeform}} fabrication (EBF 3) {{is a member}} of an emerging class of direct manufacturing processes known as solid {{freeform fabrication}} (SFF); another member of the class is the laser deposition process. Successful application of the EBF 3 process requires precise control of a number of process parameters such as the EB power, speed, and metal feed rate in order to ensure thermal management; good fusion between the substrate and the first layer and between successive layers; minimize part distortion and residual stresses; and control the microstructure of the finished product. This is the only effort thus far that has addressed computer simulation of the EBF 3 process. The models developed in this effort can assist in reducing the number of trials in the laboratory or on the shop floor while making high-quality parts. With some modifications, their use can be further extended to the simulation of laser, TIG (tungsten inert gas), and other deposition processes. A solid mechanics-based finite element code, ABAQUS, was chosen as the primary engine in developing these models whereas a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, Fluent, was used in a support role. Several innovative concepts were developed, some of which are highlighted below. These concepts were implemented in a number of new computer models either in the form of stand-alone programs or as user subroutines for ABAQUS and Fluent codes. A database of thermo-physical, mechanical, fluid, and metallurgical properties of stainless steel 304 was developed. Computing models for Gaussian and raster modes of the electron beam heat input were developed. Also, new schemes were devised to account for the heat sink effect during the deposition process. These innovations, and others, lead to improved models for thermal management and prediction of transient/residual stresses and distortions. Two approaches for the prediction of microstructure were pursued. The first was an empirical approach involving the computation of thermal gradient, solidification rate, and velocity (G,R,V) coupled {{with the use of a}} solidification map that should be known a priori. The second approach relies completely on computer simulation. For this purpose a criterion for the prediction of morphology was proposed, which was combined with three alternative models for the prediction of microstructure; one based on solidification kinetics, the second on phase diagram, and the third on differential scanning calorimetry data. The last was found to be the simplest and the most versatile; it can be used with multicomponent alloys and rapid solidification without any additional difficulty. For the purpose of (limited) experimental validation, finite element models developed in this effort were applied to three different shapes made of stainless steel 304 material, designed expressly for this effort with an increasing level of complexity. These finite element models require large computation time, especially when applied to deposits with multiple adjacent beads and layers. This problem can be overcome, to some extent, by the use of fast, multi-core computers. Also, due to their numerical nature coupled with the fact that solid mechanics- based models are being used to represent the material behavior in liquid and vapor phases as well, the models have some inherent approximations that become more pronounced when dealing with <b>multi-bead</b> and multi-layer deposits...|$|E
