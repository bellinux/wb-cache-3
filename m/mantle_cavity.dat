5|$|Pulmonates {{are mostly}} land {{snails and slugs}} that have {{developed}} a simple lung from the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> An externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air {{to be taken into}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> lung.|$|E

5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E
50|$|Members of Bdellonemertea are all commensal, {{living in}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavities</b> of bivalves. The only non-marine and non-bivalve hosted species, Malacobdella auriculae, is doubtful. It was {{described}} in 1847 by Émile Blanchard {{on the basis of}} a single drawing of his colleague and probably wasn't even a nemertean. Malacobdella feed on small food particles that are brought into the mollusk's ctenidia.|$|R
50|$|Male individuals, being motile, {{are able}} {{to move to the}} {{vicinity}} of the aperture of the sessile females before liberating sperm into the water. Capsules containing eggs are brooded in the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavities</b> of the females. The ova are about 300μm in diameter and the veliger larvae that hatch have two and a half whorls of shell and are about 600μm long. These crawl or swim away and soon undergo metamorphosis into juveniles which are all males. They feed on phytoplankton and grow rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} turbellarians, all the species in this order are either {{commensal}} or parasitic. They {{can be found}} living on crustaceans, molluscs, and, in some species, even turtles. The commensal species typically live in the gill or <b>mantle</b> <b>cavities</b> of their hosts, while the parasites live inside the digestive system. Anatomically, temnocephalidans can be distinguished from related groups {{by the presence of}} an adhesive disc on the underside for attachment to the host, and of a number of finger-like projections arising from the head.|$|R
5|$|A few nemerteans are scavengers, {{and these}} {{generally}} have good distance chemoreception ("smell") {{and are not}} selective about their prey. A few species live commensally inside the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> of molluscs and feed on micro-organisms filtered out by the host.|$|E
5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. The snail serves as first {{intermediate}} host to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} this small snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. This small snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> Another ciliate found in the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGiant clams (Hippopus and Tridacna species) {{are thought}} to play various {{ecological}} roles in coral reef ecosystems, {{but most of these}} have not previously been quantified. Using data from the literature and our own studies we elucidate the ecological functions of giant clams. We show how their tissues are food for a wide array of predators and scavengers, while their discharges of live zooxanthellae, faeces, and gametes are eaten by opportunistic feeders. The shells of giant clams provide substrate for colonization by epibionts, while commensal and ectoparasitic organisms live within their <b>mantle</b> <b>cavities.</b> Giant clams increase the topographic heterogeneity of the reef, act as reservoirs of zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.), and also potentially counteract eutrophication via water filtering. Finally, dense populations of giant clams produce large quantities of calcium carbonate shell material that are eventually incorporated into the reef framework. Unfortunately, giant clams are under great pressure from overfishing and extirpations are likely to be detrimental to coral reefs. A greater understanding of the numerous contributions giant clams provide will reinforce the case for their conservation...|$|R
40|$|Under this USDOE-NETL contract, the {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas fluorescens {{is being developed}} as a biocontrol agent for zebra mussels. The specific purpose of the contract is to identify biotic and abiotic factors that affect mussel kill. Ingestion of these bacteria by zebra mussels is required to achieve kill, and tests evaluating factors that relate to mussel feeding are contained in this report. Specifically {{the impact of the}} following two factors were investigated: (1) Mussel siphoning behavior [...] In nature, zebra mussels typically have their two shells spread apart and their inhalant siphon tube extended from between their shells for taking food particles into their <b>mantle</b> <b>cavities</b> (Fig. 1). Our tests indicated that there is a direct correlation between mussel siphoning activity and mussel mortality achieved by a bacterial treatment. Therefore, to encourage mussel feeding on bacteria, future pipe treatments within power plants should be carried out using procedures which minimize disturbance to mussel siphoning. 2. Naturally suspended particle loads [...] Since bacterial cells are lethal only if ingested by mussels, waters containing very high levels of naturally suspended particles might reduce the mortality that can be achieved by a bacterial treatment. If true, this inhibition might occur as a result of particle exclusion, i. e., there could be reduced ingestion of bacterial cells since they represent a reduced percentage of all particles ingested. Our tests indicated that a range of particle concentrations that might naturally exist in a turbid river did not inhibit mussel kill by the bacterial cells, but that an artificially high load of natural particles was capable of causing a reduction in kill. To be conservative, therefore, future pipe treatments should be timed to occur when intake waters have relatively low quantities of naturally suspended particulate matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} of the lophophore and the digestive system are recognized as two of the diagnostic characters in the defi− nition of higher brachiopod taxa, and hence {{play a major role}} in their phylogenetic analysis, their structure, however, is very rarely fossilized. Here we describe and interpret specimens of the brachiopod Lingulellotreta malongensis, from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstätte (South China), one of the earliest known taxa of the Lingulellotretidae, in which lophophores and intact, U−shaped digestive tracts are extraordinarily well−preserved. The lophophore, with clearly pre− served tentacles, corresponds to an early spirolophe developmental stage. The digestive tract consists of a mouth, esopha− gus, distended stomach, intestine and an anterior anus, and differs from that of the Chengjiang obolid Lingulella chengjiangensis by the presence of the dilated stomach and by the absence of a looped intestine as in Lingula. In addition, the relative sizes of the <b>mantle</b> and visceral <b>cavities</b> of Lingulellotreta malongensis also are described. These fossils dem− onstrate that by the Atdabanian brachiopods had already possessed advanced features, and suggest that a lophophore and a U−shaped intestine with an anterior anus are brachiopod plesiomorphies...|$|R
5|$|The {{dorsal part}} of the body wall is a mantle (or pallium) which secretes {{calcareous}} s, plates or shells. It overlaps the body with enough spare room to form a <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The atria of {{the heart}} also {{function}} {{as part of the}} excretory system by filtering waste products out of the blood and dumping it into the coelom as urine. A pair of nephridia ("little kidneys") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional waste products into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
40|$|Between the Platte and Niobrara Rivers {{in western}} and central Nebraska lie over 25, 000 square {{kilometers}} of dune sand. The dunes {{have lost their}} sculptured shapes and windswept edges, being shrouded beneath a mantle of grass and fine loess soil. Only at the blowouts, where wind has cut away this <b>mantle</b> forming <b>cavities</b> in the sides of hills, is the sand exposed. Dotting this rolling prairie grassland in the depressions between the dunes are small lakes. Over 2000 lakes of widely varied salinities and alkalinities accent the topography of the dunes. Blue Lake, Roundup Lake, Goose Lake, and Bob’s Lake, all located within the Crescent Lake National Refuge, exhibit a great diversity in their chemical and biological characteristics. These four lakes, which spanned the spectrum of one chemical parameter, alkalinity, were studied over several seasons to establish the interrelationships between the chemical parameters of these waters and their biological constituents. Of no little significance is the proximity of these lakes to one another, ensuring the same potential inocula for each system and minimizing the microclimate variability among the lakes. Each lake is distinctly different in morphometry, chemistry and history; nevertheless, certain trends became evident when the data for various parameters from each lake were compared. The objectives of this research were to: 1) Identify the range of alkalinity within the lakes near the Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge, 2) Select lakes for in-depth study which spanned the observed range of alkalinity, 3) Record the seasonal variations in selected physical and chemical parameters {{as well as the}} abundance and composition of the phytoplankton, 4) Determine the rates of primary productivity by C- 14 uptake, 5) Determine the effect of the varying measured physical and chemical parameters on the abundance and composition of phytoplankton by correlation analysis, 6) Establish a data base of the limnological conditions within these lakes to serve as a reference for future research. Water samples were collected from the four lakes over an 18 -month period between June 1977 and September 1978. Weekly or bi-weekly sampling was conducted during the summers while monthly samples were collected during the remaining period. Marked chemical and biological differences were observed among the lakes studied. Common mechanisms were responsible for the observed variations within each lake. Physical features, most notably the seasonal hydrological cycle of evaporation, dilution, solution, and even at times flooding, controlled many of the parameters studied. Wind also {{played an important role in}} each of the lakes, contributing to their formation and determining both their stability and productivity. Differences in morphometry, sediment composition, and history have made each of these lakes unique. The variations observed show that the lakes move in the same directions, but distinctly.

40|$|AbstractThe {{gastropod}} <b>mantle,</b> or pallial, <b>cavity</b> and {{its associated}} structures {{have served as a}} phylobase for studies of gastropod relationships for well over 100 years. We review C. M. Yonge's model for the evolution of the gastropod pallial cavity published a little more than 50 years ago, as well as its subsequent mutation by other authors. We then use a recently published (Ponder & Lindberg 1997) phylogenetic hypothesis of gastropod relationships to explore character transformations of attributes associated with the pallial cavity. Significant features of the evolution of the gastropod pallial cavity are the reduction or loss of structures (gill, osphradium, hypobranchial gland) and associated neural and reno-vascular systems {{on the right side of}} the cavity, and mechanisms for coping with an increase in overall body size in many clades. The loss of pallial cavity structures has occurred independently in several major clades, the patellogastropods, neritopsines, cocculinoideans, and apogastropods, and probably more than once in the vetigastropods. Evolution of the pallial cavity and associated structures is discussed for each of the clades in which largely different solutions are found to enable the achievement of larger body size. A seeming contradiction reduction of gills with increasing respiratory demand due to increasing body size is a feature of the group. We also examine possible linkages between the evolution of the pallial cavity and other morphological characters that were not suspect as a prioricorrelates of one another. The uncritical application of a current taxonomy to results obtained from applying the comparative method used to study form and function has been a significant hindrance to our understanding of evolution in the last several decades. C. M. Yonge's scenario published in 1947 was close to our phylogenetically based hypothesis. However, when it was later forced into agreement with the dominant classification of the last half-century (Thiele 1929 – 35), most of the points of agreement between the original scenario of Yonge and our phylogenetic hypothesis vanished, with four separate derivations reduced to a single event. This is an example of a Procrustean evolutionary scenario fitting the data to a classification scheme, with taxonomy rather than phylogeny used as the bed...|$|R
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity.</b> The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the body}} are {{openings}} to the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> which contains the gills (ctenidia) and openings to the excretory and reproductive systems. At {{the front of}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> lies the siphon, which the squid uses for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> and expelled out of the siphon in a fast, strong jet. The direction of the siphon can be changed, to suit the direction of travel.|$|E
25|$|The {{anatomy of}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> is {{described}} in Sullivan et al. (1974) and Jurberg et al. (1997).|$|E
25|$|Inside the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity,</b> {{beyond the}} siphon, lies the visceral mass, which {{is covered by}} a thin, {{membranous}} epidermis. Under this are all the major internal organs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cephalopods}} {{possess a}} single pair of large nephridia. Filtered nitrogenous waste {{is produced in}} the pericardial cavity of the branchial hearts, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral vena cava project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts beat. This action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the <b>mantle</b> <b>cavity</b> through a pore.|$|E
