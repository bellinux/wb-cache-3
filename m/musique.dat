5|$|The first {{published}} score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de <b>Musique,</b> RV196), dated 1913. Publication {{of the full}} orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After {{the revival of the}} work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de <b>Musique,</b> RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and <b>Musique</b> funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in <b>Musique</b> funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although <b>Musique</b> funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns {{held only}} one {{teaching}} post, at the École de <b>Musique</b> Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there {{for less than}} five years. It was nevertheless important {{in the development of}} French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.|$|E

5|$|An old blind woman, {{who came}} to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Fauré play and advised Toussaint-Honoré {{to send him to}} the École de <b>Musique</b> Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music, better known as the , which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After {{reflecting}} for a year, Fauré's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.|$|E
5|$|Experimental pop is {{pop music}} that cannot be {{categorized}} within traditional musical boundaries or which attempts to push elements of existing popular forms into new areas. It may incorporate experimental {{techniques such as}} <b>musique</b> concrète, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts. Often, the compositional process {{involves the use of}} electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements, and its settings may combine sound-based work and note-based work, though not always simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Fauré was a {{founding}} member of the Société Nationale de <b>Musique,</b> formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Saëns, to promote new French music. Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, César Franck, Édouard Lalo and Jules Massenet. Fauré became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.|$|E

5|$|In 1620 Peerson's {{collection}} Private Musicke was published. It contained secular music, including madrigals and consort songs, {{for one or}} two voices {{accompanied by}} viols or virginals.

5|$|In December 1883 Messager and Chabrier {{gave the}} first {{performance}} of the latter's Trois valses romantiques at the Société Nationale de <b>Musique.</b> The concert also included the two-piano version premiere of España. A close friend of Chabrier from the 1880s until Chabrier's death, Messager had a great admiration for Chabrier's opera Gwendoline and swore that he would conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the published vocal score of the work.|$|E
5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of <b>musique</b> concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|Kaegi {{discovered}} Pierre Schaeffer, <b>musique</b> concrète and the GRM {{radio broadcasts}} in Paris in 1951, yet his 1950s compositions are for traditional instruments; Ariadne in Zürich is for clarinet and piano 4 hands, Miniaturen, for oboe, bassoon and cimbalom, while the 1956 Sonate is for clarinet and piano. During the next decade, however, Werner Kaegi embraced electronic music {{and became a}} pioneer of Swiss electroacoustic music, predating other composers in the field, such as Bruno Spoerri and Rainer Boesch.|$|E

5|$|The first barcarolle was {{dedicated}} to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de <b>Musique</b> in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before {{the introduction of the}} second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.|$|E
5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de <b>Musique</b> with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.|$|E

5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} {{to the music of}} his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of Mozart's 40th Symphony (1844), through the sets Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire (1847 and 1861) and the set Souvenirs de <b>musique</b> de chambre (1862), which include transcriptions of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, Haydn, Gluck, and others. In this context should be mentioned Alkan's extensive cadenza for Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Alkan's transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Couperin and Rameau, were frequently played during the series of Petits Concerts given by Alkan at Erard.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Musique</b> funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} in Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of <b>musique</b> concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E
