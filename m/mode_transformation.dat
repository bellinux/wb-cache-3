50|$|Transformations {{are special}} skills that allows players {{to take on}} the form of a Paladin or Dark Knight, each of which gives {{significant}} boosts to stats. Transformations can only be activated once on the hour and resets every hour (i.e., a player can transform at 09:59 and again at 10:00). However, a player cannot transform more than once during a battle run. When battling in transformation <b>mode,</b> <b>transformation</b> experience is rewarded to the player in which they can increase their transformation level and put points into specific transformation skills. However, not all skills can be attained thus each player can vary in transformation abilities whether it be a supportive or offensive play style. Both transformations increases Health, Stamina, Defense, Physical and Magical Attack Power, SP Gain, Knock-down Resistance, Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, and Agility. Paladins tend to focus on Defense while Dark Knights possess higher Physical and Magical Attack Power. Players can achieve a higher degree of transformation completely changing the appearance of the character as well as abilities. Players attain a more powerful arsenal of abilities and stat boosts when undergoing this second transformation. However, this second transformation costs at least 10 AP and 2 SP Bars (500 SP) to activate. Transformations last for two minutes, while the second transformation lasts for one minute. However, if the first transformation's time goes beyond the second transformation's time, the remaining time for the second transformation will be that during the first transformation (i.e., engaging second transformation with thirty seconds left will have the second transformation lasting thirty seconds).|$|E

40|$|AbstractAtomic-scale {{finite element}} {{analyses}} show that 2 : 1 internal resonance mechanism {{exists in a}} range of single-walled carbon nanorings (10 – 60). When an initial radial breathing mode (RBM) vibration with sufficiently high velocity is imposed to a nanoring, circumferential flexural modes (CFMs) can be excited after a period of RBM-dominated vibration. Then, <b>mode</b> <b>transformations</b> between RBM and the excited CFMs can be observed in the subsequent vibration process. When single-walled carbon nanorings are assembled to make double- or triple-walled carbon nanorings, the 2 : 1 internal resonance may change to 1 : 1 internal resonance in a specific ring due to the strong interactions between these nanorings. Furthermore, <b>mode</b> <b>transformations</b> between RBM and the excited CFMs can become unstable in a specific ring if the excited CFMs in neighbouring layer rings are not symmetrically matching between each other. 2 : 1 internal resonance is also shown in selected armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes except in a special case (armchair (9, 9)), in which 1 : 1 internal resonance occurs...|$|R

Systematic measurements of the resonance fre-quency and the damping rate {{as a function of}} the lateral confinement electric field strength shows clear evidence of the oscillation <b>mode</b> <b>transformation.</b> A pronounced change corresponding to the <b>mode</b> <b>transformation</b> was ob-served in the damping rate. When 2 D electrons are confined in a strong lateral electric field, the damping is weak. As the lateral confinement electric field is reduced below a certain threshold value, an abrupt enhancement of the damping rate is observed. We hypothesize that the weak damping mode in the strong lateral confinement electric field is the compressive density oscillation of the electrons near the edge (conventional EMP) and the strong damping mode in the weak confinement field is the coupled mode of conventional EMP and the boundary displacement wave (BDW). The observation of the strong damping in the BDW–EMP coupled mode is a manifestation of the nearly incompressible feature of strongly interacting classical electrons, which agrees with earlier theoretical predictions...|$|E

The two interferometry modes are initially empty spin states that get spontaneously populated {{in the process}} of parametric amplification.

Finally, a matched second period of spin exchange is performed that nonlinearly amplifies the output signal and maps the phase onto readily detectable first moments.

In the non-cooperative mode, spheroidal cementite particles grow directly from the undissolved carbides in the austenite phase. The transformation product is a fully spheroidized microstructure. In this study, the parameters promoting the occurrence of DET in a hypereutectoid steel (austenitization temperature, cooling rate, presence of proeutectoid cementite in the initial microstructure) were investigated.

By analyzing their kinetics, three types of competitions were identified between these <b>transformation</b> <b>modes</b> : (1) vs. (2), (2) vs. (3) and (4) vs. (5).
