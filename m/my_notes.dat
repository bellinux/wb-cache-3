500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> to remind myself {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The poem {{most likely}} {{originated}} in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: [...] "I am inclined {{to believe that the}} Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [...] also: Though I am aware that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> on the poem." [...] Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called [...] "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted to work out the ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

The United States also provided strategic operational advice to the Iraqis to better use their assets in combat...

2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} hit <b>my</b> <b>notes,</b> how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head. [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2016 review, Jill Duffy of PC Magazine {{wrote that}} the {{interface}} was best described as [...] "simplicity", and criticized it for offering list and grid views that did not make finding information quick or easy. Adding that [...] "Most of <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> are text-based recipes, which are quite long", Duffy said the list view was [...] "even worse" [...] than the grid view as it only showed [...] "one note at a time, and it's the most recently edited note." [...] She {{wrote that the}} web interface was lacking in functionality present in the apps. The mobile apps offering to take a photo and run optical character recognition to have the scan turned into text {{was described as a}} [...] "shining star", with the comment [...] "It's an amazing feature, and it works very well". She also criticized the lack of formatting options, and that sharing options [...] "is possible but not very refined".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the members}} left Opeth, Mikael Åkerfeldt and David Isberg {{began to write}} the songs. Åkerfeldt commented about: [...] "As you might {{understand}} I {{was more or less}} influenced by the occult back then, although in no serious manner. Music wise I was really into the twisted, dark, and evil-sounding riffs. The lyrics written by both me and David were pure Satanic chantings!" [...] According to Åkerfeldt, [...] "the idea for Opeth was for it to be evil—satanic lyrics and evil riffs. I chose <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> so they sounded evil." [...] The first two songs that Åkerfeldt and Isberg wrote were [...] "Requiem of Lost Souls" [...] and [...] "Mystique of the Baphomet" [...] (later [...] "Mark of the Damned" [...] and later [...] "Forest of October"). When Isberg quit the band, Åkerfeldt and Peter Lindgren [...] "really felt that we had found a real original way of playing. There were at the time almost no other band [...] using that many harmonies as we did." [...] "Forest of October" [...] "is the best song on the album", according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt says he doesn't remember what it is about, and that he only remembers that he wrote the lyrics to sound like the music.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{open letter}} {{published}} in The New York Sun, Kenneth W. Stein, Director of the Institute for the Study of Modern Israel of Emory University, who was {{the founder of the}} Middle East program at the Carter Center and the Center's first director (February 1984 – 1986), presents criticisms of the book as follows: [...] "President Carter's book on the Middle East, a title too inflammatory to even print, is not based on unvarnished analysis; it is replete with factual errors, copied materials not cited, superficialities, glaring omissions, and simply invented segments." [...] In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: [...] "Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third person in the room, and <b>my</b> <b>notes</b> of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book." [...] He adds: [...] "Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or to unpack it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook. Having little access to Arabic and Hebrew sources, I believe, clearly handicapped his understanding and analyses of how history has unfolded over the last decade." [...] At {{the end of the first}} week of December, Karen DeYoung reported that Stein had not yet provided a full outline of such alleged factual errors in the book.|$|E
