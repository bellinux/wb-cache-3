5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role in returning the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes free trial members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly subscription model. He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the subscription model and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as people see the game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month.</b> Yoshida has no plans to change to a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E

25|$|Thirty years before, Henry III had deposed three claimants to the papacy, {{and thereby}} {{rendered}} an acknowledged {{service to the}} Church. When Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he was less successful, as he lacked {{the support of the}} people. In Germany there was a rapid and general feeling in favor of Gregory, and the princes took the opportunity to carry out their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the papal decision. When at Whitsun the king proposed to discuss the measures to be taken against Gregory VII in a council of his nobles, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the golden opportunity for renewing their rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month.</b> This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E

The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month....</b> And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values.

500|$|In {{stand alone}} PV systems {{batteries}} are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid-connected photovoltaic power system, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [...] Credits are normally rolled over from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month</b> and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are {{a small fraction of the}} grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.|$|E
500|$|High-profile {{advertising}} {{was central}} to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out {{in stark contrast to}} the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>month,</b> were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan [...] "Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you". The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as [...] "a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs." [...] The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed ("it's still very simple to teach yourself computing") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as [...] "eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was [...] "designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain." [...] Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose: ...|$|E
