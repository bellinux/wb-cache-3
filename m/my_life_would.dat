25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

[...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When I was a child, I felt that if only I could change myself, <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E

As President and First Lady, the Reagans {{were reported to}} display their affection frequently, with one press secretary noting, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] Ronald often called Nancy [...] "Mommy"; she called him [...] "Ronnie". While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy wrote in her diary, [...] "Nothing can happen to my Ronnie. <b>My</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be over." [...] In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, [...] "whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When her husband was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease In 1998, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were {{very much in love}} and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy was known for the focused and attentive look, termed [...] "the Gaze", that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances.|$|E

500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E

It was my intention to injure the building and scare the owners. I sincerely regret that these unfortunate men lost their lives.

2500|$|Although his {{journals}} clarify {{some aspects}} of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: [...] "Were I to die now the effect of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance {{and have a great}} effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right." ...|$|E

I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like, Clerks III, done. So everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you I failed into Clerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man.

2500|$|Urmuz's arrival to {{literary}} history {{took place in}} the atmosphere of Bucharest gymnasia. It was at this junction that he became a mate of Ciprian, who later described their encounter as momentous: [...] "I don't much believe in destiny. [...] Yet I find it such an odd incident that my bench mate, from my failing grade year through to my high school graduation, was [...] this tiny man of a rare originality, who had a massive say on how <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> turn up." [...] Ciprian describes what follows as his own [...] "initiation in artistic matters": he recalls conversations with [...] "Ciriviș" [...] where they debated the [...] "perfection" [...] of Ancient Greek sculpture, and mentions that young Urmuz, unlike himself, regarded theater as a [...] "minor art". Instead, Urmuz preferred to attend concerts at the Romanian Atheneum, and, Ciprian writes, had an advanced understanding of absolute music even at age thirteen. Reportedly, the young man was also in the attendance at lectures given by Titu Maiorescu, a philosopher and aesthete who had influenced both Eminescu and Caragiale.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by the Sunday Times on 23 July 1989, Allan recalled a significant episode when Terre'Blanche had drunkenly hammered on her flat door and eventually slept on the doorstep {{and that she had}} to step over him the next morning. Despite her objections, her editor, Myburgh, insisted on publishing answering machine messages allegedly by Terre'Blanche, accompanied by a denial by Allan of counter claims that he had made against her. Allan recounted conversations with her editor [...] "After the bomb he said, 'Right, we'll publish the tapes.' I said I didn't think that would be wise, as the security police had told me <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> be in danger. He said, 'We're going to blow them out of the water.'" [...] She had just emerged from a course of traction for her seized back, and was then rushed to hospital with a bleeding ulcer because of the stress. Allan fled to Britain permanently for security reasons in the same week that the transcripts were published. The tapes were the Sunday Times lead story published on 30 July 1989 with the front-page headline 'JANI: MY ET TAPES'.|$|E
2500|$|While Meyerbeer's {{popularity}} has faded, {{the fortunes of}} another French composer of the era have risen steeply {{over the past few}} decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a backward-looking conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Opéra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind. Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would {{have to wait until the}} second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, [...] "If only I could live till I am a hundred and forty, <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>would</b> become decidedly interesting". Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy Béatrice et Bénédict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation.|$|E
