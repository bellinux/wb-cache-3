This situation was partly alleviated by the reinforcement of No. 151 Wing RAF on September 7, 1941 at Vaenga airfield. The Wing was tasked with providing Hawker Hurricane aircraft and training for the Russians, but also flew 365 sorties over the Murmansk area, accounting for 14 German aircraft kills.|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} is an energy-saving, {{environmentally friendly}} and healthy means of air dehumidification. A liquid desiccant-based all-air {{air conditioning system}} is studied by simulation. Two different modes of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> between the return air and the fresh air are compared, that is mixing before and mixing after the liquid desiccant dehumidifier, respectively. System performance and total energy consumption of the two modes under different operation conditions are obtained. The results show that <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> after dehumidification consumes less energy than <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> before dehumidification. Coefficient of performance (COP) of the all-air system with <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> after dehumidification is higher. The differences of COP and energy consumption between the two <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes increase when the outdoor air temperature and relative humidity increase. Practical application: Liquid desiccant based all-air system is quite suitable for museums, libraries and computer centres where water {{is not allowed to}} enter the space for property safety and strict thermal-hygrometric control is necessary. The results of this paper provide guidelines on the selection of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes in liquid desiccant-based all-air systems, considering energy consumption and system COP.

Despite deteriorating weather conditions and revolts within the Yugoslav forces, combat patrols continued. At 12:00 on 11 April, all aircraft were grounded by the weather. On 12 April, aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment took to the air again, chasing German reconnaissance aircraft, but the IK-2s did not record any victories. The following day, the 4th Fighter Regiment continued carrying out sorties, but around 12:00 the commander of the 2nd <b>Mixed</b> <b>Air</b> Brigade ordered the remaining aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment to be destroyed, and all personnel to withdraw via road to Sarajevo.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{preparations}} in turn were meager. While the Soviets anticipated a German invasion {{with possible}} Finnish support, Stalin {{did not expect}} a German attack along the entire border so early. The border was heavily fortified, but the Soviet leadership was unprepared for the sudden German attack. The main adversary of the German-Finnish force was the Soviet Northern Front consisting of the 7th and 14th Armies stationed in the Arctic. They were commanded by Lieutenant-General Markian Popov. On 23 August 1941, the Northern Front was split up into the Karelian Front and the Leningrad Front, commanded by Valerian Frolov and Popov and respectively. Frolov remained {{in command of the}} Karelian Front until 1 September, when he was replaced by Roman Panin due to a promotion. During the first weeks the Axis would enjoy numerical superiority, as the Soviets only had 150,000 men stationed north of Lake Ladoga along the border. The Axis powers also possessed air superiority, as Soviet Karelian was only protected by the 1st and 55th <b>Mixed</b> <b>Air</b> Divisions, totaling 273 serviceable aircraft. These were considered to be heavily outclassed by their enemy counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|Benito Mussolini had {{no plans}} to invade Egypt, {{intending}} to remain on the defensive in Libya if war came. After the fall of France in 1940, the 5th Army could send reinforcements east and on 7 August, Mussolini ordered an invasion, to occupy Egypt and establish a land connexion with Italian East Africa. In August a lull fell on the frontier, most of the British armoured units had been withdrawn from the frontier to Mersa Matruh, to conserve their ability to defend the port and the 7th Support Group took over, to establish observation posts from Sollum to Fort Maddalena, ready to delay an Italian offensive; Hussars reconnoitred further into Libya. The Libyan divisions lacked the transport necessary to operate with the Maletti Group, which had a medium, two mixed and four light tank battalions, on the escarpment and were redeployed to the coast road. On 9 September, the Maletti Group got lost en route to Sidi Omar and Graziani cancelled a flanking move and concentrated on the coast road, with five divisions and the Maletti Group; the 4th Blackshirt and 64th Catanzaro divisions stayed in reserve at Tobruk.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fans on <b>air</b> temperature and humidity distribution in an arched roof greenhouse. The greenhouse was occupied by a tomato crop and equipped with two side roll-up openings for ventilation, a PVC pipe heating system and a fan coil heater. Furthermore, for <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> purposes, an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. Air temperature and relative humidity was simultaneously recorded in 17 positions equally distributed inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effects of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan on microclimate distribution, {{it was found that}} the mixing fan increased microclimate homogeneity. On the other hand, the use of fan-coil heater was found to increase microclimate heterogeneity. The maximum absolute air temperature and relative humidity difference (observed above the crop) between the centre of the greenhouse and the different measuring positions at the same level, was about 1 °C and 4 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 0. 4 °C and 1 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. The use of a fan-coil heater increased the above mentioned differences to the level of about 1. 7 °C and 6 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 1 °C and 3 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used.

6000|$|For {{most of our}} uses it {{generally}} is so; and because we cannot use a rusty knife or razor so well as a polished one, we suppose {{it to be a}} great defect in iron that it is subject to rust. But not at all. On the contrary, the most perfect and useful state of it is that ochreous stain; and therefore it is endowed with so ready a disposition to get itself into that state. It is not a fault in the iron, but a virtue, to be so fond of getting rusted, for in that condition it fulfils its most important functions in the universe, and most kindly duties to mankind. Nay, in a certain sense, and almost a literal one, we may say that iron rusted is Living; but when pure or polished, Dead. You all probably know that in the <b>mixed</b> <b>air</b> we breathe, the part of it essentially needful to us is called oxygen; and that this substance is to all animals, in the most accurate sense of the word, [...] "breath of life." [...] The nervous power of life is a different thing; but the supporting element of the breath, without which the blood, and therefore the life, cannot be nourished, is this oxygen. Now it is this very same air which the iron breathes when it gets rusty. It takes the oxygen from the atmosphere as eagerly as we do, though it uses it differently. The iron keeps all that it gets; we, and other animals, part with it again; but the metal absolutely keeps what it has once received of this aerial gift; and the ochreous dust which we so much despise is, in fact, just so much nobler than pure iron, in so far as it is iron and the air. Nobler, and more useful--for, indeed, as I shall be able to show you presently--the main service of this metal, and of all other metals, to us, is not in making knives, and scissors, and pokers, and pans, but in making the ground we feed from, and nearly all the substances first needful to our existence. For these are all nothing but metals and oxygen--metals with breath put into them. Sand, lime, clay, {{and the rest of the}} earths--potash and soda, and the rest of the alkalies--are all of them metals which have undergone this, so to speak, vital change, and have been rendered fit for the service of man by permanent unity with the purest air which he himself breathes. There is only one metal which does not rust readily; and that, in its influence on Man hitherto, has caused Death rather than Life; it will not be put to its right use till it is made a pavement of, and so trodden under foot.|$|E
