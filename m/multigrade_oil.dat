50|$|By the time, Alexander Duckham died in 1945 (being succeeded as company {{chairman}} {{by his son}} Jack), Duckhams {{had assumed}} a dominant position in supply of lubricants and corrosion inhibitors to the motor industry and other markets. Behind Castrol, by 1967, it was regarded as the largest independent lubricating oil company in the UK and the third largest supplier of engine oil to motorists, producing the first <b>multigrade</b> <b>oil</b> for motorists. To cope with demand, a new manufacturing plant was opened in Aldridge, Staffordshire in 1968, shortly before the company was acquired by BP in 1969. Duckhams' Hammersmith site closed in 1979, was acquired by Richard Rogers' architects practice (today Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners) in 1983, and was redeveloped to become the Thames Wharf Studios and the River Café.|$|E

5000|$|A 1989 American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) report {{stated that}} its 12-year effort {{to come up}} with a new high-temperature, high-shear (HTHS) {{standard}} was not successful. Referring to SAE J300, the basis for current grading standards, the report stated:The rapid growth of non-Newtonian <b>multigraded</b> <b>oils</b> has rendered kinematic viscosity as a nearly useless parameter for characterising [...] "real" [...] viscosity in critical zones of an engine... There are those who are disappointed that the twelve-year effort has not resulted in a redefinition of the SAE J300 Engine Oil Viscosity Classification document so as to express high-temperature viscosity of the various grades ... In the view of this writer, this redefinition did not occur because the automotive lubricant market knows of no field failures unambiguously attributable to insufficient HTHS oil viscosity.|$|R

40|$|The {{lubrication}} {{process of}} mechanical equipment {{and treatment of}} assembly metals structures using fluids with efficient rheological properties requires a knowledge of their behavior in the presence {{and in the absence}} of organic impurities. The intrinsic physical property of the lubricating fluids has a dependency to the mechanical and physicochemical environment. This paper is focused on the assessment of the behavior of SAE 20 W 40 <b>multigrade</b> <b>oil</b> under normal temperature and pressure, through the addition of water in vapor phase and solid paraffin. Results show that there is a decrease in the dynamic and kinematic viscosity for heterogeneous oils. The rate of degradation is greater in the mixture of water with oil. The addition of paraffin in the mixture caused an increase in viscosity. However, after certain RPM points, it is noted that the data curve became similar to the first mixture. This relaxation phenomenon is caused by the turbulence created by the rotating cylinder in oil. The use of a retentate paraffin shows that the added agent has acted as a surfactan...|$|E
40|$|A {{compressible}} viscous isothermal {{model is}} presented for studying journal-bearing lubrication. The viscosity {{in the model}} thickens with increasing density. The governing equations are written in terms of velocity, the natural logarithm of the density and the kinematic extra-stress tensor. A semi-Làgrangian treatment of the material derivatives is combined with a spectral element discretization in space. The roles {{of the speed of}} sound and the eccentricity ratio on the load-bearing capacity of the journal bearing are investigated. Compressibility is shown to enhance the load-bearing capacity and this effect is amplified as the eccentricity ratio approaches unity. It is shown that for speeds of sound in the region of those of <b>multigrade</b> <b>oils,</b> the dominant component of the force on the journal acts along the line joining the centres of the bearing and journal and in the direction away from the narrow gap...|$|R
40|$|The high {{shearing}} stresses {{encountered in}} the modern engine bearing lubricant film lead to significant drop in viscosity of <b>multigrade</b> <b>oils</b> and affect the values of film thickness, power loss and oil flow significantly in the engine bearings. The popular mobility method is incapable to incorporate shear thinning, and time-consuming numerical schemes are not readily acceptable in industry. The present study aims to provide art economic (time and effort saving) and reliable dynamic (considering load and speed variation with crank rotation) analysis to study the combined effect of temperature and lubricant shear thinning on the engine bearing performance. The variation in the lubricant viscosity with shear is considered as described by the Gecim-equation. An effective thermal analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} operating oil-temperature that determines the low and high shear viscosity, and shear stability parameter: A crankshaft bearing is analyzed and results are presented for various performance parameters such as minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and the friction loss. These results are compared with those obtained by steady state solutions and full scale numerical methods...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays polymer {{containing}} oils are extensively used as <b>multigrade</b> <b>oils</b> for the lubrication {{of vehicle}} engines and gears. Based {{on the results}} of DGMK-project 466, the influences of the polymers' chemical structure and molecular weight, their concentration in the base oil and the base oil viscosity on the film forming capacity were investigated separately and systematically by means of film thickness measurements with a wide spectrum of polymer containing test oils. None of the investigated polymer containing oils was able to form as thick lubricant films, as was expected according to the usual Ubbelohde-viscosity, which is determined at standard conditions. Mainly a high molecular weight of the polymers as well as the ability of some polymers to form network structures proved to be detrimental to the film forming capacity. By taking into account the reversible and the irreversible viscosity loss after shearing, the accuracy of film thickness calculation could be improved for polymer containing oils. Altogether, a systematic, far reaching comprehension of the efficacy of various polymers in an EHL-contact could be gained. This helps the lubricant industry to judge current products and to improve the composition of new polymer containing lubricants. (orig.)

40|$|Polymer {{additives}} {{have become}} requisite for {{the formulation of}} <b>multigrade</b> engine <b>oils.</b> The behavior of polymethacrylate (PMA) -thickened oils as lubricants in concentrated contacts under nominal rolling and pure sliding conditions was investigated by conventional optical interferometry. The PMA thickened oils behaved differently from the base oil {{in the formation of}} elastohydrodynamic (EHL) films. The higher the elastohydrodynamic molecular weight of the PMA contained in the lubricant, the thinner was the oil film under EHL conditions. The film thickness of shear-degraded PMA-thickened oils was also investigated. The behavior of graphite particles dispersed in both the base oil and the PMA-thickened oil was studied under pure sliding by taking photomicrographs. Many kinds of additives are contained in lubricating oil and the interactions between additives are considered. The interactions of zinc-organodithiophosphates (ZDP) with other additives is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Polymer additives, named Viscosity Modifiers (VMs), {{have been}} added to motor engine {{lubricants}} for more than 50 years, where they are used to increase the viscosity index of their blends. It is well known that solutions of VMs exhibit shear thinning under high strain rate conditions as are present in engine journal bearings. In the past, this shear thinning was regarded as undesirable since it might reduce hydrodynamic film thickness. However {{it has been reported that}} <b>multigrade</b> <b>oils</b> containing VMs provide lower engine friction than polymer-free oils of comparable viscosity and the most likely origin of this is a reduction of hydrodynamic friction due to temporary shear thinning of the polymer solutions. In this thesis, the role of polymer shear thinning in reducing hydrodynamic friction is clarified by the experimental work carried out on a range of different polymer types. This study includes the viscosity measurements over a wide range of shear rate and also friction and film thickness analyses performed in a soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication contact in order to avoid piezoviscous effects. A very recent technique based on laser induced fluorescence technology is used to evaluate the film thickness. These experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations, which allows based on the rheological data of each polymer solution, the impact of polymer shear thinning on hydrodynamic friction to be quantified. The studied polymer solutions show a decrease in film thickness and in hydrodynamic friction compared to Newtonian fluids of similar viscosity. This reduction is ascribed to the temporary shear thinning of polymer blends. The proposed theoretical models show good agreement with the experimental values. They appear to be useful tools to quantify the impact of polymer shear thinning on film thickness and friction. In addition to this main work, the polymer solutions are analysed under high contact pressure and the shear stability of some commercials viscosity modifiers are studied. A new method is developed to quantify the permanent viscosity loss of each polymer solution and this is compared to the industrial Kurt-Orbahn test.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the experimental modelling of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids transport in partially saturated with water sand using centrifuge tests, which {{were carried out}} at the Geotechnical Centrifuge facility located at Delft Technical University (The Netherlands). The experimentation consisted of a two-dimensional three-phase flow (air, water, Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids) in an unsaturated sand for two values of porosity. The Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids used in this research was a <b>multigrade</b> motor <b>oil.</b> The modelling of a two-dimensional flow {{and the use of}} a transparent strongbox enabled the direct observations of the experiments. Scaling laws developed in connection with other studies available in the literature were used. Tests were conducted at two different gravity accelerations, 20 g and 30 g, in order to verify, by means of the "modelling of models " technique, the similitude between the different experiments.

40|$|Abstract. In present study, a gear {{transmission}} system {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of oil viscosity, speed, oil temperature as well as the applied load on torque efficiency. The experimental results reveal that the efficiency is increased with the increasing oil temperature and/or applied load whether the <b>multigrade</b> or singlegrade <b>oil</b> was employed. Under a constant torgue, the power loss is increased with the increasing pitch line velocity. The above characteristic resulting from the use of high-viscosity oil yields the substantial variations. However, as the oil film thickness is quite small, the viscosity speed, oil temperature and applied load produces the limited effect on torque efficiency, It indicate that EP additives create an opposite effect on torque efficiency at poor lubrication...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} thermal {{properties}} of selected biooils (Plahyd S – biooil No 1 and Plahyd N – biooil No 2) and rheologic properties of rapeseed oil. Plahyd S is a synthetic, rapidly biodegradable fluid {{which is based}} on sustainable raw materials. It is exceptionally suitable for applications in mobile and stationary hydraulic systems. Plahyd N is <b>multigrade</b> hydraulic <b>oil</b> based on rapeseed oil used in agricultural and construction machinery. For thermal parameters measurements was used Hot wire method. The experiment is based on measuring of the temperature rise vs. time evaluation of an electrically heated wire embedded in the tested material. The thermal conductivity is derived from the resulting change in temperature over a known time interval. Dependency of material resistance against the probe rotation was used at measurement of rheologic properties with instrument viscometer Anton Paar DV- 3 P. For two samples of biooils – Plahyd N and Plahyd S were determined basic thermophysical parameters – thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and volume specific heat. For each biooil samples were made two series of measurements. In the first series were measured thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at constant room temperature 20 °C. Every thermophysical parameter was measured 10 times for each sample. The results were statistically processed. For biooil No 1 thermal conductivity was 0. 325 W*m - 1. K- 1, it was higher value than we obtained for biooil No 2 – 0. 224 W*m - 1. K- 1. The similar results were obtained for thermal diffusivity of biooil No 1 2. 140. 10 - 7 m 2 *s - 1 and biooil No 2 2. 604. 10 - 7 m 2 * s - 1. For samples with constant temperature were calculated basic statistical characteristics as: standard deviation for ? – biooil No 1 (± 0. 056 W*m - 1 *K - 1) and biooil No 2 (± 0. 054 W*m - 1 *K - 1); probable error of the arithmetic average for ? – biooil No 1 (± 0. 012 W*m - 1 *K - 1) and biooil No 2 (± 0. 005 W*m - 1 *K - 1); relative probable error in % for ? – biooil No 1 (± 3. 69 %) and biooil No 2 (± 2. 23 %). The same statistical characteristics were calculated for thermal diffusivity. In the second series of measurements were measured relations of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity to the temperature in temperature range (20 – 29) °C. From results was evident that all measured dependencies are nonlinear. For both thermophysical parameters were obtained polynomial functions of the second degree described by the polynomial coefficients. Type of function was selected according to statistical evaluation based on the coefficient of determination for every thermophysical parameter graphical dependency. In temperature dependency of rapeseed oil dynamic viscosity was used decreasing exponential function, which is in accordance with Arrhenius equation. The results obtained by the implementation of thermophysical and rheologic measurements on samples of biooils could be compared with the values presented in the literature...|$|R
