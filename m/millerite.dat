In New York alone, in the five-month period ending April 1843, 600,000 copies of various publications were distributed. In December 1843, Himes proposed the publication of one million tracts, while in May 1844, he announced that five million copies of <b>Millerite</b> publications had been distributed up to that time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Millerites</b> {{were the}} most {{well-known}} family of the Adventist movements. They emphasized apocalyptic teachings anticipating {{the end of the}} world, and did not look for the unity of Christendom but busied themselves in preparation for Christ's return. <b>Millerites</b> sought to restore a prophetic immediacy and uncompromising biblicism that they believed had once existed but had long been rejected by mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches.

25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist Church {{developed}} from the <b>Millerite</b> movement of the 1830s and 1840s. William Miller traveled in response to invitations. This {{led him to the}} Eastern Townships of Quebec. Miller, Joshua Himes, and Josiah Litch all visited Canada. Miller's sister lived in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Josiah Litch lived in that district and led in <b>Millerite</b> activities there. Canada became an integral part of their activities. The interest in Miller's teachings was extensive in the Canadas and the Maritimes. Under the leadership of Josiah Litch, the first <b>Millerite</b> camp meeting took place in Canada, at Hatley, Quebec.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} the {{instances}} of violence: a <b>Millerite</b> church was burned in Ithaca, and two were vandalized in Dansville and Scottsville.

25|$|After the {{disappointment}} of October 22, 1844, <b>Millerites</b> developed into several divergent groups. The Sabbatarian {{group led by}} the Whites, Joseph Bates and others sought out the scattered <b>Millerites</b> and presented their Sabbath understanding to them. In the early 1850s Joseph Bates and Hiram Edson traveled along the northern shore of Lake Ontario trudging through knee-deep snow seeking out the <b>Millerites.</b> Thirty years later, the Adventist presence in Canada was still in its nascent stage. The first Seventh-day Adventist church in Canada was at South Stukely, Quebec. It organized on September 30, 1877, with 16 members.|$|R
25|$|As well as {{utilizing}} imported American literature, two <b>Millerite</b> {{papers were}} published locally in Great Britain: the Second Advent Harbinger in Bristol, and the British Midnight Cry in Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>Millerite</b> Adventists {{lived in}} the Eastern Townships north of Vermont. Then, as the Sabbatarian Adventists visited these people, some joined in the observing of the Seventh-day Sabbath. The first Canadian Seventh-day Adventist church and school started in this area.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} manner, {{converts}} {{were made in}} Norway and Chile. A letter published in The Midnight Cry of October 12, 1843, from a Mrs O. S.

25|$|Channing's arrival renewed Blackwell's {{interests}} {{in education and}} reform. She worked at intellectual self-improvement: studying art, attending various lectures, writing short stories and attending various religious services in all denominations (Quaker, <b>Millerite,</b> Jewish). In the early 1840s, she began to articulate thoughts about women's rights in her diaries and letters, and participated in the Harrison political campaign of 1840.|$|E
25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist Church {{grew out}} of the Adventist movement, in {{particular}} the Millerites. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest of several Adventist groups which arose from the <b>Millerite</b> movement of the 1840s in upstate New York, a phase of the Second Great Awakening. Important to the Seventh-day Adventist movement is a belief in progressive revelation, teaching that the Christian life and testimony is intended to be typified by the Spirit of Prophecy, as explained in the writings of Ellen G. White.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of Miller's followers—the Millerites—vary between 50,000, and 500,000. Miller's legacy {{includes}} the Advent Christian Church with 61,000 members, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church with over 19 million members. Both these denominations {{have a direct}} connection with the <b>Millerites</b> and the Great Disappointment of 1844. A number of other individuals with ties to the <b>Millerites</b> founded various short-lived groups. These include Clorinda S. Minor, who led a group of seven to Palestine to prepare for Christ's second coming at a later date.|$|R

25|$|Limestone and {{dolomite}} of the Mississippian epoch {{underlie the}} area, {{and parts of}} the city are karst in nature. This is particularly true of the area south of downtown, which has numerous sinkholes and caves. Most of the caves in the city have been sealed, but many springs are visible along the riverfront. Coal, brick clay, and <b>millerite</b> ore were once mined in the city. The predominant surface rock, known as St. Louis limestone, is used as dimension stone and rubble for construction.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, at age 12, {{her family}} became {{involved}} with the <b>Millerite</b> movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she felt guilty for her sins, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer, and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.|$|E
25|$|While {{it seems}} then, {{that the vast}} {{majority}} of Miller’s followers were of local origin, his message was not limited to his local area—nor even to the United States. Miller preached across the border in Canada’s Eastern Townships on at least three occasions: in 1835, 1838 and 1840. He made a number of converts there and gained the support of some of the local clergy. At least five <b>Millerite</b> papers were published in Canada: the Faithful Watchman—published in Sherbrooke from January 1843; the influential Voice of Elijah, published in Montreal from June 1843; the short-lived Hope of the Church in St. Thomas in 1844; Behold, He Cometh in Hamilton, and the Bridegroom’s Herald in Toronto, both from mid-1844.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group that}} {{added to the}} ranks of the White Water Shakers were {{followers}} of William Miller. He predicted the exact moment in April 1843 for Christ's Second Coming. People wound up their earthly affairs, dressed in ascension robes, and waited. Miller set another date six months later, but that final judgment day passed, too. His disappointed followers, the <b>Millerites</b> or Second Adventists, were courted by the Shakers who convinced the <b>Millerites</b> that the Shakers had already experienced the Second Coming in a spiritual sense.|$|R

2500|$|Periodical {{literature}} {{played an}} important part in the rapid and widespread dissemination of <b>Millerite</b> beliefs. [...] "From first to last the power of the press, in this particular form, was one of the foremost factors in the success of this now vigorous, expanding movement." [...] In addition to the Signs of the Times based in Boston, <b>Millerite</b> papers were published in numerous cities including New York, Philadelphia, Rochester, Cleveland, and Montreal. There were at least 48 <b>Millerite</b> periodicals that circulated in the period leading up to the Great Disappointment. The majority of these, however, were quite short-lived—often a new paper was started whenever a <b>Millerite</b> evangelistic campaign entered a new area.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-1845, doctrinal lines {{amongst the}} various <b>Millerite</b> groups began to solidify, {{emphasizing}} their differences—a process Knight terms [...] "sect building." [...] During this time three main <b>Millerite</b> groups formed, {{in addition to}} those who had simply given up their beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} {{division}} of the <b>Millerite</b> groups who retained a belief in Christ's Second Advent were those who focused on the [...] "shut-door" [...] belief.

5000|$|The name {{refers to}} {{belief in the}} {{imminent}} Second Coming (or [...] "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ. William Miller started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as <b>Millerites.</b>|$|R
