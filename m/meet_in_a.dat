5|$|Most Lodges {{have some}} sort of social calendar, {{allowing}} Masons and their partners to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less ritualised environment. Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. This occurs at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many field, such as education or disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|There {{are among}} other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely {{alongside}} one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way– differently and randomly for each performance– until they <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

5|$|On New Year's Eve, Lydia discovers Zoe's true {{reasons for}} befriending her {{and decides to}} murder her at Sarah's grave, before taking her own life. Zoe and Lydia <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> church to admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. However, Zoe flees and is knocked unconscious. When she wakes up, she finally gets a {{confession}} from Lydia, who admits why she cut the parachute. Zoe attacks Lydia before leaving. At Sarah's grave, Lydia stabs Zoe, as Charlotte, Mike and Dave arrive to stop her. As Zoe is taken away in an ambulance, Lydia is arrested. Lydia is questioned by D.I. Fletcher (Laura Fletcher) as Zoe recovers in hospital. Lydia admits everything and she is then charged {{for the murder of}} Sarah and attempted murder of Zoe. She is later given a lifetime prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate to turn over his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find. Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing {{to turn over the}} records. The Old Court continued to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky loomed.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 tournament {{became an}} {{exceptional}} show as many teams such as América de Cali, River Plate, Grêmio, Cobreloa, and Racing, among others, brought their best sides in generations and unexpected teams such as Independiente Medellín and Paysandu became revelations in what was, arguably, the best Copa Libertadores in history. The biggest {{news of the}} competition was previous champion Santos. Qualifying to the tournament as Brazilian champion, coached by Emerson Leão and containing marvelous figures such as Renato, Alex, Léo, Ricardo Oliveira, Diego, Robinho, and Elano, the Santásticos {{became a symbol of}} entertaining and cheerful football that resembled Pelé's generation of the 1960s. Boca Juniors once again found talent in their ranks to fill the gap left by the very successful group of 2000–2001 (with upcoming stars Rolando Schiavi, Roberto Abbondanzieri and Carlos Tevez). Boca Juniors and Santos would eventually <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rematch of the 1963 final; Boca avenged the 1963 loss by defeating Santos in both legs of the final. Carlos Bianchi won the Cup for a fourth time and became the most successful manager in the competition's history and Boca Juniors hailed themselves pentacampeones. Boca reached their fourth final in five tournaments in 2004 but were beaten by surprise-outfit Once Caldas of Colombia, ending Boca's dream generation. Once Caldas, employing a conservative and defensive style of football, became the second Colombian side to win the competition.|$|E
5|$|They made {{subsequent}} appearances for JAPW in 2002, first {{losing to}} The S.A.T. on May 3 at May Madness. They then re-entered the JAPW Tag Team Championship picture, wrestling in a three-team match against Da Hit Squad and Wasted Youth, {{the team of}} Insane Dragon & Deranged, to fill the vacant championship at Unfinished Business on July 13, 2002. It was Jay and Insane Dragon, however, who emerged as champions, after scoring simultaneous pinfalls on the members of Da Hit Squad. The six men went on to <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rematch of sorts at the next event, Royal Consequences 2 on August 10. Jay and Dragon defended the title against Da Hit Squad and the team of Mark and Deranged in a tables, ladders, and chairs match, which Da Hit Squad won. Two shows later, on September 20 at Family Crisis 2, Da Hit Squad successfully retained the title over the Briscoes in a regular match.|$|E
