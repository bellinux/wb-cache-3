5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game was an easy win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A, was not much more difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points would end up being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not <b>mean</b> <b>much,</b> as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.|$|E

25|$|In the {{big picture}} the fight would not <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> - Denmark had already lost the war, and a {{possible}} victory would hardly have altered this. Generally {{it is said that}} an attacker at the start should have a strength superiority on a factor of three; Here were the Danes not even twice so many as the defending. But yet different causes come from analysing supplementary causes of the Danish defeat.|$|E

25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Originally Defiance was {{supposed}} to be released as an expansion pack, but Infogrames decided they would prefer a special edition that would have both the new campaign and the original game in the same box. This special edition was released in the US as Independence War Deluxe Edition in 1999. The European version was released the same year, but was called Independence War Special Edition instead since it was reasoned that 'deluxe' doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> to the French or German audiences. The American version also included a $10 rebate for owners of Independence War, but no rebate was included with the European version.|$|E

500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{reviewed}} the show. He felt differently from both Keller and Kapur, as he stated that Bound for Glory overall was a [...] "bad PPV." [...] He believed the main event was a [...] "cluster," [...] the Gauntlet match was [...] "pointless," [...] and the Monster's Ball match was the [...] "same ole' carwreck match with no long-term selling and too many highspots that didn't <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> {{at the end of}} the day." [...] He called the NWA World Tag Team Championship match [...] "ridiculous" [...] and the TNA X Division Champion number-one contender the [...] "worst Ultimate X match in TNA history." [...] He did, however, praise the Iron Man match stating it was [...] "definitely the match of the night with some good wrestling holds and believable nearfalls." [...] He also enjoyed the Liger versus Joe bout, say it was a [...] "good start to the show even if it was shorter than expected." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver David Coulthard, Nico Rosberg expressed excitement {{over how the}} end of the season had worked out for him, describing the race in the United States as his [...] "low point". Speaking about racing his teammate Hamilton, he called him [...] "one of the best out there" [...] and said that it was [...] "an even better feeling to win, definitely against such opposition". Hamilton in turn praised his team for their performance over the whole season, saying that they had [...] "surpassed their own expectations", albeit confessing that he was happy that the season was over. During the press conference, third-placed Kimi Räikkönen said: [...] "It’s never nice to finish third but I’ll take it after previous races", pointing to a season that had been marred with small mistakes and misfortunes for him. He also stated that securing fourth place in the World Championship did not <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> to him, dismissing the idea of a [...] "Finnish championship" [...] between himself and Valtteri Bottas.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{subcategory}} {{of this is}} {{the peace}} offering (Hebrew: Zevaḥ shelamim).

500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>much.</b> So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who {{would have loved to have}} been a genuine eccentric".|$|E
500|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 0–1 record, having lost to the Reds, who were 1–0 the day before. As Hershiser {{prepared}} for his first start, he said that the continuation of the streak via the asterisk did not <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> to him and that in his mind the streak was already over. His mound opponent was Tom Browning who had pitched a perfect game {{the last time he had}} faced the Dodgers (September 16, 1988). Todd Benzinger drove in Larkin to end Hershiser's streak in the first inning and Hershiser was tagged with his first loss since August 24. The Dodgers endured three errors and a passed ball in the game. Leadoff hitter Larkin chopped a groundball over Hershiser into centerfield. Hershiser's pick off throw hit Larkin's armpit. After Hershiser retired Chris Sabo and Eric Davis via strikeout, he walked Kal Daniels, who had a career [...]500 batting average and four home runs against Hershiser, on four pitches. Then Benzinger, with whom Hershiser was unfamiliar, singled through the right side of the Dodger infield to score Larkin thus ending Hershiser's streak. Howell did not allow an earned run in his second 1989 outing on April 10. Thus, Howell's streak went from August 11, 1988, through April 9, 1989.|$|E

500|$|Although forty-five {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Travis Kvapil clinched the first pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 51.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Mears in his best qualifying performance of the season. Aric Almirola qualified third, his Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teammate Regan Smith was fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier. After the qualifier Kvapil said, [...] "Definitely qualifying doesn't really <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> as far as your chances to win the race after 500 miles, but we got a good pit selection and we'll have less chance {{to get caught up in}} a wreck early on in the race. It doesn't take long to get shuffled to the back and I'm sure I'll be shuffled in and out throughout the field. But the first few laps we'll be up front and hopefully keeping it clean." [...] He also stated the pole was [...] "special", and this was the first time Ford had occupied that position at Talladega Superspeedway since 1997.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In {{his review of}} The Open Door, Ed Thompson of the website IGN, stated that the fans who were [...] "looking for the full-blown piano ballad" [...] reminiscent of [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2004) {{had to wait until}} the album's final track. He added {{that at the end of}} the album they were awarded with [...] "not only the most beautiful song on the album, but also the most unique song Lee has ever released." [...] He further said, [...] "despite Lee's voice giving the tune a funereal cast, there is no hiding the fact that the lyrics are of an upbeat nature. 'Shouldn't have to torture me so sweetly, now I can't let go of this dream, I can't breathe but I feel good enough, I feel good enough for you.'" [...] Bill Lamb of the website About.com, put the song in his list of Top Tracks from The Open Door along with [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", [...] "Call Me When You're Sober", [...] "Your Star" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa". Jon Dolan from Entertainment Weekly said that [...] " [...] the deceptively soft 'Good Enough' flirts again with the dark side, offering 'Drink up sweet decadence / I can't say no to you' and striking a final note of cathartic badness." [...] Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Lee's [...] "newfound confidence" [...] is evident in the song. In his review of The Open Door, Andree Farias of Christianity Today concluded that though the song [...] "leaves a sweet taste in your mouth", it may not <b>mean</b> <b>much</b> in [...] "a scheme." [...] He added that the song stands as a contrast to everything else in the album.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Thomas Sutcliffe for The Independent writes that: [...] "while flight is the sustaining theme, the film never soars. The characterisation is Cluedo with pretensions, and the dialogue suspends the actors in that ungainly, undignified dangle which you associate with stage flying, the wires robbing them of all powers of independent movement." [...] While {{he describes the}} scene which culminates the lesbian storyline as [...] "radiant" [...] and [...] "beautifully acted by Vanessa Redgrave and Dorothy Tutin", he opines of the acting in general that [...] "for the most part, these people are simply Winterson's puppets, jerked around by the symbolic demands of the plot." [...] He deems Kidron's directing [...] "a kind of surrender, dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson's sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity", and is particularly critical of Winterson's screenplay, noting that: [...] "everything unrolls at the same stately pace, a religious procession bearing the reliquaries of Winterson's prose. It's as though the author thinks every word is infinitely precious. She's right, though perhaps {{not in the way}} she imagines." [...] Variety′s David Rooney agrees the film's coming-out scene is a [...] "potential jewel" [...] and [...] "captivatingly played", however, in line with Sutcliffe's criticisms, opines that the film's pacing means that [...] "the scene is lobbed in and robbed of its impact". He summarises the film as [...] "a willfully theatrical, sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible narrative strands, not one of which ever gets full flight clearance". Rooney deems the film [...] "Damaged beyond repair by a mannered scripting style and evident recutting", and opines that [...] "Jeanette Winterson's preposterous dialogue and comic mistiming serves up more misses than hits". Of the film's major themes, he writes that: [...] "Questions about the line between truth and falsehood, genuine and fake, are too flimsily voiced to <b>mean</b> <b>much.</b> Likewise, the intro of race issues in the closing voiceover only makes the haphazard mix even more lumpy".|$|E
