25|$|<b>Multipotent</b> {{stem cells}} are also found in amniotic fluid. These {{stem cells are}} very active, expand {{extensively}} without feeders and are not tumorigenic. Amniotic stem cells are <b>multipotent</b> and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multipotent</b> {{stem cells}} {{have also been}} derived from germ cells found in human testicles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multipotent</b> {{stem cells}} can {{differentiate}} {{into a number}} of cell types, but only those of a closely related family of cells.|$|E
25|$|Protoplasmic: {{found in}} grey matter and have many {{branching}} processes whose end-feet envelop synapses. Some protoplasmic astrocytes are generated by <b>multipotent</b> subventricular zone progenitor cells.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} have {{limitations}} with their potency; unlike ESCs, {{they are not}} able to differentiate into cells from all three germ layers. As such, they are deemed <b>multipotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fetal proper {{stem cells}} {{come from the}} tissue of the fetus proper, and are {{generally}} obtained after an abortion. These stem cells are not immortal but have {{a high level of}} division and are <b>multipotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endothelial {{stem cells}} {{are one of the}} three types of <b>multipotent</b> stem cells found in the bone marrow. They are a rare and {{controversial}} group with the ability to differentiate into endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hair}} follicle, stemcells reside in a {{discrete}} microenvironment called the bulge, {{located at the}} base of the part of the follicle that is established during morphogenesis but does not degenerate during the hair cycle. The bulge contains <b>multipotent</b> stemcells that can be recruited during wound healing to help the repair of the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|White {{blood cells}} (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are {{the cells of}} the immune system that are {{involved}} in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from <b>multipotent</b> cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.|$|E
25|$|Potency: the {{capacity}} to differentiate into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either totipotent or pluripotent—to {{be able to give}} rise to any mature cell type, although <b>multipotent</b> or unipotent progenitor cells are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.|$|E
25|$|B {{cells and}} T cells {{are derived from}} the same <b>multipotent</b> hematopoietic stem cells, and are morphologically indistinguishable from one another until after they are activated. B cells play {{a large role in}} the humoral immune response, whereas T cells are intimately {{involved}} in cell-mediated immune responses. In all vertebrates except Agnatha, B cells and T cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|In Drosophila, proneural {{genes are}} first {{expressed}} in quiescent ectodermal cells that have both epidermal and neuronal potential. Proneural activity {{results in the}} selection of progenitors that are committed to a neural fate but remain <b>multipotent,</b> with sense organ progenitors giving rise to neurons, glia and other non-neuronal cell types. Additionally, some neuroblasts of the central nervous system also generate both neurons and glia. Progenitors of the peripheral and central nervous system only begin to divide after proneural gene expression has subsided.|$|E
25|$|Erythropoietin is {{the primary}} erythropoietic factor that cooperates with various other growth factors (e.g., IL-3, IL-6, glucocorticoids, and SCF) {{involved}} {{in the development of}} erythroid lineage from <b>multipotent</b> progenitors. The burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells start erythropoietin receptor expression and are sensitive to erythropoietin. Subsequent stage, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), expresses maximal erythropoietin receptor density and is completely dependent on erythropoietin for further differentiation. Precursors of red cells, the proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts also express erythropoietin receptor and are therefore affected by it.|$|E
25|$|When and how <b>multipotent</b> {{chromatophore}} {{precursor cells}} (called chromatoblasts) develop into their daughter subtypes {{is an area}} of ongoing research. It is known in zebrafish embryos, for example, that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish—melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores—are already present. Studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit, sox10, and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation. If these proteins are defective, chromatophores may be regionally or entirely absent, resulting in a leucistic disorder.|$|E
25|$|All {{white blood}} cells (WBCs) are known as leukocytes. Leukocytes differ from other cells {{of the body in}} that they are not tightly {{associated}} with a particular organ or tissue; thus, their function {{is similar to that of}} independent, single-cell organisms. Leukocytes are able to move freely and interact with and capture cellular debris, foreign particles, and invading microorganisms. Unlike many other cells in the body, most innate immune leukocytes cannot divide or reproduce on their own, but are the products of <b>multipotent</b> hematopoietic stem cells present in the bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{classical}} αβ T cells (their {{development of}} which is outlined above), {{a number of other}} T lineages develop in the thymus, including γδ T cells and Natural Killer T (NKT)cells. Additionally, other non-T hematopoietic lineages can develop in the thymus, including B lymphocytes (B cells), Natural Killer lymphocytes (NK cells).), myeloid cells, and dendritic cells. However, the thymus is not a source of B, NK, or myeloid development. The development of these cells in the thymus reflects the <b>multipotent</b> nature of hematopoitic prognitors that seed the thymus.|$|E
25|$|Sox family: The Sox {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors {{is associated with}} maintaining pluripotency similar to Oct-3/4, although it is associated with <b>multipotent</b> and unipotent stem cells in contrast with Oct-3/4, which is exclusively expressed in pluripotent stem cells. While Sox2 was the initial gene used for induction by Yamanaka et al., Jaenisch et al., and Thomson et al., other transcription factors in the Sox family {{have been found to}} work as well in the induction process. Sox1 yields iPS cells with a similar efficiency as Sox2, and genes Sox3, Sox15, and Sox18 also generate iPS cells, although with decreased efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Autologous stem-cell {{transplantation}} using mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{has been used}} to improve recovery time from ACL surgery, especially for athletes. MSCs are <b>multipotent</b> stem cells, meaning they can differentiate into multiple cell types. In the case of mesenchymal stem cells, these cell types include osteoblasts (bone cells), adipocytes (fat cells), and chondrocytes (cartilage cells). Ligament tissue mainly consists of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. Ligament cells differ in size, respond to different cues in the cell environment, and express different cell surface markers, limiting the number of clinical treatments for accelerated repair of ACL tissue to MSCs and primary fibroblasts obtained from other ACL tissue. Therefore, most modern stem cell injections use MSCs to promote faster repair of the ACL and allow people such as athletes to return to their previous form faster.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be unipotent, <b>multipotent,</b> or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively. Pluripotent stem cells can become cells derived {{from any of the}} three embryonic germ layers. Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner. Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of <b>multipotent</b> stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation {{is a large}} obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system. EMSCs are <b>multipotent</b> and possess a self-renewing capacity. They {{can be thought of}} as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with dorsal root ganglion and motor nerve development. EMSC differentiation appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment. Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and neurotrophic factors essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines GDNF, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating MAP kinases. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. Myelinated axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.|$|E
25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from <b>multipotent</b> stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
500|$|While at the NINDS, Fischbach {{researched}} {{the effects of}} neuregulin, which is a family of proteins including heregulin, neu differentiation factor, ARIA, and glial growth factor that are critical for vertebrate embryogenesis and specifically {{for the formation of}} vertebrate spinal cord oligodendrocytes. [...] Fischbach and his colleagues noticed that oligodendrocytes failed to form in mice that were homozygous for the mutant neuregulin gene. [...] However, when wild-type neuregulin was added to homozygous mutant neuregulin explants (isolated tissue cell cultures) nine days after conception of the embryos, normal oligodendrocyte development occurred. This indicated that neuregulin is not necessary for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte <b>multipotent</b> precursor cells. [...] Additionally, when IgB4, a neuregulin inhibitor, is added to wild-type explants, oligodendrocyte development failed to occur.|$|E
500|$|Astrocytes form gap {{junctions}} and {{are closely}} associated with the vasculature and its basal lamina in the adult SVZ and subsequently in the RMS. They may serve as an interface to modulate influences of endothelial and circulation-derived factors as well as the availability of cytokines and growth factors in this system. In addition, astrocytes derived from the neurogenic hippocampus and SVZ, but not from the non-neurogenic spinal cord, promote proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of <b>multipotent</b> adult neural stem cells in culture, suggesting a role in the RMS. Astrocytes express a number of secreted and membrane-attached factors both in vitro and in vivo that are known to regulate proliferation and fate specification of adult neural precursors as well as neuronal migration, maturation, and synapse formation. In the adult SVZ, astrocytes express Robo receptors and regulate the rapid migration of SLIT1-expressing neuroblasts through the RMS. Additionally, it has been proposed that the neuroblasts themselves play a role in modulating the astrocytes through Slit-Robo interactions. In the absence of Slit, astrocytic processes do not align correctly, or create the [...] "tubes", instead running across the migrating neurons. Adult SVZ astrocytes also appear to release glutamate to regulate the survival of neuroblasts. Unique to the adult SVZ, ependymal cells lining the ventricular wall are in close association with neural precursors and their progeny, acting like a shield to protect the [...] "neurogenic niche", a zone in which stem cells are retained after embryonic development for the production of new cells of the nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{key player}} of {{differentiation}} from HSC to a <b>multipotent</b> progenitor (MPP) is transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). Mutations in C/EBPα {{are associated with}} acute myeloid leukaemia. [...] From this point, cells can either differentiate along the Erythroid-megakaryocyte lineage or lymphoid and myeloid lineage, which have common progenitor, called lymphoid-primed <b>multipotent</b> progenitor. There are two main transcription factors. PU.1 for Erythroid-megakaryocyte lineage and GATA-1, {{which leads to a}} lymphoid-primed <b>multipotent</b> progenitor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{molecular}} {{cascade of}} events {{is involved in}} establishing the migratory and <b>multipotent</b> characteristics of neural crest cells. [...] This gene-regulatory network can be subdivided into the following four sub-networks described below.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is the transplantation of <b>multipotent</b> hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It may be autologous (the patient's own {{stem cells are}} used), allogeneic (the stem cells come from a donor) or syngeneic (from an identical twin).|$|E
2500|$|... fully {{differentiated}} cell undergoes mutations or extracellular signals that drive {{it back to}} a stem-like state. This concept has been demonstrated most recently in Prostate cancer models, whereby cells undergoing androgen deprivation therapy appear to transiently alter their transcriptome {{to that of a}} neural crest stem-like cell, with the invasive and <b>multipotent</b> properties of this class of stem-like cells.|$|E
2500|$|Embryonic cord-blood {{cells were}} induced into {{pluripotent}} stem cells using plasmid DNA. [...] Using cell surface endothelial/pericytic markers CD31 and CD146, researchers identified 'vascular progenitor', the high-quality, <b>multipotent</b> vascular stem cells. [...] After the iPS cells were injected directly into the vitreous of the damaged retina of mice, the stem cells engrafted into the retina, grew and repaired the vascular vessels.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Multipotent</b> {{stem cells}} with a claimed {{equivalency}} to {{embryonic stem cells}} have been derived from spermatogonial progenitor cells found in the [...] testicles of laboratory mice by scientists in Germany and the United States, and, a year later, researchers from Germany and the United Kingdom confirmed the same capability using cells from the testicles of humans. [...] The extracted stem cells are known as human adult germline stem cells (GSCs) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{histogenesis}} of most lung cancers is {{not well}} understood. Carcinomas of the lung are thought to arise from the uncontrolled growth of mutated, transformed, <b>multipotent</b> [...] "cancer stem cells" [...] with epithelial characteristics or lineage. When viewed under a light microscope, the transformed cancer cells in LCLC are undifferentiated, lacking specific cytological and tissue architectural characteristics of other types, subtypes, and variants of lung cancer. Election microscopic studies, however, have shown that many LCLC do have ultrastructural characteristics of other tumor types (i.e. adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma)., and that rhabdoid carcinomas often show similar features.|$|E
2500|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{undifferentiated}} cells {{with the ability}} to divide in culture and give rise to different forms of specialized cells. According to their source stem cells are divided into [...] "adult" [...] and [...] "embryonic" [...] stem cells, the first class being <b>multipotent</b> and the latter mostly pluripotent; some cells are totipotent, in the earliest stages of the embryo. While there is still a large ethical debate related with the use of embryonic stem cells, it is thought that another alternative source - induced stem cells may be useful for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues, or may be used to grow new organs.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{adult stem}} cells are lineage-restricted (<b>multipotent)</b> and are {{generally}} referred to by their tissue origin (mesenchymal stem cell, adipose-derived stem cell, endothelial stem cell, dental pulp stem cell, etc.). [...] Muse cells (multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a recently discovered pluripotent stem cell type found in multiple adult tissues, including adipose, dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow. While rare, muse cells are identifiable by their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD105. When subjected to single cell suspension culture, the cells will generate clusters {{that are similar to}} embryoid bodies in morphology as well as gene expression, including canonical pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog.|$|E
2500|$|Pluripotent stem cells, i.e. {{cells that}} can give rise to any fetal or adult cell type, {{can be found in}} a number of tissues, {{including}} umbilical cord blood. Using genetic reprogramming, pluripotent stem cells equivalent to embryonic stem cells have been derived from human adult skin tissue. Other adult stem cells are <b>multipotent,</b> meaning they are restricted in the types of cell they can become, and are generally referred to by their tissue origin (such as mesenchymal stem cell, adipose-derived stem cell, endothelial stem cell, etc.). A great deal of adult stem cell research has focused on investigating their capacity to divide or self-renew indefinitely, and their potential for differentiation. [...] In mice, pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from adult fibroblast cultures.|$|E
2500|$|MDS {{is thought}} to arise from {{mutations}} in the <b>multipotent</b> bone marrow stem cell, but the specific defects responsible for these diseases remain poorly understood. Differentiation of blood precursor cells is impaired, and [...] {{a significant increase in}} levels of apoptotic cell death occurs in bone marrow cells. Clonal expansion of the abnormal cells results in the production of cells which have lost the ability to differentiate. If the overall percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts rises over a particular cutoff (20% for WHO and 30% for FAB), then transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is said to have occurred. The progression of MDS to AML {{is a good example of}} the multistep theory of carcinogenesis in which a series of mutations occurs in an initially normal cell and transforms it into a cancer cell.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} and histogenesis {{of lung cancer}}s are topics of intense interest and research. It is currently thought that most cases of lung cancer probably occur after damage to genomic DNA causes malignant transformation of a single <b>multipotent</b> cell. This newly formed entity, {{sometimes referred to as}} a cancer stem cell, then begins to divide uncontrollably, giving rise to new daughter cancer cells in an exponential (or near exponential) fashion. Unless this runaway cell division process is checked, a clinically apparent tumor will eventually form as the mass reaches sufficient size to be detected clinically, or begins to cause [...] signs or symptoms. Approximately 98% of lung cancers are eventually diagnosed as a histological variant of carcinoma, a term that signifies that the tumor derives from transformed epithelial cells, or cells that have acquired epithelial characteristics as a result of cell differentiation.|$|E
