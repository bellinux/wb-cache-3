5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> collected, with each set covering {{slightly more than half}} a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell becomes {{increasingly}} arrogant and hostile toward {{the rest of}} the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, enforcing his desires with fearsome displays of telepathic and telekinetic power. Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) comes to believe that Valiant crew members may have experienced the same phenomenon, and destroyed the ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E

5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to {{appreciate}} the fact that Bapaume <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directly attacked, Russell, encouraged by Harper, the commander of IV Corps, began drawing up plans to do so on 29 August, using the 1st Wellington Battalion, of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, it was still hoped that the Germans would withdraw on their own initiative. The bombardment on Bapaume continued into 28 August while 1st Infantry Brigade moved in close to the town on its southern frontage. Particularly heavy barrages were made during the evening and it was noted that the German response was relatively muted and by early in the morning of 29 August, there was no gun fire coming from Bapaume. Overnight, Bapaume had been abandoned, a state of affairs confirmed by patrols of the 3rd Rifle Battalion entering the town from the north. They observed retreating Germans making for Bancourt, to the east. Meanwhile, 2nd Auckland Battalion entered Bapaume from the south. Likewise, the Germans had retreated from Thilloy and the 5th Manchester Battalion, of 42nd Division, moved through the village and secured it.|$|E
5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel clouds were sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was nationally televised on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz was told that the game <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts impinged on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

The final product of the planning process may be formally documented or, {{in the case of}} recreational divers, an agreement on how the dive will be conducted. A diving project may consist of a number of related diving operations.|$|E

25|$|The 1961 {{series was}} a {{personal}} triumph for skipper Richie Benaud, whose match-winning bowling and astute leadership in the fourth Test at Old Trafford proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the decisive factor in the series. With the series square, England needed 256 <b>to</b> win and <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> get them, but Benaud, by bowling his leg breaks round the wicket into some rough created by footmarks, took 6-70 to secure an Australian victory by 54 runs. The key moment came when he bowled the England captain Peter May behind his legs for a duck. The bemused <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told by Aussie keeper Wally Grout {{that he had been}} bowled.|$|R
