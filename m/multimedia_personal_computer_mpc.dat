Hybrid methods that combine different de-interlacing techniques are widely used to take advantages from individual algorithms. The combination is normally based on the quality criterion of individual de-interlacing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a classification based data mixing algorithm for hybrid de-interlacing. The algorithm first classifies the interpolated pixels from individual de-interlacing methods and then mix them to give the final output. The optimal mixing coefficients are obtained from an off-line training, which employs the Least Mean Squared (LMS) algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{computers}} for teaching and training {{has long been a}} controversial issue. Up to the 1980 s, many educators who were keen to use computers to pass on knowledge developed various computer-based teaching and training materials, but most of these materials were capable only of delivering information in text with perhaps some computer graphics, and in many cases it proved difficult to raise learners&#x 0027; interest in the subject matters (Patrick & Fitzgibbon, 1988). In the 1990 s, there has been cheerful news for procomputer educators; the latest multimedia technology could be the solution to the problem.

40|$|We {{live in a}} time {{of change}} in the {{scholarly}} journal industry. This change predates the arrival of electronic publishing, but the increase in new technologies has accelerated many of its aspects.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the INSTANCE (Intermediate Storage Node Concept) project is to support asynchronous communication in server-based systems, like World-Wide Web and Video-on-Demand, more efficiently by a new structure for server-based systems. The proposed approach {{will lead to a}} structure that is capable to support concurrently a higher number of clients with lower costs (compared to traditional approaches). Servers, which are called intermediate storage nodes in INSTANCE, are seen as a vehicle to transfer information in asynchronous mode from provider to consumer. The protocol stack is drastically reduced at the server - in analogy to intermediate network nodes. The Integrated Layer Processing principle is applied to the handling of data management system, application, and the remaining communication protocol. 1 Introduction The availability of <b>multimedia</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> and workstations, internet services, and high-speed network services has drastically increased the use of dist [...] ...|$|R

This paper analyzes and compares the profitability of two distinct business strategies: bundling vs mass customization within a duopoly with differentiated goods and consumer uncertainty. The number and categories of highly customized and customizable products is wide. On the other hand, bundling is ever more pervasive in today’s markets, such as entertainment, consumer goods, Internet services, <b>multimedia</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computers,</b> catering, and education. The {{attention is focused on}} information goods, i. e. products with large amount of digital content, which facilitates the customizability of the products. In conclusion, mass customization is seen as an alternative strategy to differentiate firms in a highly competitive and segmented market, since it helps to provide customers with personalized products and services at a reasonably low costs through flexible mass production, thus reaching both a vast number of customers while responding to individual needs...|$|R

ISDN itself and its continuing evolution are detailed. The system developed as a part of this thesis involved the creation of an inexpensive 2 ̆ 2 phone terminal 2 ̆ 2 that can serve as an ISDN terminal and also as a bridge to a Local Area Network (LAN). The 2 ̆ 2 phone terminal 2 ̆ 2 provides a hybrid electronic mail system that allows the attachment of speech to text within a message.

As such, {{there has been an}} increasing need to develop electronically based clinical information system (CIS) for medical diagnosis and treatment. Today, with the rapid development in the computer technology, international standards and broadband telecommunication networks, it is possible to have this clinical information on demand. This paper is an attempt where we utilize technology frontier to transmit real-time medical information to improve medical quality of service (QoS). A Linux based wireless mobile ad-hoc network test bed, MANET, is created. A smart electronic stethoscope (SES) system, which consists of a low cost electronic stethoscope, a <b>multimedia</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer,</b> and a set of multimedia speakers, is designed and embedded inside the network.

40|$|The late eighties saw the {{emergence}} of a new genre of instructional media, “edutainment, ” which utilized the capabilities of <b>multimedia</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> to animate software designed to both educate and entertain young children. This paper describes the production, marketing, and play with edutainment software as a contemporary example of longstanding tensions between the cultural categories of education and entertainment, play and learning. Like prior efforts to wed learning and play, edutainment was founded on the ideal of broadening access to academic learning. Yet as it became a mainstream commercial enterprise, it was increasingly targeted toward accelerating the achievement of successful children. After first describing the industry and marketing context of edutainment, this paper describes cases of play with edutainment software in an afterschool computer club. The analysis utilizes the concepts of “multimedia genre ” and “participation genre ” to read across sites of production, distribution and consumption to examine how genres of entertainment, education, and edutainment are constituted through the circulation and play with media artifacts. As in the case of the industry and marketing context, instances of play with edutainment titles follow certain genre conventions for engagement. Titles that are based on academic content and modes of engagement, even with a wrapper of entertainment styles, invite a competitive orientation and interaction focused on fulfilling the minimal conditions for moving ahead and getting credit for completion of a task. Unlike more exploratory or construction-oriented software titles, these genres of software are marketed and keyed to the social demands of middle-class achievement...|$|R

Therefore, the mechanism to preserve the intention and to specify its requirements is needed. In this paper, taking a distributed multimedia presentation system as an example, we propose a new definition of application level QoS scheme which specifies quality of integration and synchronization of multiple media as well as quality of a single medium. The definition includes preference among QoS parameters and synchronization scaling of multiple media when some quality should be deteriorated due to system condition changing.

40|$|The need to {{transmit}} {{large amounts of}} data over limited bandwidth channels has resulted in many methods for digital data compression. The common approach is to identify and remove redundancy from the input data stream using knowledge of the source characteristics. In the case of signals intended for human observers (speech, music, pictures, etc.) it is also useful to consider {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the human sensory systems in order to achieve a greater degree of data compression. Unfortunately, achieving perceptually transparent compression requires considerable computational resources. For situations requiring extremely low computational complexity without strictly transparent coding, such as <b>multimedia</b> applications on <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> platforms, a new adaptive differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) data compression scheme is proposed. Although standard DPCM structures are widely used in singletalker speech coding systems, the models and statistical assumptions well-known for speech signals are not applicable to arbitrary audio signals such as music. The new DPCM formulation presented here includes a recursively indexed quantizer (RIQ) to eliminate the problem of overload distortion, a simple predictor structure to take advantage of the short-term correlation present in wideband audio signals, and an adaptation strategy to optimize the system to the local statistics of the input signal. Thus, the new RIQ-DPCM formulation is presented as a computationally efficient means of wideband audio compression. 1...|$|R
