25|$|Firstly, educated Indonesians {{who were}} {{sympathetic}} to the ideology of nationalism {{were involved in the}} revolution. Most of them received tertiary education and have adopted Western values and practices in their daily life. The connections with the traditional aristocratic families did not manage to stop these people from having strong beliefs in nationalism. Ultimately, they recognized that the presence of kerajaan <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the hindrances for East Sumatran society to achieve full liberalization. Members of this particular group were local governors and regional deputy governors such as Teuku Muhammad Hasan and Mohammad Amir.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} was automated in 1989, and {{the island}} has since been uninhabited. The lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in New Zealand, {{and one of its}} oldest. Due to its black and white stripes, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand's most distinctive lighthouses. There are only two other lighthouses in New Zealand of similar appearance; Cape Campbell Lighthouse also has black and white stripes, whilst Cape Palliser Lighthouse has red and white stripes. The lens from 1925 is on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea on Jervois Quay in Wellington, on loan from Maritime New Zealand. The 1865 rotating mechanism can be seen at the Bluff Maritime Museum.|$|E

25|$|For nearly {{eighteen}} aeons , all {{history has}} {{been the result of}} the struggle between two basic elements, split apart by a divine power from the very beginning: a flexible life-process on the one side, and a formless, undeveloped stasis on the other. The symbol of the former is eternal Rome, with the entire Occident lying behind her; the symbol of the latter is Constantinople, with the ossified Orient.... That the Slavs <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two world-factors, or if one prefers, the shadow of the shining image of European humanity, and therefore that the constitution of the earth might not admit philosophical reconstruction without their assent, is the great scholarly heresy of our time.|$|E
25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

500|$|Temples were {{sometimes}} referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k'uh nah, meaning [...] "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, {{and the development of}} the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the patron gods of the city, or a deified ancestor. In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.|$|E
500|$|During spring {{training}} in 2001, incumbent first baseman Mark McGwire said to Cardinals manager Tony La Russa {{that if he}} did not promote Pujols to the major league roster, [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the worst moves you make in your career." [...] La Russa later recounted the [...] "myth" [...] that Pujols only made the Opening Day roster in 2001 because Bobby Bonilla was injured. [...] According to La Russa, he and the rest of Cardinals management were impressed enough by Pujols that they decided to promote him to the big league club even before Bonilla's injury. [...] Although the team did not require Pujols to fill any particular position, the Cardinals activated him to the Opening Day roster, and he started all season at either third base, right field, left field, or first base.|$|E
500|$|After British naval expeditions in 1818 and 1827–28 had probed {{north of}} Spitsbergen {{and found no}} sign of the {{supposed}} polar sea, the quest was in abeyance for 25 years. In the 1850s, the search for the lost Franklin expedition generated a rash of incursions into the Canadian Arctic. From these forays, particularly that of Edward Inglefield in 1852, [...] emerged the theory that Smith Sound, a northerly channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, [...] <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the fabled gateways to the [...] polar sea. This brought a succession of expeditions to this area: Elisha Kent Kane in 1853–55, [...] Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860–61, Charles Francis Hall in 1872–74, and George Nares in 1875–76. No gateway was found, although both Kane and Hayes claimed, mistakenly, to have seen the Open Polar Sea from a distance.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} album's concept, and for being more humorous than the band's preceding albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's hard not to warm to this, even if his music isn't your own personal bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's not all that hard to imagine Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice."

The lead-in, the punchline and {{the execution of the}} whole scene is handled so well that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the show's most memorable ever." [...] In her review of the episode, Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote [...] "This was, overall, a very funny episode. Lots of funny references—the Trix Rabbit, Karl Malden, MASH, Star Wars, [...] "Three's Company" [...] The funniest moment for me, was the bit with Stewie walking in on Brian cross-dressing.

2500|$|It may be {{the case}} that a player does not know exactly what the payoffs of the game are or of what type his opponents are. This sort of game has {{incomplete}} information. In extensive form it is represented as a game with complete but imperfect information using the so-called Harsanyi transformation. This transformation introduces to the game the notion of nature's choice or God's choice. Consider a game consisting of an employer considering whether to hire a job applicant. The job applicant's ability <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two things: high or low. His ability level is random; he is low ability with probability 1/3 and high ability with probability 2/3. In this case, it is convenient to model nature as another player of sorts who chooses the applicant's ability according to those probabilities. Nature however does not have any payoffs. [...] Nature's choice is represented in the game tree by a non-filled node. Edges coming from a nature's choice node are labelled with the probability of the event it represents occurring.|$|E
