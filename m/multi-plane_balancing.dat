30|$|The {{residual}} {{mass unbalance}} of a rotating assembly is usually determined {{by using the}} <b>multi-plane</b> <b>balancing</b> machines. However, {{with the development of}} dynamic balancing technology, the balancing precision is very high, it is urgent to know how to control the unbalance magnitude for small vibration and stable operation in the design process. It is inevitably that the unbalance existed in the rotation, especially for the high-speed rotating machine. These mass unbalance locates at different locations of two impellers with variable magnitude of me. As expressed in unbalance force Eqs. (7), (8) and the governing Eq. (6), it is obvious seen that the unbalance Fub directly affects the motion of TC rotor and bearing system. The rotor motion may change with the variable magnitude of unbalance in turbine or compressor wheel. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between unbalance magnitude and dynamic characteristics for the small-sized and high-speed TC rotor with FRB.|$|E

The {{balancing}} {{of large}} motor and generator rotors {{is accomplished by}} a combination of balance machine corrections plus the calculated corrections determined by an Influence Coefficient Balancing computer program. The method has been applied to an 8000 HP two-pole induction machine rotor and the results are presented. The vibration is measured at several locations and speeds and the results are used to (a) ensure that the vibration levels are not excessive as the rotor speed is increased and (b) calculate the balance correction weights using a least squares Influence Coefficient Method. Measured and calculated results are presented which provide a check on the method. The results show that a <b>multi-plane</b> <b>balance</b> correction was necessary to minimize the rotor unbalance through the second critical speed...|$|R
40|$|Preface This licentiate thesis {{summarizes}} my {{work within}} the field of Signal Processing during my time in Signal Control Sweden AB from 1987 to 2002. The work has been performed in close co-operation the customers like Volvo Personvagnar AB, Sveriges Provnings- och forskningsinstitut and others. Most of the material has been published at various conferences together with the Department of Signal Processing at Blekinge Institute of Technology. However, here I {{have had the opportunity to}} expand the text to give a more thorough description of the algorithms that have been designed. The thesis consists of five parts, which are: Part I An Order Analysis Method for Interior Noise Measurements in Cars Based on a Virtual Tachometer. II A Fast <b>Multi-plane</b> Shaft <b>Balancing</b> Method for 4 -Wheel Drive Cars. III Custom Designed Filters through Time-Window Modification. IV Active Vibration Control of Cutting Operations. V Adaptive Vibration Control of a Large Dimension Carbon Fiber Boring Bar...|$|R
