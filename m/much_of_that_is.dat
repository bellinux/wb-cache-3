500|$|Lead, zinc, {{copper and}} silver are still mined at some {{places in the}} Kootenay River basin, notably at the giant Sullivan Mine near Kimberley, British Columbia, {{which is the largest}} in the Kootenay watershed. Agriculture, however, is a much less {{important}} industry, and many of the fertile riverside lands have been flooded by the construction of dams (most notably Libby Dam in Montana, which backs water into Canada). Only about two percent of the entire Kootenay basin ( [...] is used for agriculture, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> for pasture and foraging). Crops such as oats, barley and wheat account for 62 percent of the agricultural output of the region, much of which is used locally or exported by rail. The primary agricultural region is the Kootenai Valley of northern Idaho just south of Kootenay Lake.|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd like you to keep closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E
2500|$|The meeting {{could be}} {{considered}} a success given the record high oil prices of the following years, but <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also a consequence of the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States, the Iraq War, and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like China and India, which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by OPEC during the preceding period. [...] In addition to these events, the December 2002 oil strike in Venezuela, which resulted in a loss of almost 3mmbpd of crude oil production, brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude.|$|E

6000|$|The {{agent of}} the {{smelting}} company--a stout, intelligent man, who evidently did [...] "knaw tin"--conducted them first to the furnaces, in the neighbourhood of which were ranged a number of large wooden troughs or bins, all more or less filled with tin ore. The ore got from different mines, he said, differed in quality, {{as well as in}} the percentage of tin which it contained. Some had much iron mixed with it, in spite of all the washings it had undergone; some had a little copper and other substances; while some was very pure. By mixing the tin of different mines, better metal could be procured than by simply smelting the produce of each mine separately. Pointing to one of the bins, about three yards square, he told them it contained tin worth 1,000 pounds. There was a large quantity of black sand in one of the bins, which, the agent said, was got by the process of [...] "streaming." [...] It is the richest and best kind of tin ore, and used to be procured in large quantities in Cornwall--especially in ancient times--being found near the surface, but, as a matter of course, not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to be found now, the land having been turned over three times in search of it.

50|$|Enclosure was {{sometimes}} welcomed by all parties. In 1617 the common {{fields of the}} Littleton's manor of Otherton were enclosed by agreement with the occupiers.
