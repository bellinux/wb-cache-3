500|$|Thirty Chinooks {{were ordered}} by the British Government in 1978 at a price of US$200 million. These {{helicopters}} were to become British variants of the United States Army's Boeing CH-47 Chinook. ZA718 {{was one of the}} final HC1s the RAF received in February 1982. The US army introduced an upgraded Chinook, the CH-47D in the 1980s with improvements including upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, redundant and improved electrical systems, an advanced flight control system (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF designation for this new standard of aircraft was the Chinook HC2 with ZA718 becoming the first RAF airframe to be converted in 199394. Bravo November has been refitted and upgraded numerous times during its service in the British Armed Forces.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} verification {{results of}} the EnergyPlus variable refrigerant flow (VRF) heat pump computer model using <b>manufacturer's</b> performance <b>data.</b> The paper {{provides an overview of}} the VRF model, presents the verification methodology, and discusses the results. The verification provides quantitative comparison of full and part-load performance to <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>data</b> in cooling-only and heating-only modes of operation. The VRF heat pump computer model uses dual range bi-quadratic performance curves to represent capacity and Energy Input Ratio (EIR) as a function of indoor and outdoor air temperatures, and dual range quadratic performance curves as a function of part-load-ratio for modeling part-load performance. These performance curves are generated directly from <b>manufacturer's</b> published performance <b>data.</b> The verification compared the simulation output directly to <b>manufacturer's</b> performance <b>data,</b> and found that the dual range equation fit VRF heat pump computer model predicts the <b>manufacturer's</b> performance <b>data</b> very well over a wide range of indoor and outdoor temperatures and part-load conditions. The predicted capacity and electric power deviations are comparbale to equation-fit HVAC computer models commonly used for packaged and split unitary HVAC equipment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient method {{to estimate the}} equivalent circuit parameters of three-phase induction motor from its <b>manufacturer</b> <b>data</b> for steady state analysis using improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). The IPSO integrates the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the chaotic sequences. The optimization problem is based on minimizing the error between the computed performance of the equivalent circuit and the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>data.</b> The application of chaotic sequences in PSO is an efficient strategy to improve the global searching capability and escape from local minima. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated for two test motors, and the test results are compared with the simple PSO and classical parameter estimation methods.

40|$|This paper explores {{performing}} identifiability {{analysis on}} the equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters of an electric machine (EM) using its impedance response. When modelling the ECM of an EM for room temperature conditions, some of the ECM parameters {{can be obtained from}} the <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>data.</b> However, as the temperature of an EM increases this significantly changes the underlying physics (resistivity, capacitance and inductance) of machine parameters, therefore the <b>manufacturers</b> <b>data</b> become inaccurate for equivalent circuit modelling purposes. ECM parameters need to be obtained from the frequency response under the different temperature conditions. To achieve this a nonlinear optimisation scheme with constraints is proposed for the purpose of ECM parameter identification, whereby a temperature-dependent ECM is derived. This work has important applications in EM design and condition monitoring and provides a valuable precursor towards developing age-dependent model...|$|R
