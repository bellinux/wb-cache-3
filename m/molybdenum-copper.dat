40|$|Superconducting Gamma-ray {{detectors}} {{offer an}} order of magnitude higher energy resolution than conventional high-purity germanium detectors. This can significantly increase the precision of non-destructive isotope analysis for nuclear samples where line overlap affects the errors of the measurement. We have developed Gamma-detectors based on superconducting <b>molybdenum-copper</b> sensors and bulk tin absorbers for nuclear science and national security applications. They have, depending on design, an energy resolution between {approx} 50 and {approx} 150 eV FWHM at {approx} 100 keV. Here we apply this detector technology to the measurement of uranium isotope ratios, and discuss the trade-offs between energy resolution and quantum efficiency involved in detector design...|$|E
40|$|In the article, {{there has}} been <b>molybdenum-copper</b> bulk samples sintering, {{obtained}} the spark plasma sintering technology. XRD-diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Vickers hardness test were carried out in this work. X-ray diffractometry analysis {{has shown that the}} products consist of the following main phases such as copper of cubic system (space group Fm- 3 m, No. 225) and molybdenum also of a cubic crystalline structure (space group Im 3 m, No. 229). Results of scanning electron microscopy for the sintered samples have shown that all bulk sintering samples have a high density. The optimal sintering temperature is 1060 oC. This {{is due to the fact}} that the bulk sample, sintered by 1060 oC, has a minimum amount of intergranular spaces. Vickers hardness test has shown that the highest hardness is 388 HV, at the same time hardness of pure molybdenum is 147 HV...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{characterization}} measurements on a 1280 pixel superconducting bolometer array designed for operation at wavelengths around 450 µm. The array is a prototype for the sub-arrays which will form the focal plane for the SCUBA- 2 sub-mm camera, being built for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii. With over 10 000 pixels in total, it will provide a huge improvement in both sensitivity and mapping speed over existing instruments. The array consists of <b>molybdenum-copper</b> bi-layer TES (transition edge sensor) pixels, bonded to a multiplexer. The detectors operate at a temperature of approximately 175 mK, and require a heat sink at a temperature of approximately 60 mK. In contrast to previous TES arrays, the multiplexing elements are located beneath each pixel (an “in-focal plane ” configuration). We {{present the results}} of electrical and optical measurements, and show that the optical NEP (noise equivalent power) is les...|$|E
40|$|Nano-structured <b>molybdenum-copper</b> {{composites}} {{have been}} produced through severe plastic deformation of liquid-metal infiltrated Cu 30 Mo 70 and Cu 50 Mo 50 (wt. %) starting materials. Processing was carried out using high pressure torsion at room temperature with no subsequent sintering treatment, producing a porosity-free, ultrafine grained composite. Extensive deformation of the Cu 50 Mo 50 composite via two-step high-pressure torsion produced equiaxed nanoscale grains of Mo and Cu with a grain size of 10 - 15 nm. Identical treatment of Cu 30 Mo 70 produced a ultrafine, lamellar structure, comprised of Cu and Mo layers with thicknesses of ~ 5 nm and ~ 10 - 20 nm, respectively and an interlamellar spacing of 9 nm. This microstructure differs substantially from that of HPT-deformed Cu-Cr and Cu-W composites, in which the lamellar microstructure breaks down at high strains. The ultrafine-grained structure and absence of porosity resulted in composites with Vickers hardness values of 600 for Cu 30 Mo 70 and 475 for Cu 50 Mo 50. The ability to produce Cu 30 Mo 70 nanocomposites {{with a combination of}} high strength, and a fine, oriented microstructure should be of interest for thermoelectric applications.

40|$|In {{the next}} decade, new {{ground-based}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CCAT-prime, and CMB-S 4 {{will increase the}} number of detectors observing the CMB by an order of magnitude or more, dramatically improving our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics. These projects will deploy receivers with as many as hundreds of thousands of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers coupled to Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) -based readout systems. It is well known that superconducting devices such as TESes and SQUIDs are sensitive to magnetic fields. However, the effects of magnetic fields on TESes are not easily predicted due to the complex behavior of the superconducting transition, which motivates direct measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of these devices. We present comparative four-lead measurements of the critical temperature versus applied magnetic field of AlMn TESes varying in geometry, doping, and leg length, including Advanced ACT (AdvACT) and POLARBEAR- 2 /Simons Array bolometers. <b>Molybdenum-copper</b> bilayer ACTPol TESes are also tested and are found to be more sensitive to magnetic fields than the AlMn devices. We present an observation of weak-link-like behavior in AlMn TESes at low critical currents. We also compare measurements of magnetic sensitivity for time division multiplexing SQUIDs and frequency division multiplexing microwave rf-SQUIDs. We discuss the implications of our measurements on the magnetic shielding required for future experiments that aim to map the CMB to near-fundamental limits.

40|$|A {{variety of}} mineral {{deposits}} were formed during the tectonic {{evolution of the}} Mascarene-Nerepis and Rolling Dam Belts, in southwestern New Brunswick. The Mascarene-Nerepis Belt is mainly underlain by intensely deformed Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian andesitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks with interbedded calcareous siltstone and slate. The Rolling Dam Belt consists largely of Ordovician graphitic slate overlain by Upper Silurian to Lower Devonian greywacke and slate. During Middle Devonian time, both belts underwent polyphase deformation and a large batholith composed mainly of granite and related plutonic rocks was emplaced (Acadian orogeny). Base metal deposits designated as early tectonic in this report occupy dilatant structures related to group 3 folds, along the margins of these plutons. In the Mascarene-Nerepis Belt, base metal deposits occur in andesite and rhyolite tuffs, and calcareous pelitic sedimentary rocks deformed by these structures. Gold-arseno-write-quartz veins occupy similar structures in graphitic slate of the Rolling Dam Belt. A few early tectonic deposits occur. in plutonic rocks. Nickel-copper sulfides occur as massive bodies and disseminated blebs in a mafic pluton in the St. Stephen area (Rolling Dam Belt). Tungsten-bearing greisen veins occur in granitic rocks of the Square Lake area (Mascarene-Nerepis Belt). The second major orogeny, which occurred during the Carboniferous,. is generally characterized by open folding, and wrench- and block-faulting. Volcanism {{was active in the}} Mount Pleasant area (Rolling Dam Belt) and numerous small intrusions were locally emplaced in both belts <b>Molybdenum-copper,</b> tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth, tin- and silver-base metal sulfide deposits, which were formed during this period, repre-sent the late tectonic metallization episodes in both belts...|$|E
40|$|This {{volume is}} the 50 th {{book in the}} two Sigels' series (44 in MIBS and 6 in MILS) and this is celebrated with a compre­hensive Author Index given {{at the end of}} this Volume 6. Supported by nearly 1700 {{references}} and about 160 illustrations (many in color), Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors highlights the function of these metal-carbon bonds in life, but also their importance in research. Written by 20 internationally recognized experts, 12 stimulating chapters provide an authoritative and timely resource for scientists working in the wide range from physical and inorganic biochemistry all the way through to physiology and medicine. This volume is devoted to naturally occurring metal-carbon bonds, a topic recently obtaining (again) significant momentum, largely – but not only – due to new insights gained with hydrogenases. The field started out about 50 years ago when coenzyme B 12 was identified as organometallic derivative of vitamin B 12. This moved the cobalt-carbon bond into the center of interest and consequently, the first two chapters of this book are devoted to the organometallic chemistry of B 12 coenzymes and to the biochemistry of cobalamin- and corrinoid-dependent enzymes. B 12 coenzymes are required in the metabolism of a broad range of organisms including humans; however, only microorganisms have the ability to biosynthesize B 12 and other natural corrinoids. This fact alone, together with new metabolic insights (e. g., riboswitches), guarantees a continued fascination – not only for the B 12 community. Related to Co-corrin, the Ni-porphinoid unit (F 430) is the prosthetic group of methyl-coenzyme M reductase. This enzyme, the topic of Chapter 3, catalyzes the methane-forming step in methanogenic archaea and most probably also the methane-oxidizing step in methanotrophic archaea. Chapter 4 deals with acetyl-coenzyme A synthases/carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, i. e., bifunctional nickel-containing enzymes, which catalyze the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and the reversible reduction of CO 2 to CO in anaerobic, mostly thermophilic, organisms, able to grow chemiauto­trophically on simple inorganic compounds like CO 2. Ni-C bonds with methyl, acetyl, carbonyl, and carboxylate groups are evidenced. [NiFe]-, [FeFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenases are detailed in the next three chapters. These enzymes, present in many microorganisms, catalyze the oxidation of molecular hydrogen or the reduction of protons. All of them have a Fe(CO) x unit in their active site. Iron-cyanide units occur in [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases. However, despite the indicated similarities they clearly have independent evolutionary origins. The participation of the commonly considered toxic ligands CO and CN– in the active sites of hydrogenases is still a surprise to many; yet, exactly their occurrence incites a great interest in physical chemists as well as evolutionary biologists. The dual role of heme as cofactor and substrate in the biosynthesis of carbon monoxide is the topic of Chapter 8. Carbon monoxide is a ubiquitous molecule in the atmosphere but it is also produced in mammalian, plastidic, and bacterial cells as a byproduct in the catalytic cycle of heme degradation as catalyzed by the enzyme heme oxygenase. Most fascinating is the fact that the biological role of CO spans the range from toxic to cytoprotective, depending on its concentration. CO generated by heme oxygenase is now known to function in several important physiological processes, including vasodilation, apoptosis, inflammation, and possibly neurotransmission. The relevance of the copper-carbon bond in biological inorganic chemistry will probably not easily come to the mind of most biochemical and inorganic researchers. However, there is a vast amount of literature, cunningly presented in Chapter 9. CO as well as CN– have proven very useful in obtaining insights into the active site structures and mechanisms of copper proteins. Naturally, in these instances both ligands are inhibitors and used as probes. However, there is also the recently described copper-carbon unit present in a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, which contains a novel <b>molybdenum-copper</b> catalytic site, or the copper(I) -arene unit, which was evidenced in a bacterial copper chaperone. Apparently also a plant receptor site (ETR 1) utilizes Cu(I) to sense the growth hormone ethylene. Chapter 10 focuses on the interaction of CN– with enzymes containing vanadium, manganese, non-heme iron, and zinc, and the inhibiting properties of this ligand, allowing its use as a probe. The reaction mechanism of the molybdenum hydroxylase xanthine oxidoreductase is revisited in Chapter 11; previously a molybdenum-carbon bond was postulated but now proof is presented against its formation. The terminating Chapter 12 reviews briefly the most popular computational approaches employed in theoretical studies of bioorganometallic species by providing detailed examples...|$|E
