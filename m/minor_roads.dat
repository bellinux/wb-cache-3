5|$|After Iron Bridge, the {{character}} of the Way changes with the steeper hills of the earlier sections giving way to a gentler gradient that meanders between low hills. These latter sections also contain a great deal of road walking as the Way crosses farmland via <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> and boreens.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, {{was opened}} along the B3114 {{on the western}} part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has {{all-weather}} surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. <b>Minor</b> <b>roads</b> around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.|$|E
5|$|Rivington is to {{the east}} to the M61 motorway, which connects the M6 and Preston to the north with the M60 and the Greater Manchester {{conurbation}} to the south. The nearest access is at Junction 6. The village is accessed by <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> from Horwich {{to the south and}} Adlington to the west. A winding road to the north passes through Anglezarke and a road over the moors to the east leads to Belmont. The nearest places with regular bus services are Horwich to the south and Adlington to the west, which are served by buses between Bolton and Chorley or Preston.|$|E

40|$|At unsignalized intersections, left-turning {{vehicles}} from <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> approach {{are more}} likely to be involved in traffic conflicts and traffic crashes and are one of the most leading factors impacting traffic efficiency and capacity. The authors of the paper observed that some drivers behaved illegally and dangerously while performing left turns from <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> approach, resulting in abnormal trajectories at unsignalized intersections. By applying binary logistic analysis, a probability prediction model was developed to explore various factors affecting probability of normal path taken by drivers while turning left from <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> approach. Based upon the model, measures such as lowering running speeds of vehicles on major <b>road</b> or <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> and adding more lanes on <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> can be used to encourage more drivers to take normal vehicle paths, which is helpful for the improvement of traffic safety, efficiency, and capacity. Results of the paper can be used for the guidance of design and management of unsignalized intersections...|$|R

5|$|The 4th Cavalry Division, {{which had}} {{advanced}} to capture Beisan {{in the afternoon}} of 20 September, now controlled the area north along the River Jordan, while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned Afulah and the Nazareth area. Here motor ambulances, which had {{been working in the}} Judean Hills, rejoined their division on 22 September. The Australian Mounted Division's 3rd Light Horse Brigade occupied Jenin. In consequence, all direct routes northwards were now controlled by the Desert Mounted Corps, forcing the retreating Ottoman Seventh Army and what remained of the Eighth Army to withdraw along <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> and tracks heading eastwards across the Jordan River, towards the Hedjaz railway.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills are crossed by {{a network}} of <b>minor</b> <b>roads.</b> There are several major roads {{including}} the A30, A303 and A35. The M5 motorway is at the northwestern boundary of the AONB. The Bristol to Exeter line {{and the remains of}} the Grand Western Canal run, quite close in places, {{to the west of the}} M5 motorway but do not pass through the Blackdown Hills. The West of England Main Line passes through the southern part of the hills between Axminster and Honiton, including a tunnel section east of Honiton.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, {{built to}} link Bolton and Bury with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was 15miles 1furlong (24.3km) long. It was {{accessed}} via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks {{were required to}} climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several <b>minor</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|E

5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> are intersected before the roadway {{turns to the}} west after about , before {{turning back to the}} north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR22 in south Prosser.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} through the Peak District are the A57 (Snake Pass) between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, the Cat and Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton, {{and in the}} extreme north of the Park the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds, which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge. These major roads, {{together}} with other <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> and lanes in the area, are attractive to drivers, but the Peak's popularity makes road congestion {{and the availability of}} parking spaces a significant problem, especially during summer. This led to the proposal of a congestion charge in 2005, but this was later rejected.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and <b>minor</b> <b>roads</b> were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E
30|$|The {{difference}} in opportunity {{provided by the}} two road options {{is due to the}} assumed constraints of the <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> development. Referring to the pathway analysis in FigureÂ  4, we are reminded that while the barrier and rail developments can be commissioned with only <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> developments, an airport would need more major developments to support the surface access demands of passengers. The <b>minor</b> <b>road</b> developments pathways therefore lack both the airport impacts and system effects from the airport interacting with the other elements, significantly changing its opportunity value compared to the major road development pathways.|$|R

5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of <b>minor</b> <b>roads,</b> the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formedâearly residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E
