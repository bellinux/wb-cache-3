We explore how such customs affect the educational investment decisions of young singles and the subsequent joint labor supply decisions of partnered couples. We consider two separate matching paradigms-one where partners <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> money and the other where partners <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> romantic reasons orthogonal to productivity or debt. Whereas <b>marrying</b> <b>for</b> money generates greater investment efficiency, romantic matching, by {{increasing the number of}} educated and talented women who participate in the labour market, increases aggregate productivity.

60|$|Against {{all such}} evil parental promptings, however, a great {{safeguard}} is afforded to society by the wholesome and essentially philosophical teaching of romance and poetry. I do {{not approve of}} novels. They {{are for the most}} part a futile and unprofitable form of literature; and it may profoundly be regretted that the mere blind laws of supply and demand should have diverted such an immense number of the ablest minds in England, France, and America, from more serious subjects to the production of such very frivolous and, on the whole, ephemeral works of art. But the novel has this one great counterpoise of undoubted good to set against all the manifold disadvantages and shortcomings of romantic literature--that it always appeals to the true internal promptings of inherited instinct, and opposes the foolish and selfish suggestions of interested outsiders. It is the perpetual protest of poor banished human nature against the expelling pitchfork of calculating expediency in the matrimonial market. While parents and moralists are for ever saying, 'Don't <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> beauty; don't <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> inclination; don't <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> love: <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> money, <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> social position, <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> advancement, <b>marry</b> <b>for</b> our convenience, not for your own,' the romance-writer is for ever urging, on the other hand, 'Marry for love, and for love only.' His great theme in all ages has been the opposition between parental or other external wishes and the true promptings of the young and unsophisticated human heart. He has been the chief ally of sentiment and of nature. He has filled the heads of all our girls with what Sir George Campbell describes off-hand as 'foolish ideas about love.' He has preserved us from the hateful conventions of civilisation. He has exalted the claims of personal attraction, of the mysterious native yearning of heart for heart, of the indefinite and indescribable element of mutual selection; and, in so doing, he has unconsciously proved himself the best friend of human improvement and the deadliest enemy of all those hideous 'social lies which warp us from the living truth.' His mission is to deliver the world from Dr. Johnson and Sir George Campbell.|$|R
