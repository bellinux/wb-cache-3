25|$|Faraday's law {{describes}} {{two different}} phenomena: the <b>motional</b> EMF {{generated by a}} magnetic force on a moving wire (see Lorentz force), and the transformer EMF generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation). James Clerk Maxwell {{drew attention to the}} separate physical phenomena in 1861. This is believed to be a unique example in physics of where such a fundamental law is invoked to explain two such different phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Faraday {{explained}} {{electromagnetic induction}} using a concept he called lines of force. However, {{scientists at the}} time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly {{because they were not}} formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe <b>motional</b> EMF. Heaviside's version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell's equations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnetic}} force (...) {{component of the}} Lorentz force is responsible for <b>motional</b> electromotive force (or <b>motional</b> EMF), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term [...] "motional EMF" [...] is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF {{is due to the}} motion of the wire.|$|E
2500|$|An emf is induced in a coil or {{conductor}} {{whenever there}} is {{change in the}} flux linkages. Depending {{on the way in}} which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is statically induced. [...] The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as <b>motional</b> emf. [...] When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is dynamically induced. The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field [...] is often referred to as transformer emf.|$|E

The overall accuracy of single-trapped-ion-based optical standards closely approaches that of the state-of-the-art caesium fountain standards. Large ensembles of ultracold alkaline earth atoms have provided impressive clock stability for short averaging times, surpassing that of single-ion-based systems. So far, interrogation of neutral-atom-based optical standards {{has been carried out}} primarily in free space, unavoidably including atomic <b>motional</b> effects that typically limit the overall system accuracy. An alternative approach is to explore the ultranarrow optical transitions of atoms held in an optical lattice. The atoms are tightly localized so that Doppler and photon-recoil related effects on the transition frequency are eliminated.” ...|$|E
2500|$|G. W. Pierce had an eye {{for finding}} the main {{sticking}} point in physical processes. For electronics he saw that resonance was a key phenomenon. His five-part series [...] "Experiments on resonance in wireless telegraph circuits in Physical Review (1904-7) are evidence of his leadership. By 1910 his first textbook Principles of Wireless Telegraphy was published. It is in this text, and others by John Ambrose Fleming, that the term modulation is first used to describe imprinting an audio wave onto a high-frequency carrier wave by variation of amplitude of the carrier. In 1912 he worked with A. E. Kennelly on <b>motional</b> impedance (see below). In 1914 he was assigned the directorship of the Cruft Physics Laboratory at Harvard. Then in 1917 he gained the rank of professor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{galvanometer}} {{usually only}} measures {{the first term}} in the EMF which contributes the current in circuit, although sometimes it can measure the incorporation of the second term such as when the second term contributes part of the current which the galvanometer measures as <b>motional</b> EMF, e.g. in the Faraday's disk experiment. In the situation above, the first term is zero and only the first term leads a current that the galvanometer measures, {{so there is no}} induced voltage. However, Faraday's Law still holds since the apparent change of the magnetic flux goes to the second term in the above generalization of EMF. But it is not measured by the galvanometer. Remember [...] is the local velocity of a point on the circuit, not a charge carrier. After all, both/all these situations are consistent with the concern of relativity and microstructure of matter, and/or the completeness of Maxwell equation and Lorentz formula, or the combination of them, Hamiltonian mechanics.|$|E

5000|$|Thus <b>motional</b> {{molecular}} energy (‘heat energy’) from hotter surroundings, like faster-moving {{molecules in}} a flame or violently vibrating iron atoms {{in a hot}} plate, will melt or boil a substance (the system) at the temperature of its melting or boiling point. That amount of <b>motional</b> energy from the surroundings that is required for melting or boiling is called the phase-change energy, specifically the enthalpy of fusion or of vaporization, respectively. This phase-change energy breaks bonds between the molecules in the system (not chemical bonds inside the molecules that hold the atoms together) rather than contributing to the <b>motional</b> energy and making the molecules move any faster - so it does not raise the temperature, but instead enables the molecules to break free to move as a liquid or as a vapor.|$|E
