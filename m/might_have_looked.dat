The Ministry decided to present the interior as it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility's closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house being turned into a visitor facility.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> in operation.|$|E
5|$|About 1,150 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths {{as a result of}} evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces antarcticus, and Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.|$|E

25|$|The multidomed {{church is}} a typical form of Russian church {{architecture}} that distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the Christianization of Kievan Rus', were multi-domed, which has led some historians to speculate about how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked.</b> Examples of these early churches are the 13-domed wooden Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (989) and the 25-domed stone Desyatinnaya Church in Kiev (989â€“996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in Russian architecture, for example 13 domes symbolize Christ with 12 Apostles, while 25 domes means the same with an additional 12 Prophets of the Old Testament. The multiple domes of Russian churches were often comparatively smaller than Byzantine domes.|$|E

The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E

The design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> uninviting and resembled a [...] "concrete bunker". However, the prisms were later found to be unworkable, as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards.

In particular, a facial reconstruction during the final episode showing what Jesus <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like garnered significant media attention. In the lead-up to episode one, several newspapers, including The Daily Mail and The Guardian, ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of Jesus. British television listings magazine Radio Times featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 March issue under the headline [...] "Is This the Face of Jesus?". This cover and its headline received criticism from some commentators for being sensationalist and misleading.|$|E
500|$|James Longstreet {{suffered}} most severely {{from the}} wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a Republican after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance.

500|$|In {{the essay}} [...] "Flood Barriers" [...] in the 2007 Panini Books reprint {{collection}} of Eighth Doctor comic strips from Doctor Who Magazine strip editor Clayton Hickman reveals that Russell T Davies had authorised {{the comic strip}} to depict the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the Ninth {{at the end of}} the story arc, The Flood. The regeneration would have been witnessed by the Eighth Doctor's companion, Destrii, and Hickman writes that the intent was to continue with a Ninth Doctor: Year One story arc with the Ninth Doctor and Destrii. However, when this arc was vetoed by both Russell T Davies and series producer Julie Gardner the creative team felt unable to regenerate the Doctor without Destrii's presence and the decision was made not to depict the regeneration in the comic strip. The reprint collection includes a specially-drawn panel showing how the Ninth Doctor <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> in the comic strip immediately after his regeneration, wearing the Eighth Doctor's costume and being tended to by Destrii.|$|E
500|$|Son of God (also {{known as}} Jesus: The Complete Story and Jesus: The Real Story) is an award-winning British {{documentary}} series that chronicles {{the life of}} Jesus Christ using scientific and contemporary historical evidence.

The executive producer was Ruth Pitt and it was directed by Jean-Claude Bragardâ€”it took a total of 16 months to produce and cost [...] A full symphonic score was composed by James Whitbourn.

However, in the final, he was defeated 10â€“8 by qualifier Ricky Walden. O'Sullivan was leading, but Walden pulled back four frames in a row to win the match. In the Premier League, he secured a 7â€“2 win over Mark Selby, which meant that he had won the event eight times in total, and five times consecutively. However, O'Sullivan failed to defend his UK Championship title, losing to Joe Perry 5â€“9 in the second round. O'Sullivan had conceded the twelfth game of the match to go 5â€“7 down, although Perry held a lead of only 23 points to zero. Commenting afterwards, O'Sullivan said [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like I lost my head or whatever, but I'm sure I'll bounce back."

500|$|While rejecting this {{thematic}} {{concern as}} unrealized by Argento, McDonagh {{noted that the}} result of the director's experiment is a strange [...] "architectural landscape" [...] that becomes the [...] "key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." [...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> had fascism not fallen.|$|E
500|$|Many of the period's artworks were {{commissioned}} by clergy for their churches, with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An {{idea of how}} such church interiors <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> {{can be seen from}} both van Eyck's Madonna in the Church and van der Weyden's [...] [...] According to Nash, van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, {{and the manner in which}} images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, [...] "any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes". Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time. Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the Ghent Altarpiece. It was destroyed by French artillery during the bombardment of Brussels in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.|$|E

It consistently referred to the [...] "alleged massacre", attributed the deaths of about 100 Bosniaks to [...] "exhaustion" [...] and concluded: [...] "the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law [...] would probably stand less than 100." [...] The report dismissed as [...] "mentally disturbed" [...] a Bosnian Serb soldier who had admitted participating in the killings, and claimed that the survivors' stories were a product of their imaginations: [...] "To walk for almost 20 days in an area that might be full of landmines, without any food and water, under the fear of being shot from any direction was such a trauma that soldiers sometimes mixed reality with illusions. Having looked at dead bodies under such psychological , some Muslim soldiers could have believed what they imagined."

Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls.

[...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail.

500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
