40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 42) The African continental {{plate is}} composed {{of a series of}} cratons and <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> with activation ages ranging from the present to the Archean. Although previous studies show the assembly of Africa has left behind a complex crust and lithospheric fabric, the style and timing of deformation is not well known. To study the degree and style of deformation of continental lithosphere during rifting and collisional events, I use seismic anisotropy to measure mineral alignment and strain accommodated by these tectonic events. Here I study seismic anisotropy beneath the African continent using instruments within the Africa Array and permanent Global Seismic Network stations located throughout Africa. I use SKS phases and shear wave splitting techniques for 28 teleseismic earthquake events. Stations located in the Ethiopian rift zone yield a NE-SW fast direction with the largest delay times of 1. 5 s. One station (KOWA) located in the West African craton and three other stations located on the West African coast display a NW-SE fast direction and average delay times of 0. 8 s. A group of stations located on Archean crust in central Africa skirt the Congo craton and display consistent NNE fast directions and delay times of 1. 0 s. Two stations, LSZ and TEZI are located in the Damara suture belt between the Congo and Kaapvaal cratons display a NE-SW fast direction parallel to the suture axis. New stations available south of the Kaapvaal craton reveal a NE fast direction with delay times that vary from 0. 5 to 1. 3 s. These results indicate that seismic anisotropy across the African continent is not uniform as might be suggested from absolute plate motion. Our results, however, do show consistent variations between cratonic regions and <b>mobile</b> <b>belts.</b> The delay times averaged over the cratonic regions is 0. 67 s +/- 0. 14 s and are significantly smaller than delay times observed in <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> of 1. 4 s +/- 0. 07 s. Comparison of the fast direction of anisotropy within cratons with current plate motion suggests {{that the majority of the}} splitting observations within cratons are due to remnant fossil fabric from previous collisional events and has very little contribution from sublithospheric mantle flow today. We suggest that repeated convergent and rifting events causes depletion and dehydration within a craton creating stronger, and stable lithosphere that is resistant to deformation during later collisional events. By contrast, <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> that are younger in age and more fertile are more readily deformed under large tectonic stresses. Remnant or ancient anisotropic fabric may thus be preserved in cratonic lithosphere where it is stored from previous collisions while <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> reflect the most recent tectonic events...|$|R

25|$|Like other volcanoes {{around the}} Pacific Ocean, Mayon {{is a part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the {{southeast}} side of Luzon, close to the Philippine Trench, which is the convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is driven under the Philippine <b>Mobile</b> <b>Belt.</b> When a continental plate meets an oceanic plate, the lighter and thicker continental material overrides the thinner and heavier oceanic plate, forcing it down into the Earth's mantle and melting it. Superheated magma and gases may be forced through weaknesses in the continental crust caused by the subduction of the oceanic plate, and one such exit point is Mayon.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Taiwan {{lies in a}} complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate {{to the west and}} north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine <b>Mobile</b> <b>Belt</b> on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island is {{primarily}} made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted {{as a result of the}} detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the landform, along with a fellow landform, the Urdaneta Plateau (a remnant of mantle plume), is {{identified}} in one study as at least five sequences of propagating rifts, probably triggered by mantle flowing away from the mantle thermal anomaly. Its presence of the landform disrupts the continuity of this region (known as the Philippine-East Luzon Trench) by continuously colliding with the Sierra Madre mountain range of eastern portion of the island of Luzon. Though it is generally thought that the Philippine Sea Plate is being subducted under the Philippine <b>Mobile</b> <b>Belt,</b> under the rules of tectonic subduction, {{there appears to be}} a resistance to this because of the presence of the landform, and instead, the plate is being displaced into the northern portion of Luzon to the west.|$|E
30|$|Probably one of {{the most}} {{significant}} heterogeneities of a continental lithosphere is the noticeable difference in the thickness and properties of its cratonic and mobile parts. The trans-continental <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> (Paleoorogens/ paleo-sutures) represent a relatively thinner, warm, wet and weak lithosphere, which makes it more vulnerable to episodic mantle (or plume) upwellings and compressional forces. Here evidence is presented from the Indian continental lithosphere to show that these properties of <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> (MB) facilitate channeling of thermomagmatic fluxes (TMF) in both lateral as well as vertical directions. This, to a major extent, can account for the observed concentration (or focusing) of geophysical anomalies, tectonomagmatic features and strain along these MBs. In addition, a closer examination of the three continental breakups of Greater India since the Cretaceous reveals that the combination of a sufficiently weakened MB and mantle plume could become ‘fatal’ for the supercontinental stability. On the other hand, the thick (> 200 km) or deep-rooted continental lithosphere beneath cratons is characterized by a relatively cold and dry lithosphere, which resists remobilization. From this relative impenetrability, TMFs are channeled mostly through the MBs following the long-term stability of the cratonic lithosphere. This difference in cratonic and MB regimes results in strongly heterogeneous thermal blanketing. However, in certain situations, the edge of a cratonic region may also get chipped-off following a number of thermotectonic rejuvenations of adjoining MBs—as exemplified by the breakup of the Antongil and Masora cratonic blocks (now lying on the Madagascar) from the Western Dharwar craton (India) during the India- Madagascar separation. From the study of supercontinental dispersals, it seems that the processes of breakup along pre-existing <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> may be globally applicable. This is, at times, also accompanied by chipping of cratons.|$|R
50|$|The geology of Algeria is diverse; {{the country}} divides into three {{different}} tectono-stratigraphic domains. In {{the south and}} west is the West African Craton which consists of Precambrian granitic basement and surrounding Neoproterozoic <b>mobile</b> <b>belts.</b> Further south the Tuareg Shield comprises the Hoggar, Adrar des Iforas and Air sub-shields which have each been affected by tectono-thermal events touching much of the continent. In the north are the Alpine chain mountains with a succession of folded and over-thrusted strata.|$|R
5000|$|Heating of the lithosphere, and the {{associated}} increase in buoyancy, is one possible mechanism proposed for the large degrees of uplift of the African superswell. Evidence of extensive volcanism and rifting in eastern Africa during the Cenozoic supports the idea that lithospheric heating was occurring {{during the time of}} uplift. Heat flow anomalies must be considered in order to justify lithospheric heating as a possible elevation mechanism in southern Africa. When comparing heat flow measurements in southern Africa <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> to average global heat flow values, a positive anomaly is observed. This anomaly may not be attributed to shallow, crustal heat generation, as the <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> have differing tectonic histories. Deeper sources of heat generation in the lithosphere can thus be considered as an explanation for heat flow anomalies. [...] Heating of the lithosphere may also be explained by movement of southern Africa over several hotspots, which now exist beneath the oceanic portion of the superswell. The region of mantle beneath the African superswell would have been insulated by the supercontinent Pangea in the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic, providing a final observation supporting elevated temperature conditions as a mechanism for uplift.|$|R
25|$|Philippine Rise is a {{submerged}} extinct volcanic ridge {{located at}} 16 degrees 30 minutes N, 124 degrees 45 minutes E {{off the coast}} of Luzon, with the size of about 250km in diameter and rises over 2,000 meters (2km.) above the sea floor, from below 5,000 meters (5km.) below sea level to above 3,000 meters (3km.) below sea level. Its area is close to the Benham Seamount, located at 15 degrees 48 minutes N, 124 degrees 15 minutes E. The precise location is somewhere near the east of the Philippine Trench and near the south of the East Luzon Trench, both of which absorb the subducting force of the Philippine Sea Plate under the Philippine <b>Mobile</b> <b>Belt,</b> a collage of large blocks of that crust that amalgamated prior to the collision of the Philippine Sea Plate with the Eurasian Plate.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian {{portion of}} the Pacific Northwest began forming during the early Jurassic period {{when a group of}} active {{volcanic}} islands collided against a pre-existing continental margin and coastline of Western Canada. These volcanic islands, known as the Intermontane Islands by geoscientists, were formed on a pre-existing tectonic plate called the Intermontane Plate about 245million years ago by subduction of the former Insular Plate to its west during the Triassic period. This subduction zone records another subduction zone called the Intermontane Trench under an ancient ocean between the Intermontane Islands and the former continental margin of Western Canada called the Slide Mountain Ocean. This arrangement of two parallel subduction zones is unusual in that very few twin subduction zones exist on Earth; the Philippine <b>Mobile</b> <b>Belt</b> off the eastern coast of Asia {{is an example of a}} modern twin subduction zone. As the Intermontane Plate drew closer to the pre-existing continental margin by ongoing subduction under the Slide Mountain Ocean, the Intermontane Islands drew closer to the former continental margin and coastline of Western Canada, supporting a volcanic arc on the former continental margin of Western Canada. As the North American Plate drifted west and the Intermontane Plate continued to drift east to the ancient continental margin of Western Canada, the Slide Mountain Ocean began to close by ongoing subduction under the Slide Mountain Ocean. This subduction zone eventually jammed and shut down completely about 180million years ago, ending the arc volcanism on the ancient continental margin of Western Canada and the Intermontane Islands collided, forming a long chain of deformed volcanic and sedimentary rock called the Intermontane Belt, which consists of deeply cut valleys, high plateaus, and rolling uplands. This collision also crushed and folded sedimentary and igneous rocks, creating a mountain range called the Kootenay Fold Belt which existed in far eastern British Columbia.|$|E

40|$|Rifting has {{occurred}} worldwide along preexisting <b>mobile</b> <b>belts,</b> which are therefore thought to control rift orientation {{on a large}} scale. On a smaller scale, shear zones within <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> are reactivated as rift faults. In NW Namibia, shear zones of the Neoproterozoic Kaoko Belt run sub-parallel to the present-day continental passive margin and are inferred to have been reactivated during opening of the South Atlantic ocean. However, the extent of this reactivation {{and the influence of}} the reactivated shear zones on South Atlantic rifting is largely unknown. A combined remote sensing and field study was conducted to quantify offsets that are a direct function of shear zone reactivation. The shear zones of the Kaoko Belt are partly overlain by the Paraná-Etendeka volcanic rocks, which were emplaced shortly before or simultaneously to the Atlantic rifting. Faulting within these volcanic rocks can be linked to syn- or post-rift movements. Along the shear zones, down-faulting of the basalts is widespread along listric faults where half-graben form in the hanging wall. At three sites we could determine vertical offsets of ~ 1180 m, ~ 470 m, and ~ 70 m. Although many shear zones were reactivated as faults, these are isolated, and offsets are small, suggesting that reactivation occurred only as a side effect of the rifting and that the Kaoko Belt shear zones have not exerted a significant influence on the rift orientation...|$|R
40|$|The {{compositional}} {{structure and}} thermal {{state of the}} subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the Kalahari Craton and the surrounding <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> have been mapped {{in space and time}} using > 3400 garnet xenocrysts from > 50 kimberlites intruded over the period 520 – 80 Ma. The trace-element patterns of many garnets reflect the metasomatic refertilisation of originally highly depleted harzburgites and lherzolites, and much of the lateral and vertical heterogeneity observed in the SCLM within the craton is the product of such metasomatism. The most depleted, and possibly least modified, SCLM was sampled beneath the Limpopo Belt by early Paleozoic kimberlites; the SCLM beneath other parts of the craton may represent similar material modified by metasomatism during Phanerozoic time. In the SW part of the craton, the SCLM sampled by “Group 2 ” kimberlites (> 110 Ma) is thicker, cooler and less metasomatised than that sampled by “Group 1 ” kimberlites (mostly ≤ 95 Ma) in the same area. Therefore, the extensively studied xenolith suite from the Group 1 kimberlites probably is not representative of primary Archean SCLM compositions. The relatively fertile SCLM beneath the <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> surrounding the craton is interpreted as largely Archean SCLM, metasomatised and mixed with younger material during Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic rifting and compression. This implies {{that at least some of}} the observed secular evolution in SCLM composition worldwide may reflect the reworking of Archean SCLM. There are strong correlations between mantle composition and the lateral variations in seismic velocity shown by detailed tomographic studies. Areas of relatively low Vp within the craton largely reflect the progressive refertilisation of the Archean root during episodes of intraplate magmatism, including the Bushveld (2 Ga) and Karroo (ca. 180 Ma) events; areas of high Vp map out the distribution of relatively less metasomatised Archean SCLM. The relatively low Vp of the SCLM beneath the <b>mobile</b> <b>belts</b> around the craton is consistent with its fertile composition. The seismic data may be used to map the lateral extent of different types of SCLM, taking into account the small lateral variations in the geotherm identified using the techniques described here. 27 page(s...|$|R
