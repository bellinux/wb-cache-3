5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E

5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while other species are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also positively phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), while other species are negatively phototactic (<b>move</b> <b>away</b> from bright light). Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, emo's {{popularity}} began to decrease. Some bands <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from their emo roots or disbanded. For example, My Chemical Romance's album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from their emo roots {{in favor of}} a traditional pop punk style. Additionally, Paramore and Fall Out Boy both <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from their emo roots during 2013 with albums like the former's self-titled and the latter's Save Rock and Roll. Moreover, Panic! at the Disco <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from their emo pop roots with albums like Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, moving to a more synthpop style. Also, by this time, many bands associated with the emo genre disbanded, which included bands like My Chemical Romance, Alexisonfire, and Thursday. This has led to arguments regarding the state of emo music.|$|R
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from their natal tree {{in order to}} find figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

The congress also saw the WPK and North Korea <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from orthodox communism by emphasizing the Juche idea over Marxism–Leninism, giving the party a nationalistic bent. The next party congress was not convened before 2016, despite party rules that stipulated that a congress had to be held every fifth year.|$|E
