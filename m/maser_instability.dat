25|$|Saturn is {{the source}} of rather strong low {{frequency}} radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron <b>Maser</b> <b>Instability</b> of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like {{in the case of the}} Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1GW.|$|E
50|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3 MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1 km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3-3 MHz (with wavelengths of 100-1000 m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3-40 MHz (with wavelengths of 10-100 m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io-Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.The majority of these emissions are thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron <b>Maser</b> <b>Instability,</b> which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles.

While we consider only a simple ring distribution in velocity space, because of its tractability, the ideas may point toward understanding the behavior in the presence of more realistic distributions.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the loss cone-driven instabilities in the low solar corona is undertaken. The instabilities considered are the electron cyclotron maser, the whistler, and the electrostatic upper hybrid. It is shown that the first-harmonic extraordinary mode of the electron cyclotron <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> is the fastest growing mode for strong magnetized plasma (the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency being less than 0. 35). For values of the ratio between 0. 35 and 1. 0, the first-harmonic ordinary mode of the electron cyclotron <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> dominates the emission. For ratio values greater than 1. 0, no direct electromagnetic radiation is expected since other instabilities, which do not escape directly, saturate the electron cyclotron maser (the whistler or the electrostatic upper hybrid waves).

40|$|The {{electron}} {{plasma frequency}} ω_pe and electron gyrofrequency Ω_e are two parameters {{that allow us to}} describe the properties of a plasma and to constrain the physical phenomena at play, for instance, whether a <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> develops. In this paper, we aim to show that the <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> can exist in the solar corona. We perform an in-depth analysis of the ω_pe/Ω_e ratio for simple theoretical and complex solar magnetic field configurations. Using the combination of force-free models for the magnetic field and hydrostatic models for the plasma properties, we determine the ratio of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons. For the sake of comparison, we compute the ratio for bipolar magnetic fields containing a twisted flux bundle, and for four different observed active regions. We also study how ω_pe/Ω_e is affected by the potential and non-linear force-free field models. We demonstrate that the ratio of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons can be estimated by this novel method combining magnetic field extrapolation techniques and hydrodynamic models. Even if statistically not significant, values of ω_pe/Ω_e ≤ 1 are present in all examples, and are located in the low corona near to photosphere below one pressure scale-height and/or in the vicinity of twisted flux bundles. The values of ω_pe/Ω_e are lower for non-linear force-free fields than potential fields, thus increasing the possibility of <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> in the corona. From this new approach for estimating ω_pe/Ω_e, we conclude that the electron <b>maser</b> <b>instability</b> can exist in the solar corona above active regions.

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} few devices {{delivering}} output in the sub-millimetre range which exploit the electron cyclotron <b>maser</b> (ECM) <b>instability,</b> due to the expense and technical limitations associated with {{the current level of}} magnet technology. Devices operating within this THz regime could fulfill a variety of potential applications, ranging from plasma diagnostics to emerging biochemical diagnostic spectrometry. Therefore, operation at a harmonic, s, of the electron cyclotron frequency, ωc, is an attractive alternative of attaining such frequencies. However, given that the starting current, Ist, of a high harmonic will usually satisfy the starting criteria of a lower harmonic, this can prove problematic. To that end, a novel resonant cavity has been designed, which realizes co-harmonic generation of second and fourth harmonic resonances. This is achieved through an azimuthal corrugation of the walls of the interaction region, which in turn, allows the frequencies of the two resonances to have an exact integer ratio. Through the use of a specially designed output aperture, the lower harmonic should be effectively trapped within the cavity, facilitating a pure output of the upper harmonic. The 3 -D PIC code MAGIC- 3 D has been used to examine the proposed geometry. Simulations conducted thus far have displayed the intended co-harmonic generation; however, the second harmonic is seen to undergo mode conversion at the output aperture, which in turn, dominates the emitted radiation. The focus of the current research is therefore to address this problem...|$|R
