5|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that fundamental constants such asc {{have the same}} value throughout spacetime, meaning {{that they do not}} depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> over time. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name for the river is unknown but appears to be Pre-English. In Old English the form was Weolud and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> to the Middle English form due to folk-etymology or Scandinavian influence. The Welland (Weolud) is first {{mentioned}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 921AD.|$|E
5|$|Various changes, {{mostly in}} morphology, {{took place between}} Proto-Semitic and Proto-Central-Semitic, the {{language}} {{at the root of}} the Central Semitic languages. The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged, but the emphatic consonants <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> their realization in Central Semitic from ejectives to pharyngealized consonants.|$|E

50|$|Retinitis pigmentosa {{was first}} {{described}} {{in relation to}} the BEST1 gene in 2009 and was found to be associated with four different missense mutations in the BEST1 gene in people.

Macrinus, fearing for his safety, resolved to have Caracalla murdered before he was condemned.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E

5|$|The British seized her in {{an action}} on 25 September 1806, and the Royal Navy took Minerve into service as Alceste in March 1807; Alceste then {{continued}} to serve throughout the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 November 1811, Alceste led a British squadron that captured a French military convoy carrying more than 200 cannon to Trieste in the Balkans. After this loss, Napoleon changed {{the direction of his}} planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia. The British historian James Henderson has suggested that the two events were linked, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the course of the war.|$|E

25|$|In {{his classic}} {{study of the}} Nuer of {{southern}} Sudan, E. E. Evans-Pritchard suggested rinderpest might have affected the Nuer's social organization {{before and during the}} 1930s. Since the Nuer were pastoralists, much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry, and bride-prices were paid in cattle; prices <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> as a result of cattle depletion. Rinderpest might also have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations of {{the shadowy}} Conall mac Taidg are {{determined}} {{largely by the}} shifting views of historians with regard to Caustantín mac Fergusa and the later origins of the Kingdom of Alba, a subject where the consensus <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> {{twice in the last}} few decades having previously been stable since the time of William Forbes Skene. Skene made Conall a king of the Picts, later reinterpretations made him first a king of the Picts, then, following his expulsion by Caustantín, a king in Dál Riata. Recent reinterpretations make him a king in Argyll throughout, but not necessarily the chief king.|$|E

25|$|People {{had come}} to see Moses as a bully who disregarded public input, but until the {{publication}} of Caro's book, they had not known many details of his private life—for instance, that his brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty. Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's favor shortly before her death. Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period and she <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert's subsequent treatment of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.|$|E

25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E
