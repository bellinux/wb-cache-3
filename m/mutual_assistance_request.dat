In other cases, <b>mutual</b> legal <b>assistance</b> <b>requests</b> have not been honored in spite of treaty obligations. There are many examples of cases where international asset recovery would have been possible, if there had been political will. These include: monies in Switzerland frozen that belonged to the former Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and against former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{states have}} {{developed}} mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence {{or other forms}} of legal assistance, such as witness statements or the service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically referred to as requests for “mutual legal assistance."

50|$|Managing {{the stages}} of an asset {{recovery}} investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires {{a great deal of}} resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually {{come in the form of}} a <b>Mutual</b> Legal <b>Assistance</b> <b>request</b> or a letter rogatory, though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.|$|R

40|$|Through the Belfast Project, {{researchers}} {{sponsored by}} Boston College began to compile an oral {{history of the}} period of violent political conflict in Northern Ireland known as “The Troubles” {{in a series of}} interviews. The interviewees’ participation in the project was conditioned on a strict promise of confidentiality. However, when authorities in the United Kingdom became suspicious that the interviews contained evidence of criminal activity, the United Kingdom, pursuant to a <b>Mutual</b> Legal <b>Assistance</b> Treaty, <b>requested</b> the United States to subpoena the materials on its behalf. Satisfaction of the subpoena would mean not only turning over the interview recordings, but also identifying the participants. The lead researches challenged the subpoena, asserting an academic privilege to protect confidential information from compelled disclosure. Through the lens of the Belfast Project controversy, this comment argues that the United States should recognize a constitutional privilege for academic researchers and advocates the reasoning of the European Court of Human Rights when the right to freedom of expression is implicated. Finally, this comment proposes that if the Belfast Project researchers are unsuccessful in both American and European courts, the United States should decline to enforce the United Kingdom’s request because it contravenes public policy and impairs essential American interests...|$|R
