5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch <b>migration</b> <b>process</b> to occur where the strands move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{intensification}} of <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> in Ukraine, as well around the world, {{results from the}} processes of world space globalization. Characteristic features of international migration are a steady increase of its scope involving the population of practically all countries throughout the globe into the international circulation, and {{the rapid growth of}} the intellectual migration share in such circulation. The research on various components of <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> has been presented in both domestic and foreign research scientific literature. Although science has accumulated considerable knowledge of the migration issues, it still has a rough general theoretical and methodological concept of <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> analysis, there is no in-depth statistical analysis of labor <b>migration</b> <b>processes,</b> including insufficient focus on the research on qualified migrant labor potential. The article examines the causes and effects of intellectual migration, defines the main trends of qualified labor migration, outlines the main challenges in the field of intellectual migration and suggests the ways of forming efficient well-balanced state migration policy...|$|R

25|$|The third great wave of {{domestic}} migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53.

Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the <b>migration</b> <b>process</b> on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers. By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.|$|E

About 670,000 route-kilometer (419,000-mile) of optical fibres has been laid in India by the major operators, including in the financially nonviable rural areas and the process continues. Keeping in mind the viability of providing services in rural areas, the government of India also took a proactive role to promote the NGN implementation in the country; an expert committee called NGN eCO was constituted in order to deliberate on the licensing, interconnection and Quality of Service (QoS) issues related to NGN and it submitted its report on 24 August 2007.

40|$|The {{migration}} {{literature has}} identified the various mechanisms explaining why <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> tend to gain their own momentum and become self-perpetuating partly independent {{of their original}} causes and migration policies. In particular the migration-facilitating role of migrant networks has been extensively studied. The current theoretical literature ascribes a pivotal role to networks in explaining the diffusion of migration access within communities and the relatively autonomous continuation of migration. However, current theories on the internal dynamics of <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> are haunted by three fundamental weaknesses. First, {{by focusing on the}} role of social capital in the form of migrant networks in endogenously perpetuating <b>migration</b> <b>processes,</b> they tend to underexpose other internal dynamics of <b>migration</b> <b>processes,</b> and in particular contextual feedback mechanisms at the sending and receiving side. Second, they are unable to explain why these network effects do not always occur, as testified by the much-ignored fact that many initial migration moves do not unleash <b>processes</b> of chain <b>migration.</b> Third, the central argument of conventional migration network theories is largely circular, according to whic...|$|R

25|$|These divides {{can also}} occur {{between members of}} the same generation, {{particularly}} between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to set a good example for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age {{are less likely to be}} accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The <b>migration</b> <b>process</b> can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies. Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or {{members of the same}} generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family.|$|E

[...] In addition, reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as deoxyribozymes and ribozymes, which can perform chemical reactions, and aptamers, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.|$|E

The paper gives theoretical calculation of heat transfer and humidity <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> in autoclaved aerated concrete walls as well as based on practical measurements. Analyzing experimental data, the model for heat transfer and humidity <b>migration</b> <b>processes</b> in walls made from autoclaved aerated concrete blocks was created and tested.

2500|$|Neural crest cell {{migration}} {{occurs in a}} rostral to caudal direction without the need of a neuronal scaffold such as along a radial glial cell. For this reason the crest cell <b>migration</b> <b>process</b> is termed “free migration”. Instead of scaffolding on progenitor cells, neural crest migration {{is the result of}} repulsive guidance via EphB/EphrinB and semaphorin/neuropilin [...] signaling, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and contact inhibition with one another. While Ephrin and Eph proteins have the capacity to undergo bi-directional signaling, neural crest cell repulsion employs predominantly forward signaling to initiate a response within the receptor bearing neural crest cell. Burgeoning neural crest cells express EphB, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds the EphrinB transmembrane ligand expressed in the caudal half of each somite. When these two domains interact it causes receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of rhoGTPases, and eventual cytoskeletal rearrangements within the crest cells inducing them to repel. This phenomenon allows neural crest cells to funnel through the rostral portion of each somite.|$|E
