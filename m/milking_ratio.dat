30|$|In {{comparison}} with milk production, the variation of milk fat content is relatively small. Thus, the <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio</b> resembles the reciprocal of milk production, {{as shown in}} Equation (1). This fact vindicates an empirical finding by Wood (1976). Of course, there is a variety of choices of which indicator to use for management, and it is absolutely the farm’s choice. If the <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio</b> tends to be preferable, the six different scenarios leading to {{a variation of the}} <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio</b> provide useful indications for management planning strategies. Although management actions to reduce the negative effects of heat cannot be applied to each individual within a large production system (André et al. 2011), our present analysis highlights only six different required treatment strategies. Further, these may be reduced to the three major cases shown in Figure 3. Appropriate management action can be taken regarding feed composition and the prioritised allocation of cows in the barn. For Case 2, in which the production of milk and milk fat increase, no special treatment is actually required despite a decrease in the <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio.</b> The reason for this is the faster increase of milk production compared to that of milk fat yield. For Case 5, cows are strongly affected by heat, but the <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio</b> increases. The decreased production of milk and milk fat may be offset by allocating the cows as cool a space as possible and providing them with easily digestible and high-calorie feed. For Case 1, the decreased production of milk fat may be offset by providing cows with a fat-productive feed.|$|R

In order to investigate further the prevalence of subclinical breast inflammation and {{to assess the impact of}} dietary intervention, we studied rural Tanzanian women taking part in a study of dietary sunflower or red palm oil supplementation during late pregnancy and lactation. We measured breastmilk concentrations of IL- 8, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β 2 (TGF-β) and the ratio of sodium to potassium. We also estimated systemic inflammation by plasma concentrations of the acute phase proteins, α 1 -acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein. There were highly significant intercorrelations among <b>milk</b> Na/K <b>ratio</b> and concentrations of IL- 8 and TGF-β, the last only after treatment with bile salts which also improved TGF-β recovery in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Diets were a control with no supplements or supplemented with either 2. 5, or 5. 0 g/head/d rumenprotected methionine. The experiment started exactly after kidding and lasted for 60 days thereafter. Production variables studied were milk production, milk composition, body weights, feed intake, kids weaning weight, and milk fatty acids. Daily milk production and energy corrected milk were not affected by protected me thionine supplementation. Milk Percentages of fat, protein, total solids, and casein were also not affected by protected methionine supplementation. Likewise, fat and protein yields were not different among dietary treatments of protected methionine. No differences in milk fatty acids composition were observed by supplementing rumen protected methionine in the experiment.

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the incidence of cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cows was related to milk production parameters (milk yield, milk fat and protein) in early lactation with special emphasis on the negative energy balance (NEB). The diagnosis of COD was made by rectal palpation performed by veterinarians experienced in gynaecology. Data used for this field study were collected from November 1986 onwards. The dataset consisted of 6911 lactations (3891 cows) on 29 herds including 600 cases of COD (8. 7 %). Lactations in the COD group had higher average maximum productions of milk, energy corrected milk, milk fat and protein than lactations in the non-COD group. The average maximum <b>milk</b> fat:protein <b>ratio</b> did not significantly differ between the groups. Daily changes of the average maximum milk fat and protein percentage and of total milk fat and protein yield were calculated and divided into four groups depending on the day of first milk recording. No significant relations were found between changes in milk fat and protein percentage and total milk fat and protein yield, and the incidence of COD. It is concluded that elevated average peak milk yield, milk fat and protein yield in early lactation are risk factors for the incidence of COD, but the average <b>milk</b> fat:protein <b>ratio</b> is not. In this field study changes in milk fat percentage and milk fat yield, indicative for the presence of NEB, did not show a relation with the incidence of COD in early lactating cows.

Protein and fat contents were kept constant {{by adjusting the}} recipes with skim-milk powder and fresh cream. Emulsions were prepared by high-pressure homogenization and whipped on a pilot plant. Particle-size distribution determined by laser-light scattering showed an extensive aggregation of fat globules in both mix and whipped emulsions, regardless of recipe.

A grass silage-based diet was formulated so that treatments were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and contained 100 and 110 % {{of energy and}} protein requirements according to INRA (1989). The WBGRa {{was measured by the}} [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose dilution technique, and mammary glucose balance by arteriovenous differences and blood flow measurements. Duodenal glucose infusion increased arterial glucose concentrations linearly, whereas arterial concentrations of insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon were not changed. The WBGRa increased linearly with increasing glucose loads. The increase represented 42 % of the intestinal glucose supplement. Mammary blood flow dramatically increased (up to 45 %) and was associated with a significant increase of arterial insulin-like growth factor- 1 concentrations. Mammary gland rate of glucose disappearance ([6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose measurement) increased linearly, whereas net mammary balance of glucose, lactose, and milk yields increased quadratically. Net mammary balance of glucose accounted for 60 % of WBGRa, except for the greatest dose (47. 6 %). The decrease in milk yield with 2398 g/d of glucose may be explained by an imbalance in intracellular intermediate concentrations.

An efflux technique was used to determine the average intracellular sodium of 23. 0 +/- 1. 2 mumol/g tissue (+/- S. E. of mean). The intracellular potassium, determined by calculating the amount of potassium contained in both the interstitial and milk spaces and subtracting these values from the total tissue potassium, was 62 +/- 1 mumol/g tissue. The mean intracellular potassium to sodium ratio, calculated from individual efflux experiments, was 2. 7 +/- 0. 2.

In breast <b>milk,</b> the <b>ratio</b> of DHA to arachidonic acid (AA) was consistent with those observed in other high fish-eating populations. Overall the data suggest that high exposure to LCPUFAs from habitual fish consumption does not prevent the documented decrease in LCPUFA status in pregnancy that occurs as a result of foetal accretion in the third trimester of pregnancy. <br /...|$|R
30|$|Milk {{yield and}} its {{composition}} {{vary according to}} individual cows {{as well as to}} a variety of different environment conditions, such as temperature. Previous studies suggest that heat exerts considerable negative effects on milk production and its composition, especially during summer months. We investigate the production and fat composition of milk from individual dairy cows and develop a modelling framework that investigates the effect of temperature by extending a traditional lactation curve model onto a more flexible statistical modelling framework, a generalised additive model (GAM). The GAM simultaneously copes with multiple different conditions (temperature, parity, days of lactation, etc.), and, importantly, their non-linear relationships. Our analysis of retrospective data suggests that individual cows respond differently to heat; cows producing relatively high quantities of milk tend to be particularly sensitive to heat. Our model also suggests that most dairy cows studied fall into three distinct cases that underpin the variation of the <b>milk</b> fat <b>ratio</b> by different mechanisms.|$|R
