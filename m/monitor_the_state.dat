25|$|After the harbour pilot {{had left}} the ship the {{combination}} turned southwest and headed towards the Kvarken in heavy head seas. To prevent water splashing over the forecastle and wetting the cargo only one main engine was running and the ship made headway at only four knots. When Finn-Baltic passed the Ulkokalla lighthouse, the second main engine was turned on to improve the maneuverability of the vessel, increasing its speed to around six knots. However, this also increased {{the amount of water}} entering the cargo hold every time the bow slammed to a wave and the watch officer, who used searchlights to <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the cargo, noticed that more ore heaps had collapsed. Later in the evening the combination passed the lighthouse and pilot station of Tankar, and the wind seemed to calm down.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 June 2012 TEPCO {{reported}} that another thermometer had malfunctioned, resulting {{in more than}} half of the temperature sensors, 23 out of 41, now being out of use in reactor No. 2., thus making it more problematic to <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of [...] "cold-shutdown". According to TEPCO, the high humidity in the reactor may be a contributing factor in the failure of the sensors. TEPCO stated that it is currently decontaminating the site and training workers to install new thermometers. [...] The plan is to install new thermometers through pipes that are connected to the reactor. TEPCO stated that it plans to decontaminate the site and install the new thermometers by late July 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{only one}} of the temperature-sensors showed {{fluctuating}} readings between 70°C and 90°C, TEPCO and NISA thought this sensor was malfunctioning. The sensor works on the principle of changing resistance between the surface of two different metals as the temperature changes. TEPCO planned measurements on this sensor. Since the radiation around reactor 2 could make it impossible to place new sensors inside the reactor vessel, the situation would become very serious if the other two sensors inside the reactor were to also fail. After that, {{it would be impossible to}} monitor the reactor. Kazuhiko Kudo, a professor of nuclear engineering at the university of Kyushu, Japan commented: [...] "Because we haven't been able to grasp how the nuclear fuel in the cores has been distributed, it's impossible to rule out localized high temperature spots. As the high radiation rules out installing new temperature sensors, if the last two sensors fail, the situation will be much more serious indeed." [...] On 26 February, TEPCO sent a report to the Japanese government about the malfunctioning temperature-sensors and has since ceased monitoring that sensor. The other two temperature-sensors and the radiation levels inside the containment vessel would be used to <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the cold shutdown. The amount of cooling water would be lowered, after NISA's approval.|$|E
