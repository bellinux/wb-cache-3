5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the <b>matter.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E

25|$|Each curve may {{pass through}} itself during this motion, {{but the two}} curves must remain {{separated}} throughout. This is formalized as regular homotopy, which further requires that each curve be an immersion, not just any map. However, this added condition {{does not change the}} definition of linking number (it does not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> curves are required to always be immersions or not), which is an example of an h-principle (homotopy-principle), meaning that geometry reduces to topology.|$|E

25|$|In a gas {{with massive}} {{particles}}, {{the energy of}} the particles is distributed according to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. This distribution is established as the particles collide with each other, exchanging energy (and momentum) in the process. In a photon gas, there will also be an equilibrium distribution, but photons do not collide with each other (except under very extreme conditions, see two-photon physics), so the equilibrium distribution must be established by other means. The most common way that an equilibrium distribution is established is by the interaction of the photons with <b>matter.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> photons are absorbed and emitted by the walls of the system containing the photon gas, and the walls are at a particular temperature, then the equilibrium distribution for the photons will be a black body distribution at that temperature.|$|E
25|$|A {{partnership}} reneges {{on their}} contract if they violate {{the rules of}} play; most often this happens when a player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional tricks to do so. It does not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the first hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the false accusation is penalized the three-trick penalty. The tricks do not count towards opponents bid.|$|E
25|$|Consensual sexual {{intercourse}} over the 3-year age difference (where the minor is 13 to 15 years old) would subject the older party to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 2nd Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-71(a)(1). Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to be tried as an adult. See C.G.S. §46b-127(a). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class B felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 9 months and maximum 20 years imprisonment. It would not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> older person {{did not know of}} the age difference, or if the younger person lied about age. However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted. See C.G.S. §54-76b to o.|$|E

25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of food consumed by brachiopods is digestible, {{with very little}} solid waste produced. The cilia of the lophophore can change direction to eject isolated particles of indigestible <b>matter.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> animal encounters larger lumps of undesired matter, the cilia lining the entry channels pause and the tentacles {{in contact with the}} lumps move apart to form large gaps and then slowly use their cilia to dump the lumps onto the lining of the mantle. This has its own cilia, which wash the lumps out through the opening [...] between the valves. If the lophophore is clogged, the adductors snap the valves sharply, which creates a [...] "sneeze" [...] that clears the obstructions. In some inarticulate brachiopods the digestive tract is U-shaped and ends with an anus that eliminates solids {{from the front of the}} body wall. Other inarticulate brachiopods and all articulate brachiopods have a curved gut that ends blindly, with no anus. These animals bundle solid waste with mucus and periodically [...] "sneeze" [...] it out, using sharp contractions of the gut muscles.|$|E

The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at , four knots faster than their current attainable speed.
