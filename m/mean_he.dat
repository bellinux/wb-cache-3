Later, to Jon's {{disappointment}} and anger, he is told he has been assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, like his uncle. Jon suspects Ser Alliser Thorne's involvement, as revenge for Jon defying him; however, Sam believes that this assignment may <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> is being groomed for command. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a heart tree, Jon's direwolf brings him a dismembered hand.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the size}} of the Austrian force {{approaching}} him, Ney planned to withdraw to Winterthur. Before he could implement this action, the over-all commander of the forward line, Jean Victor Tharreau, had galloped to his position and said he would support Ney by sending Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division; Ney understood this to <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was to make a stand along the entire outpost line, and {{that he would not be}} isolated. His small force would receive reinforcements from Soult's division. Consequently, Ney directed the weakest brigade, under the command of Gazan, to move up a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another brigade, under the command of Roget, to take the right, preventing any Austrian flanking manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|In Ian Fleming's stories, James Bond {{is in his}} mid-to-late thirties, {{but does}} not age. In Moonraker, he admits to being eight years shy of {{mandatory}} retirement age from the 00 section—45—which would <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was 37 at the time. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives him a birth date of 11 November 1920, while a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921. According to Griswold, the Fleming novels take place between around May 1951, to February 1964, by which time Bond was aged 42.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2016, Billboard {{reported}} that Five Finger Death Punch's record label Prospect Park had {{filed a lawsuit}} against the band on April 21, 2016 for breaching their contract. The basis of the claim cites that the band began working on a new album without Prospect Park's consent and will be working with Rise Records. In a recent interview, vocalist Ivan Moody has said he will be completing the current tour and leave the band at the end of 2017. The next day however, an announcement was published on the official site of FFDP, where it was revealed, that rumours about Ivan's departure are false. According to the announcement, the vocalist plans to start a side project beside Five Finger Death Punch, which does not <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> has plans on leaving.|$|E
5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried {{stories on the}} battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E

5|$|The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments {{posted on}} the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, {{captured}} the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward {{a gap in the}} Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers {{in this part of the}} line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.|$|E
