5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency {{is associated with}} obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5000|$|The only hadith that {{unequivocally}} {{states that}} women <b>may</b> not <b>lead</b> mixed congregations is Ibn Majah (Kitab iqamat is-salat was-sunnati fiha) #1134, narrated through Jabir ibn Abdullah: [...] "A woman <b>may</b> not <b>lead</b> {{a man in}} Prayer, nor <b>may</b> a Bedouin <b>lead</b> a believer of the Muhajirun or a corrupt person lead a committed Muslim in Prayer." ...|$|R
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (weakness of {{the heart}} muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson's disease; it <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|Imipramine and {{desipramine}} {{have been}} reported increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets.

5|$|In simplistic terms, the NS-10 {{possesses}} sonic {{characteristics that}} allow record producers {{to assume that}} if a recording sounds good on these monitors, then it should sound good on most playback systems.

5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Titania's orbit lies {{completely}} {{inside the}} Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet.

5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
