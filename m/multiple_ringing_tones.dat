Despite the technology having been used with great success in remote areas of Canada, it proved to be unsuitable in a British urban setting. In particular the technology used spectrum at 3.5 GHz, which limited line-of-sight range to the base station and was narrowband, which meant it could not provide broadband Internet access.|$|E

[...] However, with snippets of existing songs and compositions generating more than $2 billion in annual worldwide revenues in 2005 as <b>ring</b> <b>tones,</b> cell phone handset manufacturers began producing handsets capable of replaying {{the upper and lower}} notes from a song's melody without tinny-sounding bleats.

40|$|Abstract:- Custom <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> for {{cellular}} phones have become extremely popular {{over the past}} several years, allowing users to customize their mobile computing experience, expressing their personality or enjoying their favorite tune. In the <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> selection process, a user generally searches or browses for a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> by title in one of several <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> databases and then purchases his selection. Research into query-by-humming systems may eventually enable users to select a song by singing a segment of it. This project, Sing-a-Ring, extends the user <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> experience by allowing users to create their own <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> by singing. Unlike current options to record a sound file and set that as a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> directly, this application uses an autocorrelation algorithm to convert the recorded sample to a MIDI file and then provides customization options, such as instrument and tempo selectors. This application is implemented on the Java ™ 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J 2 ME), and has been tested on a Motorola RAZR V 3 i phone. For the current implementation, due to format conversion issues, recordings must be created on a computer and then transferred to the phone. Nevertheless, the current application is a proof of concept with great potential, especially if access to AMR decoding libraries and the digital signal processing chip is available...|$|R

40|$|The LT® 1684 is a {{telecommunication}} <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> generator. The IC takes a user-generated {{pulse width}} modulated (PWM) input and converts it {{to a high}} voltage sine wave suitable for telephone ringing applications. The LT 1684 receives capacitor-isolated differential PWM input signals encoded with desired ring output cadence, frequency, and amplitude information. The LT 1684 nor-malizes the pulse amplitude to – 1. 25 V for an accurate signal voltage reference. The cadence, frequency and amplitude information is extracted using a multiple-pole active filter/amplifier, producing the output <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> signal. The LT 1684 uses its own <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> output as a reference for generating local supply rails using complementary high voltage external MOSFETs as dynamic level-shifting devices.
