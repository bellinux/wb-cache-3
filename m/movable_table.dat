5000|$|Keyseaters, {{also known}} as keyseating {{machines}} and keyway cutters, are specialized machines designed to cut keyways.

Another difference is a keyseater has a guiding system above the workpiece to minimize deflection, which results in a closer tolerance cut. The process starts by clamping the workpiece to the table with a fixture or vise. The workpiece is properly located and then the reciprocating arm is started. Some models have a stationary table so the cutter is fed horizontally into the workpiece, while others have a <b>movable</b> <b>table</b> that feeds the workpiece into a fixed cutter.

40|$|Experiments using a plastic-moderated {{assembly}} as a {{radiation source}} are described, and the hazards attendant to these experiments are evaluated. The critical assembly, designated Battelle's Plastic Reactor Facility, is {{constructed in the}} form of a cube. A portion of the plastic and fuel will be removed from the center of this reactor to provide a radiation environment for exposing fission-chamber devices. This central void region will approximate a flux trap in which a bigh neutron-to-gamma ratio is expected. The fuel-element assemblies are composed of strips of aluminum and Teflon-coated uranium sandwiched with plastic and encased in aluminum boxes. One portion of the core is on a <b>movable</b> <b>table,</b> while the other part is on a fixed table. The core is assembled remotely by driving the <b>movable</b> <b>table</b> against the fixed table. Primary control and safety of the assembly are achieved by insenting or withdrawing regulating and safety elements and by increasing or decreasing the distance between the two core halves. For safety, the maximum normal rate of reactivity addition has been limited to 0. 04 % DELTA k/k per sec for control-element withdrawal and table closure. The system is interlocked so that only one control element can be withdrawn at a time and so that the <b>movable</b> <b>table</b> and elements cannot be moved simultaneously. In addition, criticality cannot be reached by only moving the tables together. No experiments with the Plastic Reactor Facility are planned since it will serve only as a source of radiation operating at a constant power level. Consequently, the hazards of a nuclear excursion are minimized. However, the safety aspects of the operations and possible power excursions have been analyzed. The analysis indicates that these operations present no significant hazard to the public persons or operating staff. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Conveyor belt {{cropping}} is a cropping principal that {{is characterized}} by the plants being placed in one end of the cropping area and then transported along it throughout their development. When they reach the end of the cropping area, they are fully grown and ready for harvesting. Along the cropping area there are areas where work with the plants is done. There are several advantages in using such a system. The work environment is better because the climate can be adjusted to the wishes {{of the people in the}} work areas and because individual aids can be installed. The labour requirement is reduced because work that was done earlier is no longer required and work efficiency increases thanks to the improved climate. The utilization of the cropping area increases when <b>movable</b> <b>tables</b> are installed instead of rolling tables and because there are possibilities to space plants gradually. Since the movable cropping areas with plants is one single unit, the need of transport in the firm is reduced. Some transport inputs can be omitted. The work organization is simplified because there are fewer plants in the same size category and since the batches are more numerous. This enables the usual working peaks, for instance at harvest, to be avoided. A continuous production is achieved which makes the grower less sensitive to temporary price changes in the plants grown and decreases the losses when the crop is changed. The biological advantages are that the cropping area can be split in different climates and that the climate can be adjusted to the stage of plant development. There are some requirements for conveyor belt cropping: - Uniformity in the development of plants. - The harvest time must be quite short. - Cropping areas must be movable and there must be transport equipment to move the areas. To get uniformity in development and a short harvest time the cropping must be close to the biological optimum. Therefore only one kind of plant should be present on the cropping area at the same time. This is because few crops have the same demands on environment. The plants must be genetically defined and free from diseases. During the winter the cropping will be run with inputs of carbon dioxide and illumination. Conveyor belt cropping is especially suited to crops which react uniformly to management inputs, for example in order to initiate flowering. Chrysanthemum belongs to these. Other suitable crops for conveyor belt cropping are plants with only vegetative development, for example lettuce and Hedera. To optimize the use of the cropping area a production plan ought to be prepared which considers the variation in cropping time during the year. Because the plants are moved during the cropping and the cropping time varies with radiation, the empty space after harvest can not always be filled up. A model capable of optimization will calculate how many plants are needed in the cropping area for maximum utilization. Crops with short harvest time and with slight variation in cropping time during the year are the ones best suited to conveyor belt cropping. The report ends with a description of the cropping, equipment and production planning at some growers. When better models of cropping and development are available, the possibilities to controll the crops will increase and more kinds of plants will become suitable for conveyor belt cropping. There are also good opportunities to automate the cropping system to reduce human labour inputs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} is {{evaluation of a}} traditionally designed operating room using simulation of various surgical workflows. Background: A literature search showed {{that there is no}} evidence for an optimal operating room layout regarding the position and size of an ultraclean ventilation (UCV) canopy with a separate preparation room for laying out instruments and in which patients are induced in the operating room itself. Neither was literature found reporting on process simulation being used for this application. Many technical guidelines and designs have mainly evolved over time, and there is no evidence on whether the proposed measures are also effective for the optimization of the layout for workflows. Methods: The study was conducted by applying observational techniques to simulated typical surgical procedures. Process simulations which included complete surgical teams and equipment required for the intervention were carried out for four typical interventions. Four observers used a form to record conflicts with the clean area boundaries and the height of the supply bridge. Preferences for particular layouts were discussed with the surgical team after each simulated procedure. Results: We established that a clean area measuring 3 × 3 m and a supply bridge height of 2. 05 m was satisfactory for most situations, provided a <b>movable</b> operation <b>table</b> is used. The only cases in which conflicts with the supply bridge were observed were during the use of a surgical robot (Da Vinci) and a surgical microscope. During multiple trauma interventions, bottlenecks regarding the dimensions of the clean area will probably arise. Conclusions: The process simulation of four typical interventions has led to significantly different operating room layouts than were arrived at through the traditional design process.

40|$|As robots become {{increasingly}} available and capable, {{there has been}} an increased interest in having robots continue to perform autonomously over time despite changes in their environment. This thesis introduces several algorithms for localization of autonomous mobile robots in real human environments with the goal of having them autonomously deployed over extended periods of time. Monte Carlo Localization with Sampling-Importance Resampling (MCL-SIR) is commonly used for indoor mobile robot localization, with the frequently prescribed suggestion of increasing the number of particles to increase accuracy or robustness. Furthermore, most variants of MCL-SIR sample from the odometry model of a robot, which are far less accurate than modern range sensors. We address both these challenges by introducing Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR), which, instead of relying on more particles, does more with fewer particles. In particular, it uses the analytically computed state space derivatives of the observation likelihood function to refine the proposal distribution, thus improving the accuracy as well as robustness while requiring fewer particles than MCL-SIR. For robots equipped only with inexpensive depth cameras, we introduce the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering algorithm to extract dominant planar features from observed depth images, to use with CGR. Going beyond MCL, we recognize that human environments have objects that are either permanent, like walls, <b>movable,</b> like <b>tables</b> and chairs, or moving, like humans. We introduce Episodic non-Markov Localization, which reasons about the nature of such observations, and accounts for correlations between observations even if they are of unmapped objects, to provide location estimates that are accurate globally with respect to the long-term features, as well as locally, with respect to the short-term features. By examining the short-term features detected by the robot over multiple deployments, the robot is further able to build a Model-Instance map of its environment, reasoning about the shapes or models of common movable objects separately from the specific occurrences or instances. We extensively demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the localization algorithms introduced in this thesis over a “ 1000 km Challenge”: to deploy a team of robots, over multiple floors of multiple buildings, spanning a duration of a few years. We present quantitative and qualitative results from the 1000 km Challenge, and the data collected in the process...|$|R
