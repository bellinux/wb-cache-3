50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in the spring, and {{courtship}} consists of the males performing a sort of dance to attract the females' attention. Females lay clutches of four to 12 eggs in a <b>moist</b> <b>area,</b> which she guards, often neglecting food for the period until they hatch. Hatchlings emerge from the eggs in about three months, having no aquatic stage, like many other salamander species. They instead develop directly into their entirely terrestrial adult form. Maturity is not reached for two to three years.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the Mount Graham red {{squirrel}} inhabited about 11750 acre of spruce-fir, mixed-conifer and ecotone zone habitats that were generally at higher elevations throughout the Pinaleño Mountains. Recent data {{shows that it}} occurs more frequently at the ecotone zone than the other habitats. When choosing a potential nesting site, the squirrels typically pick a cool, <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> {{with an abundance of}} food sources.

5000|$|In some West Germanic {{languages}} cognate {{words of}} a different etymology exist, e.g. ooievaar in Dutch. They originate from *uda-faro, uda being related to water meaning something like swamp or <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> and faro being related to fare; so *uda-faro is something like he who walks in the swamp. In later times this name got reanalysed as *ōdaboro, ōda [...] "fortune, wealth" [...] + boro [...] "bearer" [...] meaning he who brings wealth adding to the myth of storks as maintainers of welfare and bringers of children.|$|E
40|$|Legionella-contaminated {{hot water}} systems and <b>moist</b> {{sanitary}} <b>areas</b> in six hospitals were sampled for amoebae by following a standardized collection protocol. Genus identifications and temperature tolerance determinations were made. Amoebae identified as Hartmannella vermiformis (65 %), Echinamoebae spp. (15 %), Saccamoebae spp. (12 %), and Vahlkampfia spp. (9 %) were detected in 29 of 56 (52 %) hot water samples. Twenty-three of 49 (47 %) swabs obtained from <b>moist</b> <b>areas</b> were amoeba positive. The following genera were identified: Acanthamoeba (22 %), Naegleria (22 %), Vahlkampfia (20 %), Hartmannella (15 %), and Vanella (7 %). The temperature tolerance of amoebae from hot water systems was strikingly {{different from that}} of amoebae from <b>moist</b> <b>areas.</b> At 44 °C on agar, 59 % of amoebic isolates sampled from hot water systems showed growth.

50|$|Having {{reached a}} {{suitable}} <b>moist</b> <b>area,</b> the crabs begin to feed rapidly, working transversely across the beach {{as they do}} so. Feeding comprises raising scoops of sand to the mouthparts, with inedible material accumulating {{at the base of}} the third maxillipeds, and drop off the crabs as round pellets. Feeding may last 1-2.5 hours, with the crabs spending less and less time feeding as they aggregate into armies. The armies are generally composed solely of males, with the largest individuals at the front, probably because their longer legs mean they walk faster. The army as a whole progresses at a speed of 10 yards per minute (0.34 mph), continuing for 0.5-2 hours.|$|E

50|$|External {{fertilization}} is a male organism’s sperm fertilizing {{a female}} organism’s egg {{outside of the}} female’s body.Internal fertilization, on the other hand, is the occurrence of internal insemination as the mode of combining sperm and egg. External fertilization occurs in water or a <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> because it gives the sperm external mobility {{to get to the}} egg. While in the water, the sperm and ova can shed simultaneously to fertilize the egg. The release of eggs and sperm into the water is known as spawning. When females spawn, they release a batch of eggs into a spot of their choice or just into the water, as in bottom dwelling or sessile species and all of the males start to release sperm that are in close proximity. Within vertebrates, it is the amphibians and fish that use external fertilization. When it comes to invertebrates, most are benthic, sessile, or benthic sessile combined animals such as coral, sea anemones, and tube dwelling polychaetes. The benthic zone is the lowest level of the ocean where organisms called benthos reside. An organism that is sessile does not have the ability to move or be mobile. Benthic marine plants such as algae also go through external fertilization to reproduce. Overall, environmental factors and the timing have a heavy influence over the success of external fertilization.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{temperature}} and CO 2 concentrations can alter tritrophic interactions in ecosystems, but {{the impact of}} increasingly severe drought on such interactions is not well understood. We examined the response of a wheat-aphid-parasitoid system to variation in water-deficit stress levels. Our results showed that arid area clones of the aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), tended to have longer developmental times compared to semiarid and <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> clones, {{and the development of}} S. avenae clones tended to be slower with increasing levels of water-deficit. Body sizes of S. avenae clones from all areas decreased with increasing water-deficit levels, indicating their declining adaptation potential under drought. Compared to arid area clones, <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> clones of S. avenae had a higher frequency of backing under severe water stress only, but a higher frequency of kicking under well-watered conditions only, suggesting a water-deficit level dependent pattern of resistance against the parasitoid, Aphidius gifuensis (Ashmead). The number of S. avenae individuals attacked by the parasitoid in 10 min showed a tendency to decrease with increasing water-deficit levels. Clones of S. avenae tended to have lower parasitism rates under treatments with higher water-deficit levels. The development of the parasitoid tended to be slower under higher levels of water-deficit stress. Thus, the bottom-up effects of water-deficit stressed plants were negative on S. avenae. However, the top-down effects via parasitoids were compromised by water-deficit, which could favor the growth of aphid populations. Overall, the first trophic level under water-deficit stress was shown to have an indirect and negative impact on the third trophic level parasitoid, suggesting that parasitoids could be increasingly vulnerable in future warming scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{break-up}} of the Antarctic vortex on the water vapor distribution are studied using MLS measurements of water vapor made during September 1991 and November 1991. In early November at 22 hPa a <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> is found within the polar vortex, consistent with an observed descent of order 10 km and strong radiative cooling. As the vortex erodes (beginning of November 1991), parcels of moist air become detached {{from the edge of}} the vortex and mix rapidly (within 2 - 3 days) with drier mid-latitude air. When the vortex breaks up (mid-November), larger parcels of moist air from both the edge and the inner vortex migrate to mid-latitudes. These parcels have a longer lifetime than those produced by vortex erosion, probably because they are correlated with higher potential vorticity gradients. The break-up of the vortex is accompanied by a mean adiabatic equatorward transport resulting in a significant increase in midstratospheric water vapor values at mid-latitudes in late spring...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in paper converting {{is caused by the}} occurrence of "baggy webs", which essentially is when the tension profile of the paper web is uneven. In an area with low tension the paper is longer, which results in bagginess. The baggy parts can not usually be stretched to even out the tension of the paper web in a converting machine, with the result that runnability problems are likely to occur. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to investigate three particular stages in papermaking, namely drying, calendering and storage, and rank them according to their propensity for inducing baggy webs. The focus was placed on investigating the effects of uneven moisture and grammage profiles on the machine-direction strain difference profile. The largest strain difference occurred when there were systematic thick streaks throughout a reel that formed ridges. Stress relaxation during storage then gave rise to a difference in strain of 0. 14 % when the ridge height was around 2 - 3 mm. Thickness variations due to variations in grammage is also a source of moisture variation. A difference in moisture of 5 % in the calendering stage resulted in strain differences of about 0. 05 - 0. 08 %. These strain differences resulted in creases being formed as early on as in the calender nip when differences in both grammage and moisture content were present. Most creases appeared when the moisture difference was 2 - 8 %. The difference in grammage could be large without creases being formed when no differences in moisture content were present. A moisture difference of about 5 - 6 % during drying resulted in a strain difference of 0. 1 % measured on isotropic samples. The <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> turned into a tight streak when the moisture difference appeared at moisture contents higher than 25 %. At moisture contents lower than 20 %, on the contrary, the <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> turned into a slack streak. The conclusion drawn is that papermakers should concentrate first and foremost on eliminating variations in grammage, especially if these are systematic. This would also eliminate some variations in moisture content, which would solve more problems...|$|E
40|$|New data {{products}} {{are available from}} the CERES instrument, a part of the NASA Earth Observing System. The Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) product combines radiative fluxes with extensive information on the cloud conditions in the footprint, which are retrieved using the co-orbiting imager instrument. These data have been analyzed to more accurately define the radiative properties for the various regions of the recently-proposed adaptive infrared Iris. A variety of ways of defining the cloudy moist region were examined. According to CERES, the net radiative flux for the cloudy moist region ranges between 28 and 54 W/m 2 depending on the specific definition used. This is in contrast to the value of 123 W/m 2 which was somewhat subjectively assigned by LCH. This simple model may miss many feedbacks in the climate system, but it should provide a rough range of the climate variations if the physics of the Iris is correct. There is some question whether the change in cloudy <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> with cloud-weighted SST actually represents a useful quantity, and whether extrapolating it from a regional variation to a global response to warmer climate is appropriate. Regardless, the current results show that the proposed Iris feedback is very much weaker when objectively-determined radiative properties are used in the model...|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the paper {{analyzed}} the surface latent heat flux (SLHF) variations for five inland earthquakes occurred in some lake area, <b>moist</b> <b>area</b> and arid area of China during recent years. We used the SLHF daily and monthly data to differentiate the global and seasonal variability from the transient local anomalies. The temporal scale of the observed variations is 1 – 2 months {{before and after the}} earthquakes, and spatial scale is about 10 °× 10 °. The result suggests that the SLHFs adjacent the epicenters all are anomalous high value (>μ+ 2 σ) 8 – 30 days before the shocks as compared with past several years of data. Different from the abnormal meteorological phenomenon, the distribution of the anomalies was isolated and local, which usually occurred in the epicenter and its adjacent area, or along the fault lines. The increase of SLHF was tightly related with the season which the earthquake occurs in; the maximal (125 W/m 2, Pu’er earthquake) and minimal (25 W/m 2, Gaize earthquake) anomalies were in summer and winter, respectively. The abundant surface water and groundwater in the epicenter and its adjacent region can provide necessary condition for the change of SLHF. To further confirm the reliability of SLHF anomaly, it is necessary to explore its physical mechanism in depth by more earthquake cases...|$|E
