40|$|Leadership in {{mediating}} multi-party {{matters is}} imperative. In my work as Claims Administrator {{for one of}} the largest ever personal injury/bankruptcy settlements ($ 2. 3 billion, net present value), I am charged with four primary areas of responsibility: (1) the efficient and fair evaluation of claims consistent with provisions of the Joint Plan of Reorganization; (2) the efficient delivery of payments to all approved claimants pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Plan; (3) the <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>custody</b> of the assets paid to the Settlement Facility; and finally (4) the faithful execution of the provisions of the Joint Plan in all respects. In my daily work I must mediate (and arbitrate) but, most important, I must LEAD. When I assumed my present position, I identified several important skills I felt a Claims Administrator needed. The skills I have identified as core competencies for this position are the same leadership skills that must be considered by mediators in multi-party mediation - dealing with ambiguity, business or industry knowledge, conflict management, ethics and values, organizing, managing and measuring work, building effective teams, written and oral communications, process management, patience, perseverance and managerial courage...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The Global Transactions Services (GTS) {{business}} unit was established alongside the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) brand reporting into a Corporate and Investment Banking Board. GTS has been mandated to deliver global cash <b>management,</b> trade <b>and</b> <b>custody</b> services <b>and</b> account services to large corporates in the jurisdictions where FirstRand operates. Technology advances in centralising operating structures, {{have made it}} possible for GTS to centralise back office operations to a few locations within the country as witnessed by Global banks like Citigroup. The research problem therefore was to evaluate and identify the strengths as well as shortfalls of the current decentralised operating model versus a proposed approach towards a centralised operating model within the GTS {{business unit}}; focusing on investigating whether outsourcing IT operations and technology would create efficiencies, attract skilled employees and technological advancement to the division. Primary objective of the research was to evaluate the current decentralised operating model. Secondary objective was to evaluate the gains associated with implementing a central operating model against the gains currently derived from the decentralised operating model. The findings derived from the study suggest that: (i) There is a misalignment between the business strategy and IT strategy within the current operating model resulting in IT playing a supporting role and not an enabling role in the business strategy formulation and implementation. (ii) The bank does not engage in an on-going activity to evaluate processes, procedures and technology making it difficult to streamline and automate processes resulting in a lot of manual processing. (iii) The bank lacks the internal capabilities required to introduce automated processes which will reduce manual interventions; (iv) Existence of Silos in the business prevent the business from taking advantage of benefits brought about by economies of scale, cross skilling, knowledge sharing, straight through processing and ultimately economies of scope benefit...|$|R

40|$|Facing {{the current}} growing global {{archipelago}} of encampments – including concentration, detention, transit, identification, refugee, military and training camps, {{this article is}} a geographical reflection on ‘the camp’, as a modern institution and as a spatial bio-political technology. In particular, {{it is about the}} past and present camp geographies and the apparatus of dispositifs that make them an ever-present spatial formation in the <b>management</b> of <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> care characterizing many authoritarian regimes as well as many contemporary democracies. I especially focus on the works of Paul Gilroy, Giorgio Agamben and Reviel Netz to discuss camp spatialities, the normalization of camp geographies, and related biopolitics. In doing so, I advance the argument to resist on present-day proliferating manifestations of camp and ‘camp thinking’, calling for the incorporation of ‘camp studies’ into the broader field of political geography to considering the geographies of the camp as constitutive hubs of much broader, modern geo-political economies. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of the Unified Family Court, with procedures emphasizing judicial case <b>management</b> <b>and</b> settlement in <b>custody</b> disputes, provided an opportunity to combine these practices with those of a university hospital-based family court clinic experienced {{in the provision of}} custody assessments. Specifically, a process integrating the clinical custody assessment with the work of counsel and court procedures was developed. This format, incorporating the preparation of a clinical settlement conference brief, was then evaluated with emphasis on time management, outcome in relation to settlement or trial, and the effect of clinical assessment at critical points in the combined endeavour. Method: Seventy-two judicial referrals conducted using this format were reviewed. To assess efficiency, we determined time intervals to various points in the process and compared them to previous local practice. Settlement rates, recorded incrementally to mark each component’s contribution, were compared with rates noted in the literature. Assessment functions were identified according to the point of resolution of the dispute and in a manner to facilitate comparison with previously published work. Results: The format resulted in 50 % of cases settling without trial in under 5 months, a minimum settlement rate of 50 %, and confirmed the ability of clinical assessment to contribute flexibly to dispute resolution in several conciliation venues and at trial...|$|R
