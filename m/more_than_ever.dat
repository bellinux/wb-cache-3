5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense {{of their right to}} reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not {{to speak of}} elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{the royal}} touch {{promoted}} {{the power of the}} monarchy, but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century. During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> and the interest in the disease steadily increased. The Catholic League started a propaganda claiming that Henry III (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession of the Protestant Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> {{in the care of}} Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E

5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the Democrats would have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yet all {{the while}} Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought {{interdependence}} in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own hydrogen bomb programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British hydrogen bomb programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E

Many new wrestlers began fresh without notions of athletic sportsmanship that was popular in competitive arenas, however; they began with dreams of becoming televised superstars.
