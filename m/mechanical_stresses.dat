5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses,</b> especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E

Data from numerous other systems suggest a positive role of tissue mobilization to facilitate optimal wound healing and biomechanically superior tissue. The current {{study sought to}} investigate the potential role of mechanical signaling to attenuate the inflammatory and alter the synthetic properties of fibroblasts cultured from the vocal folds.

Signal transduction pathways in SMCs activated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> that instigate cell migration are undefined. Herein, we provide evidence that <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> enhances SMC migration, which is mediated, at least in part, by protein kinase C (PKC) δ. When rat SMCs cultivated on a flexible membrane were subjected to cyclic strain stress (60 cycles/min, 5, 15, or 20 % elongation), PKCδ was translocated to the Triton-insoluble fraction, whereas PKCα was translocated to the membrane, which was confirmed by PKC kinase assays. Immunofluorescence and actin staining revealed a cytoskeleton translocation of PKCδ in SMCs stimulated by cyclic strain. PKCδ-deficient SMCs cultivated from PKCδ−/ − mice showed an abnormal cytoskeleton structure, which was related to a diminished phosphorylation of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, and vinculin in response to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> enhanced SMC migration, which was diminished in PKCδ−/ − SMCs.

25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses,</b> for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E
25|$|Maculae flavae {{are located}} at the {{anterior}} and posterior ends of the membranous parts of the VF. The histological structure of the macula flava is unique, and Sato and Hirano speculated that it could {{play an important role}} in growth, development and aging of VF. The macula flava is composed of fibroblasts, ground substances, elastic and collagenous fibers. Fibroblasts were numerous and spindle or stellate-shaped. The fibroblasts have been observed to be in active phase, with some newly released amorphous materials present at their surface. From a biomechanical point of view, the role of the macula flava is very important. Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the macula flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the VF. Fibroblasts have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> during phonation were stimulating the fibroblasts to synthesize those fibers.|$|E
25|$|Women {{who have}} {{undergone}} breast augmentation also {{are susceptible to}} breast ptosis; which incidence might be induced by the physical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> exerted by the breast implants upon the internal tissues and the skin envelope; such overstretching thins the skin and atrophies its elastic qualities. Statistically, breast augmentation and mastopexy are plastic surgery operations with low incidence rates of medical complications; yet, when performed as a combined breast-repair procedure (mastopexy–augmentation), the physiologic stresses upon {{the health of the}} woman increase the risks of incision-wound infection, breast-implant exposure, damage to the breast and nipple nerves leading to sensation changes, malposition of the nipple-areola complex, and malposition of the breast implant in the implant pocket. Therefore, a mastopexy–augmentation procedure features increased surgical complication rates, when compared to the lesser complication rates of breast augmentation and mastopexy as discrete surgical operations; likewise, the individual incidence rates of surgical revision and complications, when compared to the revision and complication rates for the combined mastopexy–augmentation procedure. Recent studies of a newer technique for simultaneous augmentation mastopexy (SAM) indicate that it is a safe surgical procedure with minimal medical complications. The SAM technique involves invaginating and tacking the tissues first, in order to previsualize the final result, before making any surgical incisions to the breast.|$|E

A newly developed mathematical hypothesis suggested that mechanical loading, when coupled with a chemotherapeutic drug such as CisPt and immune cells, would boost tumor cell death. The current study investigated the aforementioned mathematical hypothesis by exposing human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG 2) cells to CisPt, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> individually and in combination. HepG 2 cells were also treated with a mixture of CisPt and carnosine with and without <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> to examine one possible mechanism employed by <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> to enhance CisPt effects.

The corrosive condition was fixed at 313  K in 0.5  kmol/m 3 NaCl solution, and the three regions were observed with increasing applied stress: No failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) and failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) with 2 Mo where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and corrosiveness were too low to lead failure, region 2 where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> became adequate to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, and region 1 where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> is too high to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, with a consequent mechanical failure. This is defined as stress-dominated region. Moreover, the corrosiveness was changed from high to low by decreasing pH. Corrosion-dominated region is A, where corrosive degradation is too rapid in induced EIC at the applied <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress,</b> leading to final mechanical failure of the specimen, and final cross section is too small to avoid the mechanical failure whereas no corrosion-dominated region occurs in Cl− ion concentration dependence. Regions II and B are the EIC region where both corrosiveness and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> act synergistically to induce EIC. In regions I and C, both <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and corrosiveness are too low to lead failure, while the chloride concentration of intermetallic compounds are below their critical chloride concentration in region I although material degradation proceeds by prolonged corrosion.

Methods: We used phosphoproteomic techniques to detect phosphorylation changes in chondrocytes under periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and combined the results with the quantitative proteomic data to further explore the underlying mechanisms. Data were obtained by phosphorylation inhibition, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Results: From phosphoproteomic analysis, a total of 1073 phosphorylated proteins and 2054 phosphopeptides were identified. The number of significant differentially expressed proteins and phosphopeptides was 97 and 108, respectively (ratio &#x 3 e; 1. 20 or &#x 3 c; 0. 83 at p&#x 3 c; 0. 05). Periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> increased glycogen synthase kinase 3 -beta (GSK 3 -beta) phosphorylation at Y 216, promoted the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, decreased beta-catenin levels and suppressed the expression of type I collagen. In contrast, inhibition of GSK 3 -beta by TWS 119, which specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of Y 216, suppressed the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, which resulted in the accumulation of beta-catenin and an increase in the expression of type I collagen.
