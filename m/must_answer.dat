5|$|LeapFrog Enterprises {{released}} a Sonic X educational math game for its Leapster handheld game console; {{it was released}} in 2005 in North America and 2007 in Europe. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> math questions to continue. The game features three levels, {{each with its own}} math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.|$|E

5000|$|In law, a {{question}} of fact, {{also known as a}} point of fact, is {{a question}} that <b>must</b> be <b>answered</b> by reference to facts and evidence as well as inferences arising from those facts.

The answer to a question of fact (a [...] "finding of fact") usually depends on particular circumstances or factual situations.|$|R
25|$|The group {{travels to}} the Bridge of Death, where each knight <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> three {{questions}} from the bridge-keeper before proceeding. Lancelot easily answers his questions and crosses the bridge. Robin is confounded by a difficult question, while Galahad gives a wrong answer to an easy one; both are hurled into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Arthur responds to the bridge-keeper's question with a question, and the bridge-keeper is thrown into the chasm for not knowing the answer.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{a counter}} {{is placed in}} the 24-hour-opened main {{entrance}} and a pistol-armed police officer would sit there as the station duty officer, or watch commander, on a 2-or-4-hour watch. The watch commander is the main funnel between that station and civilians within its area of responsibility. He or she {{is in charge of the}} safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> all personal or telephone complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.|$|E

25|$|The website {{no longer}} lists new caches without a {{physical}} container, including virtual and webcam caches; however, older caches {{of these types}} have been grandfathered in (except for locationless/reverse, which are completely archived). Earthcaches {{are one of the}} two exceptions to the no-container rule; they are caches in which players <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> geological questions to complete the cache. The other exception is for event caches; for an event to qualify, it must be specifically or mainly for geocachers, and must have a minimum duration dependent upon its category (CITO, regular, Mega, or Giga). Attendees of event caches can log that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Groundspeak created a waymarking website to handle all other non-physical caches.|$|E
25|$|Ottokar again contested the Imperial Throne in 1273, being almost {{alone in}} this {{position}} in the electoral college. This time he {{refused to accept the}} authority of the successful candidate, Rudolf of Habsburg (Emperor 1273–1291). In November 1274 the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg ruled that all crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II (1250) must be restored, and that King Ottokar II <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> to the Diet for not recognising the new emperor, Rudolf. Ottokar refused either to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{law also}} allows for organ {{donation}} from deceased individuals. In 2013 organs were taken from 36 deceased individuals. Everyone who applies for a driver's licence in New Zealand indicates {{whether or not they}} wish to be a donor if they die in circumstances that would allow for donation. The question is required to be answered for the application to be processed, meaning that the individual <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> yes or no, and does not have the option of leaving it unanswered. However, the answer given on the drivers license does not constitute informed consent, because at the time of drivers license application not all individuals are equipped to make an informed decision regarding whether to be a donor, and it is therefore not the deciding factor in whether donation is carried out or not. It is there to simply give indication of the person's wishes. Family must agree to the procedure for donation to take place.|$|E

25|$|From 1974 until 1999, {{the exam}} had 30 {{questions}} and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally {{during this time}} period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened {{as part of the}} 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.|$|E
25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> these questions and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E
500|$|The {{contestant}} has {{the option}} of starting five {{steps away from the}} bank, meaning that they <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> five questions correctly without being caught to bank the money and continue to the next round. Before the chase starts, the chaser will make two offers to the contestant: one offer will be to play for a lower amount, but start one step closer to the bank, meaning that they will have to answer one less question correctly; the other offer will be to play for a higher amount, but start one step further away from the bank. On rare occasions, if the contestant chooses the higher offer, the chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a [...] "super offer" [...] for an even higher amount— the contestant <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> seven questions correctly without being caught. The chaser starts eight spaces away from the bank.|$|E

500|$|Some studies use a [...] "probe verification" [...] task {{rather than}} an overt {{acceptability}} judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence {{is followed by a}} [...] "probe word", and subjects <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence. [...] This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.|$|E
500|$|The Line is an American {{game show}} pilot co-hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. Created by ITV Studios and {{produced}} by High Noon Entertainment, the pilot showcased contestants waiting in a [...] "line" [...] {{to enter a}} [...] "vault". While in the latter, they <b>must</b> <b>answer</b> a series of eight questions to win a jackpot that grows progressively as contestants fail to answer all eight correctly. While waiting in the line, they may be chosen to perform various challenges. These can earn them additional prizes and/or a move to the front or back of the line. Critical reception for the show was mixed; one writer argued that the show's pace of gameplay was too slow, but was also pleased to see an autistic contestant compete.|$|E

[...] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that [...] "the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time {{on this side of the}} Atlantic." [...] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote [...] "When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he <b>must</b> <b>answer,</b> None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded." ...|$|E
