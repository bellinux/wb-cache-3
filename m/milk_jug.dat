2500|$|Pacelli's biggest rival is Brookstone High School, {{located in}} North Columbus ( [...] north of Pacelli's Midtown campus). Although Pacelli plays Brookstone {{in all of}} their sports, the most popular rivalry is their yearly {{football}} game, dubbed the [...] "Battle for the Jug". The winner of this game gets to keep the [...] "Broocelli Jug" [...] (a <b>milk</b> <b>jug</b> painted red and blue) at their campus for the next year, along with bragging rights. In 2013, Pacelli received the jug {{for the first time}} since 2004 in a 14–7 win. The rivalry first began in 1972, and Brookstone leads the series 27–17–1.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1942, P-47Cs {{were sent}} to England for combat operations. The initial Thunderbolt flyers, 56th Fighter Group, was sent {{overseas}} to join the 8th Air Force. As the P-47 Thunderbolt worked up to operational status, it gained a nickname: the [...] "Jug" [...] (because its profile {{was similar to that}} of a common <b>milk</b> <b>jug</b> of the time). Two Fighter Groups already stationing in England began introducing the Jugs in January 1943: the Spitfire-flying 4th Fighter Group, a unit built around a core of experienced American pilots who had flown in the RAF Eagle Squadrons prior to the US entry in the war; and the 78th Fighter Group, formerly flying P-38 Lightnings.|$|E

After picking a dog, one team member guided their dog pulling a cart carrying two empty <b>milk</b> <b>jugs,</b> {{to one of two}} gondola stations. After unloading the <b>milk</b> <b>jugs</b> and riding the gondola to the top station, teams carried the <b>milk</b> <b>jugs</b> to the dairy farm for that tramway and traded the empties for full jugs. The team member then carried the full jugs back to the gondola and down to their dog, before bringing the dog and full <b>milk</b> <b>jugs</b> to the <b>milk</b> truck for their next clue.|$|R

Demi forgot philosophy, and stuffed like any carnal boy, while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets, and the dolls looked on smiling affably.|$|E
6000|$|Pshaw, I {{missed the}} others, but never mind; flick, flick, it's beginning--What's this? A bedroom, eh? Looks like a girl's bedroom--pretty poor sort of place. I wish the picture would keep still a minute--in Robinson Crusoe it all stayed still and one could sit {{and look at}} it, the blue sea and the green palm trees and the black {{footprints}} in the yellow sand--but this blamed thing keeps rippling and flickering all the time--Ha! there's the girl herself--come into her bedroom. My! I hope she doesn't start to undress in it--that would be fearfully uncomfortable with all these people here. No, she's not undressing--she's gone and opened the cupboard. What's that she's doing--taking out a <b>milk</b> <b>jug</b> and a glass--empty, eh? I guess it must be, because she seemed to hold it upside down. Now she's picked up a sugar bowl--empty, too, eh?--and a cake tin, and that's empty--What on earth does she take them all out for if they're empty? Why can't she speak? I think--hullo--who's this coming in? Pretty hard-looking sort of woman--what's she got in her hand?--some sort of paper, I guess--she looks like a landlady, I shouldn't wonder if-- ...|$|E
60|$|Minister Anderson's {{house is}} in {{the main street of}} Websterbridge, not far from the town hall. To the eye of the eighteenth century New Englander, it is much grander than the plain {{farmhouse}} of the Dudgeons; but it is so plain itself that a modern house agent would let both at about the same rent. The chief dwelling room has the same sort of kitchen fireplace, with boiler, toaster hanging on the bars, movable iron griddle socketed to the hob, hook above for roasting, and broad fender, on which stand a kettle and a plate of buttered toast. The door, between the fireplace and the corner, has neither panels, fingerplates nor handles: it is made of plain boards, and fastens with a latch. The table is a kitchen table, with a treacle colored cover of American cloth, chapped at the corners by draping. The tea service on it consists of two thick cups and saucers of the plainest ware, with <b>milk</b> <b>jug</b> and bowl to match, each large enough to contain nearly a quart, on a black japanned tray, and, {{in the middle of the}} table, a wooden trencher with a big loaf upon it, and a square half pound block of butter in a crock. The big oak press facing the fire from the opposite side of the room, is for use and storage, not for ornament; and the minister's house coat hangs on a peg from its door, showing that he is out; for when he is in it is his best coat that hangs there. His big riding boots stand beside the press, evidently in their usual place, and rather proud of themselves. In fact, the evolution of the minister's kitchen, dining room and drawing room into three separate apartments has not yet taken place; and so, from the point of view of our pampered period, he is no better off than the Dudgeons.|$|E
