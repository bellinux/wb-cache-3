The ground truth {{regarding}} duple or triple metrical grouping is also implicitly {{known from the}} given source {{because it can be}} deduced from the dance style. All Waltzes have triple meter, all other dances have duple meter. Tempo ground truths are not <b>manually</b> double <b>checked</b> as performed in [10], therefore errors among the ground truths might be present. Results with <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> ground truths might improve slightly. This is further discussed near the end of Section 4.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{problem is}} the vulnerability of some current mine flail vehicles to anti-tank mines. This means that, if the presence of anti-tank mines is suspected, the mine-field must, paradoxically, be <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> first to make it safe for the mine flail. These problems have led many humanitarian demining organisations to abandon the use of flails.|$|R
30|$|The {{coverage}} of MSAS was not perfect {{as we did}} not match about 27 % of the papers. For 100 of these unmatched papers we have <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> the titles. We have found that 80 % of the titles contained special characters, such as round/squared parenthesis, Greek letters and/or the symbols _ and ^. When <b>manually</b> <b>checking</b> 100 matched titles, only 5 % of the them contained such special characters. Therefore articles containing the above mentioned special characters were often not matched. This problem affected principally paper {{of belonging to the}} field of superconductivity (PACS 42). From this PACS only 47 % of the articles were matched. We also find a negative correlation of − 0.46 between the fraction of articles matched with the year in which they were printed. This means that older paper in our time period were matched more easily compared to newer ones.|$|R

GitHub is also capable of remotely notifying a MantisBT installation of changes {{to a source}} code repository. Another technique used for integrating MantisBT with web-based source code hosting providers is the use of a job scheduler such as cron to <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> for changes to a repository every few minutes, reporting any changes back to MantisBT.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{test of the}} {{performance}} of two probabilistic classifiers (random forests and multinomial logit models) in automatically defining cancer cases has been carried out on 5608 subjects, registered by the Venetian Tumour Registry (RTV) during the years 1987 – 1996 and <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> for possible second cancers that occurred during the 1997 – 1999 period. An eightfold cross-validation was performed to estimate the classification error; 63 predictive variables were entered into the model fitting. The random forest allows to automatically classify 45 % of subjects with a classification error lower than 5 %, while the corresponding error is 31 % for the multilogit model. The performance of the former classifier is appealing, indicating a potential drop of <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> cases from 1750 to 960 per incidence year with a moderate error rate. This result suggests to refine the approach and extend it to other categories of manually treated cases...|$|R

30|$|Before {{the main}} analysis, the output from the {{automatic}} syllable detection step (as {{described in the}} previous section) is <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> for detection errors. In four of the strophes, initial notes were falsely declared as syllables and were therefore removed manually (in total 4 × 3 syllables). In one strophe a burst of noise was erroneously detected as a syllable and removed as well.|$|R
50|$|Change {{detection}} and notification (CDN) refers to automatic detection of changes made to World Wide Web pages and notification to interested users by email or other means. Whereas search engines {{are designed to}} find web pages, CDN systems are designed to monitor changes to web pages. Before change {{detection and}} notification, {{it was necessary for}} users to <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> for web page changes, either by revisiting web sites or periodically searching again. Efficient and effective change detection and notification is hampered by the fact that most servers do not accurately track content changes through Last-Modified or ETag headers.|$|E
5000|$|Drummer Artimus Pyle told Howard Stern {{years later}} in an {{interview}} that the fuel gauge in the older-model plane was known to malfunction and the pilots had neglected to <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> the tanks before taking off. In his book Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering the Free Birds of Southern Rock, Gene Odom comes to the conclusion that copilot Gray was potentially impaired and had been observed using cocaine the previous evening; however, toxicology reports from both pilots' autopsies found no traces of alcohol or other drugs. [...] "Crew inattention to fuel supply" [...] was ultimately determined to be responsible for the crash.|$|E
50|$|The Registry {{contains}} important configuration {{information for}} the operating system, for installed applications {{as well as individual}} settings for each user and application. A careless change to the operating system configuration in the Registry could cause irreversible damage, so it is usually only installer programs which perform changes to the Registry database during installation/configuration and removal. If a user wants to edit the Registry manually, Microsoft recommends that a backup of the Registry is performed before the change. When a program is removed from control panel, it is not completely removed and the user must <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> inside directories such as program files. After this, the user needs to manually remove any reference to the uninstalled program in the registry. This is usually done by using regedit.exe. Editing the Registry is sometimes necessary when working around Windows-specific issues e.g. problems when logging onto a domain can be resolved by editing the Registry.|$|E

50|$|Red Orchestra 2 is a {{realistic}} first-person shooter. Guns behave realistically, with bullet drop and spin taken into account. The game also takes away {{many of the}} elements of a traditional HUD, like an ammo counter, forcing players to remember, or <b>manually</b> <b>check,</b> the approximate number of rounds that are left in the gun's magazine. When reloading a weapon, the character checks the weight of the new magazine and determines if it is heavy (full or close to full) or light (empty or close to empty). The game's first-person cover system allows players to hide behind all objects in the world to avoid gunfire. While in cover, players can peek out to take more accurate shots or fire blindly. However, the shape, size and, composition of the object changes its effectiveness at protecting the player. Smaller objects may not cover the player's entire body, and some may not stop bullets. Health does not regenerate over time or by use of medical equipment, but non-fatal wounds must still be bandaged so no more health is lost through blood loss.|$|E

A forth month inspection and Symposiums is conducted with the Barangay Health Worker to discuss {{the importance of this}} program, to <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> the cleanliness of the house and its surroundings, if the garbage are well-segregated at the garbage bins provided and the backyard gardening as well. An Annual inspection with the health sanitary officers and the local government is also done to check which household/ area failed to do the same program, will be given assistance from the local government, thus Lucod has received various of recognitions from both local and provincial government, and has been the role model to other barangays to promote the same program. Through this, Lucod has marked for being one of the cleanest Barangay.|$|E
5000|$|ARQ {{was first}} used commercially in 1947 with a link from Amsterdam to New York with the master station in Amsterdam. In May 1950 the TEX (Overseas {{teleprinter}} exchange) service between New York and Amsterdam started. TEX was an early name for TELEX which is a system to allow automatic routing of private messages from a sender to a receiver on the TELEX network. Prior to the introduction or ARQ-M {{there were so many}} errors in the messages received that staff from the telecommunications companies had to <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> messages and conform correct receipt. Once ARQ-M was introduced, messages could be automatically and reliably sent over long distances via shortwave radio, and so was introduced into automatic systems. By 1956 ARQ radio circuits were running from New York to Amsterdam, Berne, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Paramaribo, Paris, Rome, and Wien, with plans for Copenhagen, Lisbon, Madrid, and Oslo. Amsterdam had radio links to Berne, Curaçao, Jakarta, Paramaribo and Rome. Brussels linked to Leopoldville. Frankfurt was connected to Madrid and Rome with plans for Buenos Aires. A link from Madrid to Canary Islands was planned. [...] By 1959 most radio circuits for Telex were using ARQ. International shortwave ARQ data links have been replaced by undersea cables and satellite circuits.|$|E
30|$|Spectral peak {{wavelengths}} were objectively determined {{using the}} peak analyzer function of OriginPro 8.6 Data Analysis and Graphing Software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA). Savitzky-Golay smoothing with a window size of 50 was first performed on spectral data followed with peak finding using a local maximum method with two local points. Calculated peak wavelengths were then <b>manually</b> <b>checked</b> against the plotted spectra to confirm accuracy. When spectra contained multiple peaks, the peak with higher intensity was analyzed.|$|R

30|$|The {{solution}} to touch-on errors has been independent calibration, both {{immediately prior to}} acquiring influence function data, and immediately before polishing. The procedure is to perform touch-on, then back-off the tool through a known distance under software control, and <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> the distance by inserting and withdrawing a shim of known thickness. Any discrepancies can then be compensated in software through modifying the Z-offset.|$|E
30|$|First, we can <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> {{the results}} to find most {{suitable}} pairs {{to put in the}} dictionary. This approach can significantly reduce the number of User-Agents assigned to a single cipher suite list which differ only in software version or other detail. It can also improve the quality of client type grouping. For example, User-Agents of mobile devices often include type of hardware. However, this is laborious and error-prone.|$|E
30|$|Polarity {{shifting}} is {{a phenomenon}} in sentiment analysis that denotes the inversion, attenuation, or cancelation of the sentiment of a polarity clue (i.e., word or phrase) in a sentence. A polarity shifting pattern is a pattern that performs polarity shifting. Previous {{research has shown that}} the detection of polarity shifting can improve the performance of sentiment analysis. Currently, researchers often <b>manually</b> <b>check</b> a corpus line by line to find sentences containing polarity shifting and then extract the polarity shifting pattern. However, this process is time-consuming and may miss many polarity shifting patterns.|$|E

40|$|In Myanmar language, {{sentences}} {{are clearly}} delimited by a unique sentence boundary marker but are written without necessarily pausing between words with spaces. It is therefore non-trivial to segment sentences into words. Word tokenizing plays {{a vital role}} in most Natural Language Processing applications. We observe that word boundaries generally align with syllable boundaries. Working directly with characters does not help. It is therefore useful to syllabify texts first. Syllabification is also a non-trivial task in Myanmar. We have collected 4550 syllables from available sources. We have evaluated our syllable inventory on 2, 728 sentences spread over 258 pages and observed a coverage of 99. 96 %. In the second part, we build word lists from available sources such as dictionaries, through the application of morphological rules, and by generating syllable n-grams as possible words and <b>manually</b> <b>checking.</b> We have thus built list of 800, 000 words including inflected forms.
