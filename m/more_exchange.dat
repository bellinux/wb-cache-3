For example, {{it has been shown that}} horizontal transfer between closely related species results in <b>more</b> <b>exchange</b> of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called gene conversion, mediated by homologous recombination.

Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E

In most areas this did not require any changes to the telephone codes or numbers, e.g. the Sevenoaks STD code changed from 0SE2 to its numerical equivalent 0732. However, in Director telephone {{areas such as the}} London telephone area, the changes permitted many new exchange codes to be issued that did not correspond to letters representing the geographic locations. As '1' was also available for the 'B' and 'C' digits, this allowed many <b>more</b> <b>exchange</b> codes such as 211, 219, 221 to be used. At the same time, many local exchange codes were altered in order to group them into geographic sectors (e.g. GROsvenor became 499 rather than 470) to eliminate the need for all incoming calls to be routed via central London.|$|E

5000|$|In Das Kapital, Karl Marx {{identified}} the commodity {{as the basic}} unit of capitalist organization. Marx described a [...] "common denominator" [...] between commodities, in particular that commodities {{are the product of}} labor and are related to each other by an exchange value (i.e., price). By using the labor theory of value, Marxists see a connection between labor and exchange value, in that commodities are exchanged depending on the socially necessary labor time needed to produce them. However, due to the productive forces of industrial organization, laborers are seen as creating <b>more</b> <b>exchange</b> value {{during the course of the}} working day than the cost of their survival (food, shelter, clothing, etc.). Marxists argue that capitalists are thus able to pay for this cost of survival, while expropriating the excess labor (i.e., surplus value).|$|E
5000|$|Venezuela {{is a major}} {{producer}} of oil products, which remains the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. Under the Chávez government, crude oil production decreased from 3.12 {{million barrels a day}} when Chávez took office in 1999, to 2.95 million barrels a day in 2007, whilst oil prices increased 660%. The state income from oil revenue [...] "increased from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006"; oil exports [...] "have grown from 77% in 1997 ... to 89% in 2006"; and some economists view [...] "this dependence on oil is one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government". [...] Indeed, Stephen Randall, Director of the University of Calgary's Latin American Research Centre, points out that during his years in power Venezuela increased it dependency on oil exports to 95% (2012) from 80% when he took power in 1999. [...] Furthermore, before the financial crisis in 2008 Venezuelan oil was selling at $129/bbl. It then dropped to $43/bbl by March 2009. Instead of reining in spending Chavez responded to reduced revenues by introducing <b>more</b> <b>exchange</b> controls and continuing with nationalizations. A 2014 article by CNBC stated that under Chávez, oil production declined from 3.5 million barrels per day to 2.6 million barrels per day, though Venezuela only made a profit from 1.4 million barrels per day due to Venezuela giving large amounts of its oil away for free. CNBC continued stating that though oil production decreased, public spending increased to over 50% of the GDP, spending more than received in oil profits which led to foreign loans that amounted to over $106 billion as of 2012. Foreign investment flows {{by the end of his}} presidency in 2013 were half what they had been in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|The law {{of value}} {{originates}} in the [...] "terms of exchange" [...] established for different products. If a producer has to supply {{too much of}} his own product to get a different product, this has direct consequences for the additional time he has to work to sustain himself and the trading of his product. Over time, and with more market integration, relatively stable values for products are established in accordance with production norms which exist independently of the productivity of individual producers. In that situation, each producer has to adapt his own production to those socially accepted values, the average terms of trade for products vary only within fairly narrow margins, and thus producers' activities fall under the sway {{of the law of}} value, which links [...] "the economy of labour-time" [...] with [...] "the economy of trade". Paradoxically, as Marx says, the more that the producers become dependent on exchange, the <b>more</b> <b>exchange</b> appears to become independent of them. [...] Product-markets begin to operate according to their own laws, to which the producers can only adjust themselves. If some prices go up, many other prices will go up as well, because people have to cover their increased costs. If some prices go down, many other prices will go down as well, since products otherwise fail to sell, when cheaper alternatives become available. But no individual is in control of these price fluctuations, or in control of how all the price changes will impact on each other. All they can really do to influence the market, is to raise or lower their own prices, but even so they can do that only within certain limits. So, ordinarily, people have to accept and work with many given cost-price levels and given sale-price levels which they cannot do anything about. If a product cannot be produced at a certain cost, or if it cannot be sold at a certain price-level, it is unlikely that it will be available much at all.|$|E
