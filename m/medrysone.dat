50|$|<b>Medrysone</b> (INN, USAN) (brand names HMS, Medrocort, others; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} NSC-63278), {{also known as}} hydroxymethylprogesterone, methylhydroxyprogesterone, or hydroxymesterone, as well as 6α-methyl-11β-hydroxyprogesterone or 6α-methyl-11β-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is or {{has been used in}} the treatment of inflammatory eye diseases. It has been discontinued in the United States. Although it is very similar in structure to progesterone, neither progestogenic nor androgenic activity has been demonstrated for or attributed to <b>medrysone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Local therapy- Topical steroids are effective. Commonly used {{solutions}} are of fluorometholone, <b>medrysone,</b> betamethasone or dexamethasone. Mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglycate (2%) drops 4-5 {{times a day}} are quite effective in controlling VKC, especially atopic ones. Azelastine eyedrops are also effective. Topical antihistamines can be used. Acetyl cysteine (0.5%) used topically has mucolytic properties and is useful {{in the treatment of}} early plaque formation. Topical Cyclosporine is reserved for unresponsive cases.|$|E
40|$|Long term use of topical &#x 0026;amp; {{systemic}} steroids produce secondary {{open angle}} glaucoma similar to chronic simple glaucoma. The increased IOP caused by prolonged steroid therapy is reversible {{but the damage}} produced by it is irreversible. In this study, we analysed 25 patients (44 eyes) with steroid induced glaucoma, who reported to us with dimness of vision, haloes and elevated I. O. P. and were using steroids for long duration due to various causes. The behaviour of the I. O. P. due to different steroid preparations, the type of lenticular change, and the management of those cases are discussed in this paper. From our study we conclude that dexamethasone and betamethasone both topical as well as systemic are more potent in producing glaucoma and cataract than <b>medrysone</b> and prednisolone. The condition is reversible without permanent damage when the duration of steroid therapy is short and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Steroid-induced {{glaucoma}} {{is a form}} of {{open-angle glaucoma}} occurring as an adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy. 1 It is usually associated with topical steroid use, but it may develop with oral, intravenous, inhaled, or periocular steroid adminis-tration by causing decrease in aqueous outflow facility. A number of drugs have been implicated in corticosteroid-induced glaucoma including dexamethasone, betamethasone, predni-solone, <b>medrysone,</b> fluoromethalone, hydrocortisone, cortisone, etc. Glucocorticoids may exert their effect by increased expression of the MYOC (TIGR) gene at Locus GLC 1 A. 2 INCIDENCE Steroid-responsive intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations can occur in people of all ages, although children are less frequently reported to have IOP elevation with steroids. 3 No gender and racial predilection exists for steroid-responsive glaucoma. Incidence of steroid-induced IOP elevation in patients on systemic corticosteroids is unknown because most of these patients do not have their IOP checked. These patients may be discovered during a routine eye exam while on medication, or the glaucoma may have progressed to the point of causing visual symptoms. Patients taking topical steroid drops usually receive follow-up care by an ophthal-mologist who monitors IOP. Approximately one-third of individuals experience moderate increase in IOP after topical steroid use. However, 5 - 6 % of normal population develops a marked increase of IOP after 4 - 6 weeks of topical steroid therapy. 4 - 7 Thus, 5 % of the general population is considered to be “steroid responder”, i. e. may develop steroid-induced glaucoma when steroids are administered. This is shown by studies conducted by Armaly and Becker (Table 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{transformation}} of the anti-inflammatory steroid <b>medrysone</b> (1) was carried {{out for the first}} time with the filamentous fungi Cunninghamella blakesleeana (ATCC 8688 a), Neurospora crassa (ATCC 18419), and Rhizopus stolonifer (TSY 0471). The objective was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the substrate (1) and its metabolites. This yielded seven new metabolites, 14 α-hydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11, 20 -trione (2), 6 β-hydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11, 20 -trione (3), 15 β-hydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11, 20 -trione (4), 6 β, 17 α-dihydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11, 20 -trione (5), 6 β, 20 S-dihydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11 -dione (6), 11 β, 16 β-dihydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11 -dione (7), and 15 β, 20 R-dihydroxy- 6 α-methylpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 11 -dione (8). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique unambiguously established the structures of the metabolites 2, 4, 6, and 8. Fungal {{transformation of}} 1 yielded oxidation at the C- 6 β, - 11 β, - 14 α, - 15 β, - 16 β positions. Various cellular anti-inflammatory assays, including inhibition of phagocyte oxidative burst, T-cell proliferation, and cytokine were performed. Among all the tested compounds, metabolite 6 (IC 50 = 30. 3 μg/mL) moderately inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from zymosan-induced human whole blood cells. Compounds 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 strongly inhibited the proliferation of T-cells with IC 50 values between < 0. 2 - 10. 4 μg/mL. Compound 7 was found to be the most potent inhibitor (IC 50 < 0. 2 μg/mL), whereas compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed moderate levels of inhibition (IC 50 = 14. 6 - 20. 0 μg/mL). Compounds 1, and 7 also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. All these compounds were found to be non-toxic to 3 T 3 cells (mouse fibroblast), and also showed no activity when tested against HeLa (human epithelial carcinoma), or against PC 3 (prostate cancer) cancer cell lines...|$|E
