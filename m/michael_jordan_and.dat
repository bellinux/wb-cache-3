5|$|The Fab Five, the 1991 {{recruiting}} {{class of}} five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having {{gone to the}} championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by <b>Michael</b> <b>Jordan,</b> <b>and</b> for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited.
