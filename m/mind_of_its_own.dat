The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
25|$|The balloon follows Pascal {{through the}} streets of Paris, and they draw {{inquisitive}} looks from adults and the envy of other children as they wander the streets. At one point it enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who becomes angry with him and locks him up in his office until school is over. At another, he and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> too, as evidenced by its act of following his.|$|E
25|$|A boastful donkey {{refuses to}} behave or obey {{the orders of}} its masters. Having a <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> it leaves {{whatever}} master it has and manages to wander through Judea. Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E

Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had a <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E
500|$|Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson) {{approaches}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{and asks}} her to cure {{her of her}} vampirism, as she no longer wants to be immortal. Bubblegum agrees to perform an experimental procedure which extracts the vampiric essence from Marceline's body, but is unsure of whether it has worked or not. As Marceline recovers, the extracted essence gains a <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> and escapes. Meanwhile, Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) are called out to investigate livestock being attacked by a bloodsucking creature. Suspecting Marceline, Finn and Jake confront of her, only to discover the extracted essence has transformed into the vampire attacking the livestock. However, as Finn and Jake chase the vampire, a mob of angry villagers capture Marceline and leave her to be destroyed by the rising sun. As the light engulfs her body, Marceline begins reliving memories of her past. As a child, she's comforted by a lullaby sung by her mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar), entitled [...] "Everything Stays." [...] She witnesses Simon leaving her {{to protect her from}} himself. As a teenager, she hunts vampires and discovers she can absorb their powers. Later she befriends a tribe of Hyoomans, who are constructing a boat to escape the continent and avoid an impending catastrophe they fear will happen. Marceline helps fight off more vampires, and tells the Hyoomans to flee when the Vampire King arrives. Back in the present, everybody is shocked when they see that the sunlight doesn't kill Marceline, meaning that she has been cured of her vampirism. Meanwhile, Jake encounters the vampires Marceline had previously killed, now resurrected from Marceline's freed vampiric essence.|$|E
40|$|Maryland in {{the mid-nineteenth}} century was a state trying to balance its {{regional}} ties to both an agrarian culture based on the institution of slavery and an industrializing, urban culture. Caught in between two warring societies, Marylanders themselves were unsure of their identity given the rapid changes of the late antebellum decades. This study argues Maryland's cultural identity shifted from being a "southern" state in 1861 to being a "northern" state by 1865 in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> citizens {{as well as in the}} <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> politicians, soldiers, and civilians from other parts of the nation. This transition was the result of economic, political, and social changes that took place in the state during the late antebellum period, although cultural and ideological recognition of this shift did not occur until the war brought Maryland's dual identities into focus and compelled state citizens to choose a side in the conflict. A minority of citizens contested the state's "northern" identity both during and after the war, but the new cultural identity remained dominant largely because northern industrial, urban, and demographic patterns were already well-established and Union military policies directed most Marylanders' political and economic behavior towards a loyal and northern-looking orientation by the end of the war. Understanding these cultural dynamics in a border state like Maryland helps to clarify our vision of complicated and competing ideologies in mid-nineteenth century America...|$|R

2500|$|Although Priapus is {{commonly}} associated with the failed attempts of rape against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid’s comedy Fasti and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus' protection traits {{can be traced back}} to the importance placed on the phallus in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection). [...] In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have a <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man.

In the cause as self-conscious Ideal, the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> thinking nature as the ‘measure of all things,’ - as ‘source, motive, path, original, and end,’ - we at length come to causation in the strictest sense, Kant’s Causality with freedom. It might happily be called, in contrast to natural causation, supernatural* causation; or, in contradistinction from physical, metaphysical causation. The causality of self-consciousness - the causality that creates and incessantly re-creates in the light <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> Idea, and by the attraction {{of it as an}} ideal originating in the self consciousness purely - is the only complete causality, because it is the only form of being that is unqualifiedly free.” ...|$|R

60|$|But since God, {{in giving}} us the light of reason, has not thereby tied up his own hands from affording us, when he thinks fit, the light of revelation {{in any of those}} matters wherein our natural faculties are able to give a {{probable}} determination; REVELATION, where God has been pleased to give it, MUST CARRY IT AGAINST THE PROBABLE CONJECTURES OF REASON. Because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does not evidently know, but only yielding to the probability that appears in it, is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which, it is satisfied, comes from one who cannot err, and will not deceive. But yet, it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> being a revelation, and of the signification of the words wherein it is delivered. Indeed, if anything shall be thought revelation which is contrary to the plain principles of reason, and the evident knowledge the <b>mind</b> has <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> clear and distinct ideas; there reason must be hearkened to, as to a matter within its province. Since a man can never have so certain a knowledge, that a proposition which contradicts the clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge was divinely revealed, or that he understands the words rightly wherein it is delivered, as he has that the contrary is true, and so is bound to consider and judge of it as a matter of reason, and not swallow it, without examination, as a matter of faith.|$|R
60|$|Secondly, {{the other}} {{fountain}} from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,--the {{perception of the}} operations <b>of</b> our own <b>mind</b> within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;--which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, {{which could not be}} had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;--which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called INTERNAL SENSE. But as I call the other Sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the <b>mind</b> takes <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations <b>of</b> our own <b>minds</b> within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings. The term OPERATIONS here I use in a large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions <b>of</b> the <b>mind</b> about <b>its</b> ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.|$|R
