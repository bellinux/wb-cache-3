5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> {{her initial}} {{election}} {{was whether the}} two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol was a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but {{was careful to}} speak well of temperance advocates, {{many of whom were}} women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E
5|$|After {{rendering}} noncombat {{service in}} World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, {{becoming the first}} Republican county judge {{in the history of}} Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.|$|E

5|$|Air {{pollution}} is a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> Mumbai. According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m3, which is 6.3 {{times higher than}} that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5. The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{settled the}} issue of Chinese immigration, passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. Arthur {{initially}} vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a later compromise bill, which banned immigration from China for ten years. Tariffs, a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the campaign, remained largely unchanged {{in the four years}} that followed, although Congress did pass a minor revision that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent. After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> both England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> {{the emergence of the}} American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} {{convention}} in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin {{reported to the}} Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was a <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed {{by a vote of}} 1626. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.|$|E
