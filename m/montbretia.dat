5000|$|U-624, U-522, U-521, U-224, U-383, U-454 and U-753 {{launched}} torpedoes in the pre-dawn hours. [...] U-624 sank the 5,344-ton British tanker President Sergent and the 4,732-ton American freighter Parismina {{and damaged}} the 5,432-ton American freighter Yaka which was later sunk by U-522. The Type 271 centimeter-wavelength radar-equipped corvettes counterattacked, and U-184 was sunk {{by one of}} those attacks. <b>Montbretia</b> was torpedoed by U-262 and sank while still moving forward.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{commonly}} {{known in the}} United States as coppertips or falling stars, and in the United Kingdom as <b>montbretia.</b> Other names, for hybrids and cultivars, include antholyza, and curtonus. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Greek words krokos, meaning [...] "saffron", and osme, meaning [...] "odor" [...] - from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from Crocus - another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) - when immersed in hot water.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} of his creations, though, were undoubtedly his lilacs. Starting in 1870 Lemoine and his descendants (Émile Lemoine (1862-1942) and Henri Lemoine (1897-1982)) introduced over 200 new lilac cultivars. In 1876 {{he created the}} double French hybrids and hybridized the first Hyacinthiflora lilacs. However, his work {{was by no means}} confined to lilacs. During the last fifteen years of his life he produced excellent new varieties of Astilbe, cannas, Delphinium, Deutzia, Gladiolus, Heuchera, Hydrangea, Penstemon, peonies, Philadelphus, and Weigela, as well as more modest efforts in chrysanthemums, dahlias, bush honeysuckles, <b>Montbretia,</b> Phlox, saxifrages, and Spiraea.|$|E

Group B-6 had sailed without the destroyers Fame and Viscount which had been damaged {{in the battle for}} eastbound convoy SC 104.

50|$|The Mount Selinda area {{is home to}} a {{staggering}} array of indigenous African flora, fungi, birds, butterflies, insects and reptiles. This is mainly due to its position adjoining the Chirinda Forest Botanical Reserve which is protected by law.Among the hundreds of indigenous trees found in Mount Selinda are Red mahogany, Brown mahogany, Natal mahogany, Albizia, White stinkwood, Chirinda stinkwood, Ironwood and colossal specimens of strangling figs. The largest Red Mahogany tree in southern Africa, a 1,000- to 2,000-year-old leviathan with a trunk diameter of some 6 metres stands at Mount Selinda.Other smaller flora include thousands of specimens of the yucca-like Dracaena fragrans, numerous ferns, creepers, vines, epiphytes, <b>montbretia,</b> orchids and flame lilies.Due to its proximity to the botanical reserve, Mount Selinda boasts a dazzling array of bird life, with Trumpeter hornbills, Livingstone's turaco, African pygmy kingfishers, Firefinches, Sunbirds, African green pigeons, Owls, Nightjars, Eagles and Bee-eaters.The sheer variety and brilliant colours of butterflies in the area is also noteworthy.Samango monkeys are often seen in the area.The reptile population consists of, amongst others, pythons, cobras, vipers, mambas, adders, chameleons, geckos, skinks and lizards. The endemic chameleon Marshall's leaf chameleon, Rhampholeon marshalli, is found within the forest and at the forest margin and it is scattered sparsely in suitable forest habitat throughout the mountains of the Eastern Highlands.|$|E
40|$|Study of {{some early}} types of species now known {{to belong to}} the genus  Tritonia Ker Gaw l [...] a member of Iridaceae. sub­ family Crocoideae, {{comprising}} some 28 species of southern and south tropical Africa, has shown the need for some nomen- clatural adjustments. Ixia undulata Burm. f. (1768) is an earlier name for T. crispa (L. f.) Ker Gawl. based on Gladiolus crispus L. f. (1782) and the combination  T. undulata (Burm. f.) Baker must be used for the species, which is native to the western half of Western Cape, South Africa. The variety  T. crispa var. parx iflora is also reduced to synonymy. The type specimen of Ixia gladiolaris Lam. (1789), currently considered a synonym of Tritonia securigera (Aiton) Ker Gawl [...] has flowers that lack the characteristic tooth-like ridges on the lower tepals of the latter, and corresponds closely to the eastern southern African  T.   lineata (Salisb.) Ker Gawl., based on Gladiolus lineatus Salisb. (1796). The new combination  T. gladiolaris (Lam.) Goldblatt & J. C. Manning is made and  T. lineata is reduced to synonymy.   <b>Montbretia</b> lacerata and  Tritonia lacerata. erroneously regarded as synonyms of T. crispa, are combinations based on Gladiolus laceratus Burm. f., a species that remains unidenti­ fied because no type is known and the description is too vague to permit its identification. Lastly, field {{studies have shown that the}} cnsped-leaved T. watermeveri is connected by a series of morphological intermediates to typical  T. securigera. which has straight leaves and identical flowers. The new combination  T. securigera subsp. watermeveri (L. Bolus) J. C. Manning & Goldblatt is proposed for this taxon...|$|E
