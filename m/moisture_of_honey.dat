Indeed, while the botanical resources available to produce the honeys may be different, the seasonal variability is similar.

The present study aimed to evaluate physicochemical characteristics and quality <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> from different origins. Melissopalynological analysis <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> samples showed a wide variability, with samples from different honey sources being collected from different geographical origins. The colour ranged from light amber for Egyptian and Yemeni samples to amber for Saudi and Kashmiri samples. Egyptian and Yemeni samples recorded the higher acidity than Saudi and Kashmiri honey, but all samples are still within the standard limit (pH 3. 40 ± 0. 002 – 6. 10 ± 0. 003). The electrical conductivity (EC) ranged from 0. 53 ± 0. 03 to 4. 18 ± 0. 05 ms/cm. The <b>moisture</b> content <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> samples was ranged from 14. 73 ± 0. 36 % to 18. 32 ± 0. 67 %. Ash content ranged from 0. 23 ± 0. 02 % to 2. 33 ± 0. 02 %. Kashmiri honey showed the highest protein content (4. 67 ± 0. 171 mg/g) while the lowest value of protein content was registered in Egyptian honey (1. 69 ± 0. 015 mg/g).

Methods: By using standard methods samples were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties including additive effect of starch and non-peroxidase activity, antioxidative properties (phenol contents, flavonoid contents, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity). Prior to this evaluation, complete physico-chemical properties including pH, color, ash contents, protein contents, moisture contents, hydroxymethyl furfural contents, total sugar contents, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar contents were analyzed. Results: Relatively higher ash contents {{were found in}} the Siddar honey i. e. (0. 590 0 ± 0. 033 6) % and small honey showed relatively higher protein contents i. e. (777. 598 ± 9. 880) mg/kg. The <b>moisture</b> contents <b>of</b> tested <b>honey</b> samples ranged between 13. 8 %- 16. 6 %, total sugar contents from 61. 672 %- 72. 420 % and non-reducing sugar contents from 1. 95 %- 3. 93 %. Presences of phenolic contents indicate higher antioxidant potential <b>of</b> these <b>honey</b> samples. All bacteria showed clear inhibition zones in response to tested honey samples whereas fungi and yeast showed inhibition at higher concentrations <b>of</b> these <b>honey</b> samples. For Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Aspergillus niger, overall the small honey showed the higher activity than other honey samples.

40|$|The {{small hive beetle}} (Aethina tumida Murray) is an endemic {{scavenger}} in colonies <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bee (Apis mellifera L.) subspecies inhabiting sub-Saharan Africa. The beetle {{only occasionally}} damages host colonies in its native range and such damage is usually restricted to weakened/diseased colonies or is associated with after absconding events due to behavioral resistance mechanisms of its host. The beetle has recently been introduced into North America and Australia where populations of managed subspecies <b>of</b> European <b>honey</b> bees have proven highly susceptible to beetle depredation. Beetles are able to reproduce in large numbers in European colonies and their larvae weaken colonies by eating honey, pollen, and bee brood. Further, adult and larval defecation is thought to promote the fermentation <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and large populations of beetles can cause European colonies to abscond, both resulting in additional colony damage. The economic losses attributed to the beetle since its introduction into the United States have been estimated in millions of US dollars. Although beetles feed on foodstuffs found within colonies, experiments in vitro show that they can also complete entire life cycles on fruit. Regardless, they reproduce best on diets <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> pollen, and bee brood. After feeding, beetle larvae exit the colony and burrow into the ground where they pupate. Neither soil type nor density affects a beetle’s ability to successfully pupate. Instead, successful pupation appears to be closely tied to soil <b>moisture.</b> African subspecies <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees employ a complicated scheme of confinement (aggressive behavior toward and guarding of beetles) to limit beetle reproduction in a colony. Despite being confined away from food, adult beetles are able to solicit food and feed from the mouths <b>of</b> their <b>honey</b> bee guards. Remarkably, beetle-naïve European honey bees also confine beetles and this behavior is quantitatively {{similar to that in}} African bees. If confinement efforts fail, beetles access the combs where they feed and reproduce. Two modes of beetle oviposition in sealed bee brood have been identified. In the first mode, beetles bite holes in the cappings of cells and oviposit on the pupa contained within. In the second mode, beetles enter empty cells, bite a hole in the wall of the cell, and oviposit on the brood in the adjacent cell. Despite this, African bees detect and remove all of the infected brood (hygienic behavior). Similarly, European bees can detect and remove brood that has been oviposited on by beetles. Enhancing the removal rate of infected brood in European colonies through selective breeding may achieve genetic control of beetles. Additional avenues of control were tested for efficacy against beetles. Reducing colony entrances slowed beetle ingress but the efficacy of this method probably depends on other factors. Further, the mortality of beetle pupae was higher when contacting species of the fungus Aspergillus than when not, making biological control an option. Regardless, no control tested to date proved efficacious at the level needed by beekeepers so an integrated approach to controlling beetles remains preferred. The amalgamation of the data presented in this dissertation contributed to a discussion on the beetle’s ecological niche, ability to impact honey bee colonies in ways never considered, and the ability to predict the beetle’s spread and impact globally...|$|R
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> {{has been known}} since the 19 th century. Recently, the potent activity <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> against antibiotic-resistant bacteria has further increased the interest for application <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> but incomplete knowledge of the {{antibacterial activity}} is a major obstacle for clinical applicability. The high sugar concentration, hydrogen peroxide, and the low pH are well-known antibacterial factors in honey and more recently, methylglyoxal and the antimicrobial peptide bee defensin- 1 were identified as important antibacterial compounds in honey. The antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> is highly complex due to the involvement of multiple compounds and due to the large variation in the concentrations of these compounds among honeys. The current review will elaborate on the antibacterial compounds in honey. We discuss {{the activity of the}} individual compounds, their contribution to the complex antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> a novel approach to identify additional honey antibacterial compounds, and the implications of the novel developments for standardization <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> for medical applications.

40|$|AbstractHoney {{exhibits}} antimicrobial activities {{against a}} wide range of bacteria in different milieu. This study aims to compare the effects of five types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> (both imported and local Saudi honey) against Staphylococcus aureus. The five types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> (Manuka Honey UMF + 20, Manuka Honey UMF + 16, Active + 10 Manuka Honey, Sidr honey and Nigella sativa honey) were evaluated for their bactericidal/bacteriostatic activities against both methicillin resistant and sensitive S. aureus. The inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> on bacterial growth was evident at concentrations of 20 % and 10 % (v/v). Manuka Honey showed the best results. Manuka Honey UMF + 20 had a bactericidal effect on both methicillin resistant and sensitive S. aureus. However, Sidr and N. sativa honey exerted only a bacteriostatic effect. The efficacy of different types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> against S. aureus was dependent on the type <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and the concentration at which it was administered. Manuka Honey had the best bactericidal activity. Future experiments should be conducted to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> on bacterial resistance...|$|R
