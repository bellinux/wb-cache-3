50|$|War Child {{was founded}} in 1993 by British filmmakers Bill Leeson and David Wilson, when they {{returned}} from filming {{in the war in}} former Yugoslavia. In 1993 the first War Child convoy with equipment, and food to run a <b>mobile</b> <b>bakery</b> travelled to former Yugoslavia. War Child Netherlands was founded shortly after in 1994 by Willemijn Verloop, when she met Music Therapy professor Nigel Osborne during the war in Bosnia; War Child Holland programmes have been concerned with provision of psychosocial aid. War Child Canada {{was founded in}} 1998 by Samantha Nutt and Eric Hoskins.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Rudolph {{launched}} a new project called [...] "Bus Stop Bakery", a [...] "student company" [...] with the non-profit organization Jong Ondernemen (Young Entrepreneurs). It is a collaboration between eight students from Fontys Academy for Creative Industries and guest lecturer Rudolph van Veen. For this project an old school bus was converted into a <b>mobile</b> <b>bakery</b> and tours the Netherlands selling creative cupcakes. The income is donated to several charitable purposes. After completion of the project, Bus Stop Bakery was awarded the [...] "Best Student Company of the Netherlands 2011" [...] award.|$|E
50|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} {{the site was}} used by various {{governmental}} departments, its major function being a buffer storage depot to supply emergency rations and foodstuffs, and associated facilities such as <b>mobile</b> <b>bakeries</b> and canteens. In 1994 the site was closed, and a programme of demolition was undertaken. This involved the dropping of buildings onto their footprints, and the rubble being mounded over with topsoil. Several major structures, and many ancillary buildings, still survive across the site.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{off with}} <b>mobile</b> <b>bakeries</b> from the UK and with both {{rebuilding}} and music programmes from Holland, War Child projects expanded rapidly during the years. War Child expanded programmes within the Balkan {{to other countries}} and regions, like Kosovo. In 1995 War Child UK was undertaking {{the establishment of a}} very special Children's Music Centre in Mostar, later to be called The Pavarotti Music Centre. War Child Holland actively supporting the Music Therapy Programme in Bosnia, a direction they would later specialise in; using creative and psychosocial means to heal trauma's of war. From 1995 the War Child Diabetic Programme restored the diabetic support system in Bosnia; and until 1998 War Child remained one of the main suppliers of diabetic medicines throughout Bosnia Hercegovina.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{contemporary}} Scottish diet is unhealthy and a {{risk factor}} for poor health outcomes including obesity. Over a third of Scottish children are at risk of being overweight or obese, and there have been calls to strengthen the evidence base {{on the role of the}} food retail environment around schools in influencing the consumption of unhealthy foods. Methods: We examined the food retail environment around five secondary schools in Glasgow city, Scotland. Trained fieldworkers observed the food purchasing behaviour of school pupils in local shops. Samples of the most popular foods were subsequently purchased by the research team and assessed for nutritional content, including energy, total and saturated fat, and salt. This was compared with the nutrient standards for school lunches established by the Scottish Government. Results: There was marked variation in the number of outlets identified within a 10 min walk from each school, ranging from five in the area with the lowest number of outlets to thirty in the area with the highest number of outlets. Outlets identified were heterogeneous and included fish and chip shops, kebab shops, convenience stores, newsagents, <b>bakeries,</b> <b>mobile</b> catering units, cafés, pizzerias, sandwich shops and supermarkets. Lunchtime offers and other marketing strategies targeting school pupils were observed at most outlets. Nutritional analysis of the 45 savoury food items purchased was conducted by laboratory staff.

Over a third of Scottish children are at risk of being overweight or obese, and there have been calls to strengthen the evidence base {{on the role of the}} food retail environment around schools in influencing the consumption of unhealthy foods. Methods We examined the food retail environment around five secondary schools in Glasgow city, Scotland. Trained fieldworkers observed the food purchasing behaviour of school pupils in local shops. Samples of the most popular foods were subsequently purchased by the research team and assessed for nutritional content, including energy, total and saturated fat, and salt. This was compared with the nutrient standards for school lunches established by the Scottish Government. Results There was marked variation in the number of outlets identified within a 10  min walk from each school, ranging from five in the area with the lowest number of outlets to thirty in the area with the highest number of outlets. Outlets identified were heterogeneous and included fish and chip shops, kebab shops, convenience stores, newsagents, <b>bakeries,</b> <b>mobile</b> catering units, cafés, pizzerias, sandwich shops and supermarkets. Lunchtime offers and other marketing strategies targeting school pupils were observed at most outlets. Nutritional analysis of the 45 savoury food items purchased was conducted by laboratory staff. Of the foods analysed, 49 % of the samples exceeded recommended calorie intake, 58 % exceeded total fat recommendations and 64 % exceeded saturated fat recommendations, 42 % exceeded recommended salt levels. Over 80 % of the 45 food items sampled did not comply with one of more of the nutrient standards for fat, saturated fat and salt. Meal deals and promotions of unhealthy foods aimed at pupils were widely available. Conclusions The majority of pupils purchased unhealthy convenience food of poor nutritional value at lunchtime in local shops around their school. Further effort is required to implement regulatory levers such as taxation on unhealthy foods, restriction on the concentration of outlets selling unhealthy foods as well as the development of partnerships and additional measures within and beyond schools to promote healthy foods...|$|R
