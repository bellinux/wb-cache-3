50|$|Article 5 of {{the current}} customs code (Council Regulation 2913/1992) deals with representation, a key concept. This {{provision}} allows an importer or exporter to appoint a third party to act on their behalf. The importer or exporter can appoint the third party to act in two capacities, i.e., as a direct representative or as an indirect representative. A direct representative will act {{on behalf of the}} importer/exporter but will have no responsibility for the <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> arising from their actions, whereas an indirect representative will have a joint and several liability for the <b>customs</b> <b>debt.</b> In almost all cases, the third party will elect to provide brokerage services on a direct representation basis. As a result, the importer or exporter is fully exposed to the risk or error and omission by the customs broker.|$|R

40|$|The Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on Community customs union and {{relations}} with third countries, regarding particularly customs procedure during foreign transit operations. It is aimed to summarize basic knowledge regarding TIR system operation with emphasis on its current development and modernization. At present, TIR regime is experiencing a very dynamic progress, and it is related both to its computerization {{and changes in the}} European Union, which tends to enhance safety standards on the international level when shipping the goods. Therefore, the means of communication are improved by the interconnection of main actors engaged in business transactions, such as national customs authorities and associations, traders and international organisations. The first part of the thesis deals with customs union and common trade policy of European Union. It defines the term of customs union and European customs union territory, specifies both internal and external aspects of customs union existence, and shortly describes the process of European customs union creation. The two following chapters are concerned with the customs administration, legislation and basic documentation forming customs legislation of European Union. The fourth chapter describes the development and customs union improvement with its new strategy and modernized customs union codex. The second part concentrates on the analysis of customs procedure in general and international customs regimes. It describes the basic terms used in customs administration, specifies the ways of <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> calculation and factors which may lead to the <b>customs</b> <b>debt.</b> The closing chapter is devoted to transit regimes functioning not only on the territory of the European Union, but in third countries as well. The third part addresses the TIR transit regime. At the beginning, the foundation and historical development of the regime is described, followed by its mission, principles and territorial scope. In the next chapter the basic conditions of membership are identified. The following chapter is reserved for description and explanation of international guarantee system, mutual relations of its participants and forms of guarantee provision. In the last chapter the carnet TIR - main document used for customs purposes when shipping - is highlighted.

40|$|In {{the present}} article author {{analyzes}} the institutional framework of the Customs Union of the EU and the modernized Customs Code of the EU. Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic Community. The EU Customs Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation of the customs union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field of customs cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU Customs Code occupies rules aimed at regulating the <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> and guarantees. The provisions of the new Customs Code (Section 3 of the modernized Customs Code EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union. In conclusion, author notes that all matters relating to customs policy of the European Union are regulated in the founding treaties and the rules of the Customs Code only detail the provisions of the EU founding treaties. Author also concludes that the application of the modernized Customs Code of the European Union outside the context of the founding treaties of the European Union is impossible...|$|R
40|$|Anticipating the {{ecological}} {{effects of climate}} change to inform natural resource climate adaptation planning represents one of the primary challenges of contemporary conservation science. Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor–response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (VisTrails:SAHM) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper, Pinus flexilis, Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Populus tremuloides, Abies lasciocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and Pinus albicaulis. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully <b>mature,</b> <b>custom</b> scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning...|$|R

The whole thesis is focused on comparing all three arrangements, finding out about the current situation through statistic statements. Then the situation is evaluated and particular recommendations for improvement are suggested. The practical part contains evaluation of {{the current state of}} EU market in GSP Scheme, case study, in which is calculated <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> is one of the developing countries that benefit from the preferential access to the EU market and of a country outside the EU, which does not use any benefits. These debts are then compared among each other. It is followed by a case study for which a developing country called Mozambique was chosen. It includes an interview with the staff of the Mozambican Ministry of Industry and Trade in order to obtain all the necessary information about the country, about its limits and intentions. It also includes an interview with the staff of the local customs office in České Budějovice, thanks to which information about EU Import within GSP Scheme and new trends is obtained. At {{the very end of the}} practical part is conducted a discussion. All of the obtained information and theory are then connected and recommendations for are suggested. At the very end of the practical part is a discussion, in which all the data obtained in practical part are connected with theoretical knowledge. In this discussion are proposed recommendations for improvement of the current state of business in Mozambique. Among the recommendations are to not import goods which the country is able to provide for itself, to invest money in production technology, know-how and marketing so the exported goods have higher quality and are known internationally. Countries should also address the issue of safety and regain the trust of banks and investors who have lost it in 2016 because of the scandal of unauthorized loans...|$|R

40|$|Many Americans {{insisted on}} their {{traditional}} rights as Englishmen {{in the conflict}} with Britain before and after declaring independence. Magna Carta—particularly the provisions concerning the “law of the land” and “judgment of his peers”—embodied fundamental rights of Englishmen that American revolutionaries were willing to fight to protect. As Edward Coke had found {{more than a century}} before, American revolutionaries understood that invoking such an ancient document inspired resistance to authority. Americans cherished Magna Carta most because of its association with jury trial. Juries had proved useful to Americans in their conflict with Britain. Colonial American juries had nullified the law of seditious libel, <b>customs</b> taxes, and <b>debts</b> to British merchants. It was no wonder Americans held the jury in high esteem, at least until they had to run their own governments. Americans filled their constitutions, both federal and state, with rights to jury trial. Several American states even included translations of provisions from Magna Carta in their constitutions, enshrining the “judgment of his peers. ” Once Americans had achieved independence and formed the new republics, judges faced the task of interpreting these thirteenth-century provisions as eighteenth- and nineteenth-century law. American judges quoted Blackstone and historical treatises. Through the nineteenth century, however, American enthusiasm for juries waned. The much-repeated phrases from Magna Carta became a flimsy screen, masking the steady decline of jury power...|$|R
