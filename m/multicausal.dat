He developed the [...] "compensation" [...] criteria called Kaldor-Hicks efficiency for welfare comparisons (1939), derived the cobweb model, and argued for certain regularities observable in economic growth, which are called Kaldor's growth laws. Kaldor worked alongside Gunnar Myrdal {{to develop the}} key concept Circular Cumulative Causation, a <b>multicausal</b> approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated. Both Myrdal and Kaldor examine circular relationships, where the interdependencies between factors are relatively strong, and where variables interlink in the determination of major processes.Gunnar Myrdal got the concept from Knut Wicksell and developed it alongside Nicholas Kaldor when they worked together at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Myrdal concentrated on the social provisioning aspect of development, while Kaldor concentrated on demand-supply relationships to the manufacturing sector. Kaldor also coined the term [...] "convenience yield" [...] related to commodity markets and the so-called theory of storage, which was initially developed by Holbrook Working.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, {{those who}} {{experience}} anger explain its arousal {{as a result}} of [...] "what has happened to them" [...] and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience. Such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause. The angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional, personal, and controllable aspect of another person's behavior. This explanation, however, is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability {{as a result of}} their emotion. Anger can be of <b>multicausal</b> origin, some of which may be remote events, but people rarely find more than one cause for their anger. According to Novaco, [...] "Anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental-temporal context. Disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations (of anger)." [...] According to Encyclopædia Britannica, an internal infection can cause pain which in turn can activate anger.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid [...] "hardened stories," [...] or [...] "narratives that become context-free, {{portable}} and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" [...] and are being used as conceptual metaphors as defined by linguist George Lakoff, an approach called narrative inquiry was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of random or complex <b>multicausal</b> experience by the imposition of story structures." [...] Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex data sets typically leads to narrative fallacy. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions {{on the basis of}} stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for validity and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented. Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.|$|E

METHODS: Problem-centered interviews were conducted with 78 schizophrenic patients consecutively discharged from inpatient or dayhospital treatment. RESULTS: As in the previous study, patients provided more frequently psychosocial explanations. Biological causes were relatively rarely mentioned - mostly in response to suggestions of the interviewer. In addition, they were rather brief and not very elaborated. By contrast to the previous study, hardly any indications for a <b>multicausal</b> concept could be observed.

40|$|Why do states {{behave as}} they do in world politics? Put differently, how can analysts develop a more precise and {{complete}} explanation of the causation of foreign policy behaviour? Drawing upon the insights of actor-specific Foreign Policy Analysis scholarship, this thesis argues that we need an approach which posits a human agent as an important analytical category in its own right. However, this thesis also emphasises that the state‘s foreign policy behaviour cannot be fully explained solely in terms of the actions and intentions of individual human agents. While it is indeed conscious human agents who make foreign policies, the parameters of their capacity to do so are constrained and/or facilitated by the structural conditions with which their nations are confronted. The key point here is that structural and agential sources of the state‘s foreign policy behaviour should neither be deemed exclusive nor be granted explanatory priority a priori. In this regard, this thesis presents rationales and guidelines for why and how one should pursue a <b>multicausal</b> approach to the study of foreign policy behaviour. Relatedly, it explores the structure-agent problem in international relations and rethinks currently dominant conceptions of causation in the field of IR. Then this thesis establishes a <b>multicausal</b> framework for the analysis of foreign policy behaviour. The framework consists of three factors associated with human (agential) elements and international structural conditions. With the aim of discerning the fruitfulness of the <b>multicausal</b> approach advocated here and of producing the empirical evidence that shows causation of complex foreign policy actions, this thesis undertakes intensive and comparative case study. The specific question that the case study aims to answer is why South Korea and Australia reacted to the US-led war in Iraq as they did: these two cases have neither received appropriate empirical attention nor been provided with any satisfactory theoretical explanation. The empirical findings gained from the case study leads to a testing and refinement of existing leading IR theories. Also, based on the case study findings and on the <b>multicausal</b> analytical framework built, this thesis creates an integrated theory of a particular type of foreign policy behaviour (i. e. weaker state behaviour vis-à-vis a dominant power) which encompasses both structural and agential perspectives. In a related vein, it discusses the role of theory for IR scholarship and modes of construction of IR. Ultimately it is suggested that a <b>multicausal</b> approach can contribute to the cumulative development and refinement of predictions and generalisations about why states behave {{as they do}} on the world stage...|$|E

In this study, the results showed that varied zones of inhibitions (ZME—chloramphenicol (17 – 42 [*]mm), ZME—amoxicillin (17 – 35 [*]mm), ZME—tetracycline (17 – 36 [*]mm), ZME—ciprofloxacin (20 – 41 [*]mm), ZME—nalidixic acid (17 – 34 [*]mm), and ZME—kanamycin (17 – 38 [*]mm)) were produced by the antibacterial combinations.

Although the agar diffusion assay suggested that the interactions between the ethanolic extract of Z. mucronata and the antibiotics were both synergistic and additive in nature, the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) showed that the interactions were synergistic (54. 17 %), additive (27. 78 %), indifferent (16. 67 %), and antagonistic (1. 39 %). While the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) for synergism ranged between 0. 00391 and 0. 5, that of additivity ranged between 0. 516 and 1. 0, indifferences ranged between 1. 062 and 3. 0 and antagonistic interaction was 5. 0.

40|$|In <b>multicausal</b> abductive tasks {{a person}} must explain some {{findings}} by assembling a composite hypothesis {{that consists of}} one or more elementary hypotheses. If there are n elementary hypotheses, there can be up to 2 n composite hypotheses. To constrain the search for hypotheses to explain a new observation, people sometimes use their current explanation [...] the previous evidence and their present composite hypothesis of that evidence; however, it is unclear when and how the current explanation is used. In addition, although a person's current explanation can narrow the search for a hypothesis, it can also blind the problem solver to alternative, possibly better, explanations. This paper describes a model of <b>multicausal</b> abductive reasoning that makes two predictions regarding the use of the current explanation. The first prediction is that the current explanation is not used to explain new evidence if there is a simple (i. e., non-disjunctive, concrete) hypothesis to account for that evidence. The second prediction is that the current explanation is used when attempting to discriminate among several alternative hypotheses for new evidence. These hypotheses were tested in three experiments. The results are consistent with the second prediction: the current explanation is used when discriminating among alternative hypotheses. However, the first prediction [...] that the current explanation is not used when a simple hypothesis can account for new data [...] received only limited support. Participants used the current explanation to constrain their interpretation of new data in 46. 5 % of all trials. This suggests that context-independent strategies compete with context-dependent ones [...] an interpretation that is consistent with recent work on strategy selection during problem solving. 1...|$|E
