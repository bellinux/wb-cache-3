The caste system hinders Velutha to find equality especially in his role as a laborer in the Paradise Pickles and <b>Preserves</b> <b>factory</b> and in his social relationship with the members of the society who come from the higher castes. Velutha feel that there some injustice that he faces. Therefore, I am curious to know what the reasons that make Velutha break caste system and what efforts that he does to win his struggle against caste system in relation to the ideology of Marxism. For this topic, I only choose to analyze one character " Velutha because he is very dominant in being harmed by the caste system. To analyze the novel, I use cultural approach such as the concept of Caste and Marxist theory; also, psychological theory namely the hierarchy of needs. The character in this novel tries to express his reasons to break caste system but mainly there are two reasons that cause Velutha?s desire to deconstruct caste system " the society treats him unfairly and the lose of acknowledgements to Velutha. Besides that, there are also struggles against caste system by using Marxism. However, Velutha?s struggles lead him to the unhappy ending " death. In the end of the analysis, the readers can see that the caste system is very strong and unbreakable. It is so powerful that Marxism which is considered as a classless theory cannot be applied to deconstruct caste system...|$|R

Wai Wai is pre-cooked and flavored before packaging, {{so it can be}} eaten straight from the package or cooked in soup form. The Chaudhary Group has built two plants in Nepal and six plants in India for the manufacture and distribution of Wai Wai noodles. It is expanding more new plants in Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Serbia, and Saudi Arabia. Wai Wai is mostly consumed raw but also can be consumed cooked as well. Along with other noodle brands, one segment of Wai Wai was banned in Tamil Nadu state of India in 2015 for a period of 3 months citing higher level of lead in similar noodle brand known as Maggi. Assam Government had also banned Wai Wai under investigation for one month under Food Safety and Standard Act 2006. Subsequently, concerned authorities gave the popular noodles a clean sheet as it proved to contain no lead and harmful materials. Wai Wai, which claims 20 percent market shares in the Indian market, has apparently benefited from the noodle controversy and has resurfaced in the Indian market with aggressive business plans from the Chaudhary Group.|$|R

40|$|ResumenEste artículo analiza las estrategias de intervención más destacadas desde el último tercio del siglo xx en el patrimonio {{industrial}} español y de manera particular en una de sus regiones, Castilla y León. Tras una reflexión sobre los principales agentes que han propiciado la construcción social del concepto de patrimonio industrial, se hace una síntesis crítica de las intervenciones más frecuentes en España, caracterizadas por las limitaciones de la legislación protectora, así como por una extrema tolerancia urbanísticolegal, para proponer finalmente una clasificación de las mismas. La discusión se centra, a continuación, en el análisis empírico de tres casos singulares que afectan a sectores protagonistas de la industrialización histórica en el ámbito regional de estudio: el patrimonio minero-siderúrgico en zonas de montaña (Sabero-León) y las fábricas de harina (Valladolid) y de azúcar (León capital) localizadas en áreas urbanas. Desde el punto de vista de la gestión los resultados ponen de manifiesto el carácter tardío e incompleto de las intervenciones en el patrimonio industrial, la subordinación de las acciones de puesta en valor a las estrategias urbanísticas en las ciudades, y el peso de las políticas de desarrollo local en la recuperación y uso de la herencia industrial en los contextos rurales. En todos los casos, el patrimonio industrial se perfila como un recurso de notable potencial, aunque su gestión pueda ser imperfecta y ofrecer luces y sombras. AbstractConcern {{for industrial}} heritage in Spain {{is a relatively}} recent phenomenon. Traditionally, said assets, especially those set in urban environments (isolated buildings, industrial units or full industrial landscapes) faced three main threats. First of all, a fragile social memory associated the factory with often negative vital experiences, such as manual labour, pollution, industrial accidents and death; in other words, {{the possibility of a}} resource being recognised for its cultural value depends not only on its objective qualities but also on its social acceptance; urban industrial landscape and architecture have always been viewed as an obstacle to be removed rather than a heritage to be kept (Ortega, 1998). Secondly, the basically utilitarian criterion that characterises this type of architecture hampers the conservation and reuse of industrial architectural heritage because, in contrast to other richer heritages more closely associated with the dominant culture in Western tradition, the factory building has always occupied a marginal place. Finally, industrial architectural heritage faces a major contradiction: although the factory building has hardly any value in itself and its conversion for other uses is particularly costly, the land it stands on is particularly valuable and inversely proportional to the degree of abandonment and the protective commitments it involves. Fortunately, over the last third of the 19 th century, some of these threats were overcome and some buildings, including undemolished but abandoned industrial sites, were considered elements of cultural heritage and resources used for urban economy reactivation policies and local development. This renewed interest in industrial heritage has led to the study of Sabero, a region of strong mining-industrial tradition in the province of León, and the two cases analysed in the cities of León and Valladolid (sugar factories and flour mills). However, in both cases the partial nature of the morphological recovery, the radical loss of the original function and the decontextualisation of industrial ruins {{as a result of the}} complete renovation of the “environments” detract from the ultimate goal of <b>preserving</b> the <b>factory</b> past of said two cities. Thus, this article is a theoretical reflection on a number of interventions in industrial heritage and strategies for recovery and use, viewed from a geographic perspective. It focuses interest not only on the building but also on territorial variants of the treatment given to the factory (as building), i. e. demolition, partial refurbishment, testimony, completeness, etc., and the surrounding countryside. It is based on the assumption that the presence of an industry in an area of low-level industrialisation, such as the one studied here, has completed a life cycle in which it has changed from vital resource to abandonment and consideration as an obstacle for territorial development (especially urban development) and, finally, to a resource that generates positive economic (tourism) or urban externalities (promoting the residential refurbishment of the area). All these variants of the cycle, as case studies, have already been analysed by the authors in previous research projects; however, there was a need for general theoretical reflection, which is what this article offers. The three examples selected are real-life paradigms of the industrial life cycle and the buildings in which it has developed in Castilla y León (Spain) over several generations. The findings highlight that not only preserved industrial urban areas remains with equity, also the mining areas or small industrial valleys are worthy of being retrieved and applied to new uses or projects that rescued from ruin and revalue remains. Spain have numerous in recovery actions and value of these assets, transformed into tourist resources that contribute to local development culturally, economically and socially. Slowly reorienting the focus on treatment is also observed: we move from a concentration on an isolated element or an object-monument to comprehensive interventions in heritage landscapes that link coherently scattered industrial contractors to create itineraries that explain the industrialization of the territory...|$|R
