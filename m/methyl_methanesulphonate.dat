The present study was designed to investigate the ability of baccharin to modulate the genotoxic effects induced by doxorubicin and <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> in male Swiss mice using the micronucleus and comet assays, respectively. The different doses of baccharin [0. 12, 0. 24 and 0. 48 mg/kg body-weight (b. w.) ] were administered simultaneously to doxorubicin (micronucleus test; 15 mg/kg b. w.) and to <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (comet assay; 40 mg/kg b. w.).

40|$|Summary The {{carcinogenic}} {{activity of}} the alkylating agent <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (MMS) was investigated in the F 344 rat bladder, both untreated and pretreated with a single threshold dose of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). On its own, 6 doses of 2. 5 mg MMS produced a 7 % incidence of bladder cancer. After a single intravesical instillation of MNU, the same MMS treatment produced a bladder cancer incidence of 56 %. This {{was significantly higher than}} the incidence (24 %) observed after treatment with MNU alone, and greater than the sum of the lesions produced by either treatment alone. By reference to the mouse skin multistage carcinogenesis model, it is argued that MMS is a complete, albeit weak carcinogen with little initiating but powerful late-stage activity. Its promoting activity is most probably attributable to its potent mitogenic action and in this model it is analogous to a stage 2, rather than a stage 1 skin promoter.

The REV 3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which is involved in mutagenic TLS. To investigate the role of REV 3 in vertebrates, we disruped the gene in chicken DT 40 cells. REV 3 (-/-) cells are sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents, including UV, <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (MMS), cisplatin and ionizing radiation (IR), consistent with its role in TLS. Interestingly, REV 3 (-/-) cells showed reduced gene targeting efficiencies and {{significant increase in the}} level of chromosomal breaks in the subsequent M phase after IR in the G(2) phase, suggesting the involvement of Rev 3 in HR-mediated double-strand break repair. REV 3 (-/-) cells showed significant increase in sister chromatid exchange events and chromosomal breaks {{even in the absence of}} exogenous genotoxic stress. Furthermore, double mutants of REV 3 and RAD 54, genes involved in HR, are synthetic lethal. In conclusion, Rev 3 plays critical roles in PRR, which accounts for survival on naturally occurring endogenous as well as induced damages during replication...|$|E
40|$|Third instar larvae of the Oregon R stock {{were treated}} for 25 or 30 min with vapour of <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (MMS). At various times after the {{treatment}} (4, 8 and 12 h), microscope specimens of the nerve ganglia were prepared. At {{all the times}} of fixation, only aberrations of a chromatid type were found, but with different frequencies in the two sexes. The females were about 3 times more sensitive than the males to MMS. An analysis {{of the distribution of}} the breaks between and within chromosomes showed that they were not localized at random but were clustered in the heterochromatic centromere regions of the X chromosome and the autosomes. The Y chromosome, although entirely heterochromatic, on the other hand, was highly resistant to MMS. However, this phenomenon had only a very weak effect upon the variation with sex of MMS-induced chromosome damage. Among the aberrations induced, although interchanges were normally present, neither intra-exchanges nor triradials were found. In the interchanges, there was a greater tendency for the homologous chromosomes to be involved, and these rejoined symmetrically. The above results are discussed in relation to data previously obtained with X-rays...|$|E
40|$|The {{early and}} late {{morphological}} changes induced in rat bladder urothelium by intravesicular administration of the alkylating agents <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> (MMS) and ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) are described. In the short-term, both compounds produced dose-related toxic damage followed by a regenerative hyperplasia of the urothelium. At any given dose-level, the effects of MMS were more severe than those of EMS. Two years after administration of multiple doses of 2. 5 mg MMS or 7. 5 mg EMS the majority of animals had dose-related simple urothelial hyperplasias with occasional mild dysplasia. However, in three MMS-treated animals the hyperplasias had progressed to well-differentiated transitional-cell carcinomas. No bladder neoplasms were seen in EMS-treated animals. The urothelial response of the rat to MMS and EMS is discussed {{with reference to the}} known chemical reactivity of these compounds. It is concluded that EMS is a mitogen for the urothelium and that the few carcinomas which develop following topical exposure of the bladder to MMS do not necessarily reflect any initiating potential in this compound. Rather it is argued that the results are consistent with MMS acting as a promoter in cells which have either been previously initiated or which carry a latent oncogene...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{naturally}} occuring compounds {{with the}} potential antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects are of great importance for their prospective use in cancer chemoprevention and treatment. The new water soluble derivative of microbial polysaccharide β-D-glucan-carboxymethyl glucan (CMG) belongs to such a category of natural substances. CMG isolated from the cell wall of baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is included into the class of biopolymers known as biological response modifiers (BRMs) with {{a broad range of}} activities, above all ones interfering with cancer therapy. It was demonstrated on four experimental model systems that biological and consequential medicinal impor-tance of CMG is based on the combined application with another active compound. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae antimutagenicity assay CMG significantly reduced ofloxacin-induced mutagenicity in the yeast strain D 7. CMG exerted bioprotective (anti-toxic and antimutagenic) effect after its simultaneos application with <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate</b> on the repair-deficient strain uvs 10 of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the Vicia sativa simul-taneous phytotoxicity and anticlastogenicity assay CMG exerted statistically significant anticlastogenic efect against maleic hydrazide-induced clastogenicity in Vicia sativa L. Only in the Salmonella/microsome assay CMG did not exert statistically significant antigenotoxic effect, despite {{of the fact that it}} reduced 9 -aminoacridine-induced mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA 97, but his+ revertants decreasing was statistically significant only at the highest CMG concentra...|$|E
40|$|GADD 34 {{is one of}} {{a subset}} of {{proteins}} induced after DNA damage or cell growth arrest. To examine the function of GADD 34, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to clone the protein that interacts with murine GADD 34. As bait we used the product of the partial GADD 34 cDNA, including the regions rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and threonine (PEST) and gamma(1) 34. 5 regions. A cDNA clone, named GAHSP 40, which is a mouse DnaJ family protein with a high similarity to human HLJ 1 was cloned. The interaction between GADD 34 and GAHSP 40 in cultured cells was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment and in NIH 3 T 3 cells by two-hybrid analysis in vivo. For binding of the two proteins, the gamma(1) 34. 5 -similar region of GADD 34 was necessary; however, the PEST region was also involved and the C-terminus of GAHSP 40, but not the J-domain, was important. GAHSP 40 was detected in all mouse tissues examined, but a different transcript was found in the testis. Both GADD 34 mRNA and GAHSP 40 mRNA were significantly elevated by treatment with <b>methyl</b> <b>methanesulphonate,</b> although the time courses were different. In addition, both GAHSP 40 and GADD 34 mRNA were induced by heat shock...|$|E
