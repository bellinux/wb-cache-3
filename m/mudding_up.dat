6000|$|... "I saw on {{the river}} bank a man sunk in the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to his knees. And men came to pull him out, and thrust him in up to the neck." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{there are}} mud volcanoes and mud geysers {{elsewhere}} in Yellowstone. One, the [...] "Vertically Gifted Cyclic Mud Pot" [...] sometimes {{acts as a}} geyser, throwing <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to 30 feet high.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll wager {{the trail}} is now a mass of mud and water," [...] said Phil, and he was right, and as they progressed, they {{frequently}} got into the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to their ankles.|$|R
60|$|Sam and {{the former}} teacher of Putnam Hall were soon over the side. The boy came down the plank easily enough, but Crabtree slipped {{and went into the}} water and <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to his knees.|$|R
60|$|They {{were going}} forward {{as rapidly as}} the semi {{darkness}} would permit. The ground {{was more or less}} uncertain, and once the youngest Rover went into a mud hole, splashing the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> into Jack Ness' face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't miss it," [...] {{said the}} station man, when applied to. [...] "It's {{down at the}} end of that boardwalk. If you go any further you'll sink into <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to your knees," [...] and he smiled feebly.|$|R
60|$|All gazed {{to where}} he pointed. There, {{in the water and}} mud, rested the racing car {{belonging}} to Pete Barnaby. And standing in the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to his knees was the sporty man himself, looking the picture of woeful despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hold up, or we'll {{be in the}} <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to our necks! What's the use of {{chasing a}} lot of rabbits that aren't worth eating {{at this time of}} year, when we can catch more'n a {{thousand}} squirrels between now and to-morrow morning?' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{object of}} her commiseration had {{by this time}} entered the dining-parlour, where his {{appearance}} gave great surprise. He was <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the shoulders, and the natural paleness of his hue was twice as cadaverous as usual, through terror, fatigue, and perturbation of mind.|$|R
25|$|A man {{was riding}} his sleigh to town when a Chinook overcame him. He {{kept pace with}} the wind, and while the horses were running belly-deep in snow, the sleigh rails were running in <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the buckboard. The cow tied behind was kicking up dust.|$|R
60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} the boys reached Limestone. They found three old cows stuck in the <b>mud,</b> <b>up</b> to their eyes, with only their horns and faces showing. It took long hard work to get them out. They made camp there, turning the cows and calves loose, as this was their range.|$|R
50|$|These anemones have a stem {{which extends}} through the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to one meter in length, making the anemone stationary. Each anemone has up to 200 tentacles which are white, or white and brown-striped in colour, and span up to 30cm in length. They have weak nematocysts. When disturbed, the tentacles curl up into spirals rather than retracting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{something}} of a trail," [...] announced Ben, when the others came hurrying in that direction, and he pointed to footprints which led through some soft soil between a number of low bushes. A little further on they could see where somebody's shoes or boots had carried some of the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> on to the rocks beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr Luke, if {{contrast}} brings any blessing with it," [...] said Edwin Jack, [...] "you {{ought to}} revive here, for you have splendid fresh country air--by night {{as well as}} by day--a fine laborious occupation with pick and shovel, a healthy appetite, wet feet continually, <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the eyes, and gold to your heart's content. What more can you desire?" ...|$|R
60|$|Without delay {{several of}} the sophomores promised, and {{they were allowed to}} depart. Then the others began to show fight, and three managed to escape, among them being Dudd Flockley. The others were forced into the water and <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to their knees. Then they cried out in alarm, and while two finally escaped, the others also promised to keep out of the necktie contest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{go back a}} {{bit from}} the water and come around on the other side," [...] he reasoned. Then he took to another course, only to find, presently, that {{it was worse than}} the first. He was now between clumps of reeds, and almost before he knew it one of the clumps turned over on him, sending him into the water and <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to his knees.|$|R
50|$|The Malagasy {{sacred ibis}} feeds on crustaceans, diverse invertebrates, {{vegetable}} refuse and more occasionally takes frogs, reptiles and young birds. It forages mainly on mud in tidal areas, thrusting its bill into the <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the eyes. The abbotti race on the Seychelles feeds in coral pools and along lagoon shores (King, 1981 in Hancock). Feeding is often solitary, although some individuals {{have been observed}} foraging in pairs or threes.|$|R
5000|$|David McGill writes: ‘George Dewar {{has written}} the Chaslands’ story from its heyday, in the 1890s to its lowdays in the 1950s - stories of lobster feasts, of eel for breakfast, dinner and tea, of <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to your neck, the awesome {{chopping}} of the Browdens and Jack Churchfield, and the midwife Mrs Churchfield, who always knew the sex {{and time of}} birth, something medical science has not yet bettered.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The storm {{killed at}} least 720 in the Philippines. [...] The most damage {{occurred}} in Albay Province where the storm created mudslides of volcanic ash and boulders off Mayon Volcano. The Padang barangay of Legazpi City was severely affected with {{a large portion of}} the town covered in <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to houses' roofs. At least 81 people have died and 16 people are missing in Vietnam from the storm.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't {{much of a}} camp," [...] {{said one}} who was there. [...] "We just threw out a strong picket-guard {{and went to sleep}} on our arms, and glad of it, after that day in the broiling sun. We had had to ford some pretty muddy streams, and all of us were water and <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to our knees. But {{everybody}} was as enthusiastic to fight as ever." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} around a {{tungsten}} mine and processing plant, which still stands but {{is no longer}} in operation. Town status was granted in 1955. In July 2000, the town was devastated by a massive flood and mudslide. Apartment blocks were buried in <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the fourth floor. No reliable figures exist for the number of casualties. The town has largely recovered as of 2004, but scars are still clearly visible.|$|R
5000|$|Females lay on {{the leaves}} of the shore plants up to 2000 eggs in groups of about 200. The {{resulting}} hatching larvae fall directly into the water. They live in the water at first, and later buried in the <b>mud,</b> <b>up</b> to 18 meters of depth. These larvae feed on larvae of insects, worms and small molluscs. They usually need two years to develop, overwintering as larvae. Pupation takes place on the shore under the soil.|$|R
30|$|Large tsunamis can deposit sand layers up {{to several}} tens centimeters and {{distributed}} sand layers several kilometers inland. For example, in case of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the maximum tsunami height at Lhok Nga, west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, was 35 m, and the inundation distance reached 6 km inland (Tsuji et al., 2005; Paris et al., 2007). The tsunami deposited sand up to 80 cm thick and left <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to 5 km inland (Moore et al., 2006).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{salinity}} of both {{the water and the}} <b>mud,</b> <b>up</b> to 60%, it has been speculated that Rusanda is one of the remnants of the ancient Pannonian Sea, but the lake is probably a fossil bed of the Tisza river. Records show that healing mud from the lake's bottom, peloid, has been used for therapeutic treatments at least since the 1760s. Mud therapy proved to be quite beneficial with muscle inflammation, rheumatism, gout and especially with the car crash injuries.|$|R
60|$|Once {{free of the}} City they traversed {{the open}} country, and here they often stepped into sticky, pink <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to their ankles. Cap'n Bill's wooden leg would often go down deep and stick fast in this mud, and at such times he would be {{helpless}} until two of the Pinkies--who were a strong people--pulled him out again. The parrot was getting its feathers sadly draggled in the rain, and the poor bird soon presented a wet and woebegone appearance.|$|R
40|$|The {{thickness}} {{and lateral}} distribution {{of sand and}} mud beds and bedsets on channel bars from the tidally influenced Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, are quantitatively assessed. Fifty-six vibracores totalling ca 114 m of vertical section are used to tabulate bed thicknesses. Statistical calculations are undertaken for nine channel bars ranging from the freshwater and tidal zone, to the sustained brackish water and tidal zone. The data reveal that thickness trends can be organized into three groups that broadly correspond to time-averaged hydrodynamic and salinity conditions in the various distributary channels. Thick sand beds (up to 30 cm) and thin <b>mud</b> beds (<b>up</b> to 5 cm) characterize the freshwater tidal zone. The tidal and freshwater to brackish-water transition zone comprises thin sands (up to 10 cm) and thicker <b>muds</b> (<b>up</b> to 19 cm), and the sustained brackish water tidal zone consists of thin <b>muds</b> (<b>up</b> to 6 cm) with relatively thicker sands (up to 25 cm). The {{results suggest that the}} locus of mud deposition occurs in the tidal freshwater to brackish-water zone, probably reflecting mud flocculation and deposition at the turbidity maximum. Landward of the turbidity maximum, mud deposition is linked to tidal influence (tidal backwater effect and reverse eddy currents on channel margins) as mud beds thin in the landward direction. These results support the hypothesis that mud deposition is greatest at the turbidity maximum and decreases in both the seaward and landward direction. This study also showcases that mud-bed thicknesses are greatest towards the turbidity maximum and thin in both the landward and seaward direction. In the rock record, the apex of mud deposition probably marks the position of the palaeo-turbidity maximu...|$|R
2500|$|MUD {{history has}} been {{preserved}} primarily through community sites and blogs and not through mainstream sources with journalistic repute. As of the late 1990s, a website called The Mud Connector {{has served as a}} central and curated repository for active MUDs. In 1995, The Independent reported that over 60,000 people regularly played about 600 <b>MUDs,</b> <b>up</b> from 170 <b>MUDs</b> three years prior. The Independent also noted distinct patterns of socialization within MUD communities. Seraphina Brennan of Massively wrote that the MUD community was [...] "in decline" [...] as of 2009.|$|R

2500|$|Sherry Turkle {{developed}} {{a theory that}} the constant use (and in many cases, overuse) of MUDs allows users to develop different personalities in their environments. [...] She uses examples, {{dating back to the}} text-based MUDs of the mid-1990s, showing college students who simultaneously live different lives through characters in separate <b>MUDs,</b> <b>up</b> to three at a time, all while doing schoolwork. [...] The students claimed that {{it was a way to}} [...] "shut off" [...] their own lives for a while and become part of another reality. [...] Turkle claims that this could present a psychological problem of identity for today's youths.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{eruption}} of November 30, 2006, strong rainfall which accompanied Typhoon Durian produced lahars from the volcanic ash and boulders of the last eruption killing at least 1,266 people. The precise figure may never be known since many people were buried under the mudslides. [...] A {{large portion of the}} village of Padang (an outer suburb of Legazpi City) was covered in <b>mud</b> <b>up</b> to the houses' roofs. [...] Students from Aquinas University in Barangay Rawis, also in Legazpi, were among those killed as mudslides engulfed their dormitory. Central Legazpi escaped the mudslide but suffered from severe flooding and power cuts.|$|R
