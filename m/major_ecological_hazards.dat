40|$|Current {{protection}} of the marine environment from radiation is based largely on measuring, estimating and modelling accumulation and impact(s) of radionuclides in a few marine species. Using a relevant marine organism, this thesis focusses on investigating some poorly described phenomena that could cause deviations from predicted measurements. Paper I investigated the biological transformation of tritium (radioactive hydrogen) into an organic compound. The resulting organically bound tritium (OBT) showed increased accumulation in mussels, unique incorporation into a key biological molecule (DNA), extended persistence in tissues, and greater toxicity than the inorganic form. Paper II demonstrated significant disparity in OBT accumulation between functionally similar microalgae species and that OBT in algae is readily transferred to a consumer. Highly radioactive particles are a complex issue in radioecology due to their concentrated dose geometry, potentially inducing very different impacts in organisms, compared to external irradiation. Paper III developed a method to introduce radioactive particles that would facilitate their recovery, improve dose-calculation, and aid the measurement of toxicological endpoints. It also showed that such particles {{can be incorporated into}} mussel tissues, causing significant effects. In Paper IV, hypoxia – another <b>major</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard</b> in the marine environment – was expected to reduce radiosensitivity. The minimal observable effect from radiation prevented identification of such an interaction, and indicates drawbacks in the (otherwise sensitive) endpoints used. It appears that stressors like hypoxia may be more of a health hazard to marine organisms than environmental levels of ionising radiation. By understanding such causes of variation in accumulation and impact, it is possible to improve risk assessment, providing more justification for regulations chosen and minimising conservatism in setting environmental standards. At the time of doctoral defense, the following papers were not published and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript. Paper 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: By {{the time}} of primary 21 st century, water {{hyacinth}} had become a serious environmental problem in China. Water hyacinth contributes to the <b>major</b> part of <b>ecological</b> <b>hazards</b> from the invasion of foreign plant species, which is estimated about USD 7 {{billion a year in}} values. In the past 10 years, herbicides glyphosate, 2, 4 -D and paraquat have been used in controlling water hyacinth in China. Al-though the herbicides provided effective control on the weed in some areas, they could not provide the sustainable inhibition on the weed population, while would lead to pollution on water at various levels. At present, the herbicide application on water hyacinth is forbidden in many areas of China such as Shanghai. In this situation, the asexual reproduction inhibitor, KWH 02, was invented for controlling water hyacinth and it provided about 70 % of growth inhibition without any risk of dead plant pollution. It has been about 10 years for bio-control of water hyacinth in China. Works focused on mainly the efficacy and safety of the utilization of foreign insects. Researches on microorganism herbicides to control water hyacinth were started and obtained primary achievements in recent years. Although there are different opinions on how to face the water hyacinth problem in China, it is accepted widely that the control methods should be high efficient and safe with low cost. Some practical measures for integrated management of water hyacinth are suggested...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper was}} {{attempted}} {{to investigate the}} distribution, the potential <b>ecological</b> <b>hazards</b> and the homologous relativity of heavy metals in soil of Fujian agricultural protection area on the both side of 324 National Road in Xiang'an of Xiamen City. We analyzed the content of heavy metals in the surface of farming soil using ICP-MS and evaluated the potential <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard</b> of heavy metals in the soil of agricultural protection zone in Xiang'an and further investigated the relevance of heavy metals in the soil by the classical Lars Hakanson potential ecological risk index method. Results showed that the potential <b>ecological</b> risk levels (<b>hazard</b> index) of eight kinds of heavy metals in Xiang'an area were classified in the order Cd (94. 4) > Hg (54. 3) > As (46. 7) > Pb (10. 5) > Cu (4. 3) > Ni (3. 1) > Cr (2. 3) > Zn (1. 9), and the global potential ecological risk index (HI) of heavy metal was 216. 8. The comprehensive evaluation of potential ecological risk of agricultural safety belonged to the moderate level. The major pollutants in this area were Cd and Pb, which attained the middle <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard</b> level. Through the correlation analysis of heavy metals, {{we found that the}} main external sources of pollution were the waste gas after the combustion of petrol and diesel, the excessive application of pesticides and so on.

40|$|Due {{to the use}} of {{a limited}} number of species and subchronic exposures, current <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard</b> {{assessment}} processes can underestimate the chronic toxicity of environmental contaminants resulting in adverse responses of sentinel species. Several incidences where sentinel species have responded to the effects of chronic exposure to ambient levels of environmental contaminants are discussed, including the development of neoplasia in fish, immunosuppression in marine mammals, pseudohermaphrodism in invertebrates, teratogenicity in amphibians, and aberrations in the sexual development of fish and reptiles. Biomarkers of chronic toxicity, including DNA mutations, alterations in specific protein and mRNA levels, and perturbations in metabolism, are presented. The incorporation of appropriate surrogate species and biomarkers of chronic toxicity into standard toxicity characterizations is proposed as a means of significantly refining the <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard</b> assessment process. - Environ Health Perspec...|$|R

40|$|The term “green” {{chemistry}} {{refers to}} the use of alternative chemical pathways in environmental pollution prevention. The strategy behind “green” chemistry includes the reformulation of synthetic routes so that less toxic reagents are used and/or byproducts are produced. By reducing or eliminating the use or generation of hazardous substances associated with a particular synthesis or process, chemists can effectively reduce the risk to human health and the environment. ^ Organic photochemistry is playing an increasingly important role in organic synthesis and as such the use of photochemistry can lead to alternative “greener” synthetic pathways. An inherent advantage of light is that it causes chemical transformation to occur under mild conditions without the use of strong bases, acids, oxidants or reductants. ^ A protecting group is often introduced into a molecule during a multistep synthesis to prevent a certain functional group from reacting or to direct that a chemical reaction proceeds selectively at another site of the molecule. For example, a central problem in organic synthesis is to ensure that a specific hydroxyl function in a multifunctional molecule is protected from unwanted reactions altogether or until such time as its intrinsic reactivity is required. The “green” photochemical removal of a benzyl-protecting group for alcohols was investigated under different reaction variables. In order to increase the rate of cleavage an interesting family of quinoline ethers was synthesized. ^ Epoxides are an interesting class of compounds, which are widely used in organic synthesis. Regioselective epoxidation followed by regioselective epoxide cleavage provides a powerful entry into specifically functionalized molecules. In this study the focus was to develop an efficient, environmentally benign, mild method for the photocleavage of epoxides. Light induced regioselective cleavage of epoxides was also investigated. ^ Acetonitrile is frequently used in many industrial and research operations. Its occurrence in chemical wastes presents a <b>major</b> environmental and <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard,</b> as this compound is toxic. Waste treatment with visible light (or sunlight) can offer advantages to chemical treatment. Research requiring a dye catalyzed photochemical stimulated conversion of acetonitrile to less harmful products was investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} and distribution characteristics of six heavy metals(Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni) were analyzed in 384 surface sedi-ments samples fromXiang Jiang River(Zhuzhou-Xiangtan-Changsha Reach, hereinafter {{referred to as}} Chang-Zhu-Tan Reach). Heavy metal pollution in the sediments from those areas were analyzed and evaluated by using geo-accumulation index method and potential ecological risk index method. The results indicated that the concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments from Chang-Zhu-Tan Reach which had dif-ferent variation trends, the distribution of 3 heavy metals(Cu, Pb and Zn) was contacted with regular geographic changes, the distribution of the other 3 heavy metals(Cr, Ni and Mn) was contacted with irregular geographic changes. According to the results by using geo-accumula-tion index, there were potentially heavy metals pollutions in Chang-Zhu-Tan Reach, and 4 kinds of metals(Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn) were arrived different degree of contaminations. There were serious pollution of Pb and Zn, mild or moderate pollution of Mn and Cu in Xiawan, Zhuzhou Reach(ZX 5 - 10). In Xiangtan and Changsha Reach, there existed moderate pollution of Pb and Zn, mild or moderate pollution of Cu, Mn, Ni and Cr. The potential ecological risk index indicated that the degree of heavy metal pollution in the surface sediments from Zhuzhou Reach represented high <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard,</b> Xiangtan Reach represented moderate <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard,</b> Changsha Reach represented slight <b>ecological</b> <b>hazard.</b> The results suggested that attention should be paid to the potential ecological risk of Xiawan, Zhuzhou Reach(ZX 5 - 10) ...|$|R
