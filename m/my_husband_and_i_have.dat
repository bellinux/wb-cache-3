2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

It is but a very small village, for the Moslems have killed most of us in a war that was raised a while ago between them and our hereditary prince, Magas.

I was full of hope and I was full, I suppose, of vanity and rash confidence. I thought I was walking on solid earth with my head reaching up to the clouds, and that sea and sky and all mankind were mine for the smiling. And I am nothing and worse than nothing, I am the ineffectual mother of two children, a daughter whom I adore--but of her I may not tell you--and a son,--a son who is too like his father for any fury of worship, a stolid little creature.... That is all I have done in the world, a mere blink of maternity, and my blue Persian who is scarcely two years old, has already had nine kittens. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never forgiven each other the indefinable wrong of not pleasing each other; that embitters more and more; to take it out of each other is our rôle; I have done my duty to the great new line of Justin by giving it the heir it needed, and now a polite and silent separation has fallen between us. We hardly speak except in company. I have not been so much married, Stephen, I find, as collected, and since our tragic misadventure--but there were beautiful moments, Stephen, unforgettable glimpses of beauty in that--thank God, I say impenitently for that--the door of the expensively splendid cabinet that contains me, when it is not locked, is very discreetly--watched. I have no men friends, no social force, no freedom to take my line. My husband is my official obstacle. We barb the limitations of life for one another. A little while ago he sought to chasten me--to rouse me rather--through jealousy, and made me aware indirectly but a little defiantly of a young person of artistic gifts in whose dramatic career he was pretending a conspicuous interest. I was jealous and roused, but scarcely in the way he desired. 'This,' I said quite cheerfully, 'means freedom for me, Justin,'--and the young woman vanished from the visible universe with an incredible celerity. I hope she was properly paid off and not simply made away with by a minion, but I become more and more aware of my ignorance of a great financier's methods as I become more and more aware of them....|$|E

40|$|For {{a little}} over seven years, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived in Downtown Huntington Beach, our house being a pastel yellow with white trim 1922 cottage-style house—complete with white picket fence. While there are still {{numerous}} other “historical ” homes in our area, in many cases dating from the years marking {{the construction of the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, many more have given way to new towering stucco structures with (predominately) glass facades, structures that span the 25 ’ X 117 ’ lots upon which they are built. Certainly one is struck by the contrast between the old and new in the Downtown and Old Town districts of Surf City, USA, a contrast made more visible in the twilight hours when the blue glow of cathode ray tubes spills out into the relatively still neighborhoods. Generally, the older homes emit a curtain- or shade-filtered blue glow from a single square window that sits to {{one side or the other}} of a front door. In contrast, the newer houses generate an unfiltered (by curtains or shades) and unobstructed (by 1 front door) flickering, blue rectangle, which stretches the width of the façade and the height of the first story; the rest of the structure disappears into the night. Of interest to me is what this phenomenon reveals about televisual spectatorship i...|$|E
