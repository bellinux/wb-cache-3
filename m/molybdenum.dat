5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no <b>molybdenum)</b> is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor, where <b>molybdenum</b> is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. <b>Molybdenum</b> enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. <b>Molybdenum</b> contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). <b>Molybdenum</b> increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. <b>Molybdenum</b> {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-98 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} isotope, comprising 24.14% of all <b>molybdenum.</b> Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. <b>Molybdenum</b> isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns. All unstable isotopes of <b>molybdenum</b> decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.|$|E
5|$|The <b>molybdenum</b> for steel {{production}} {{is reduced by}} the aluminothermic reaction with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum. A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% <b>molybdenum.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 86% of <b>molybdenum</b> {{produced}} {{is used in}} metallurgy, {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, <b>molybdenum</b> elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of <b>molybdenum</b> can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of <b>molybdenum.</b> Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of <b>molybdenum</b> in tissues.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} <b>molybdenum</b> can {{interfere}} with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. <b>Molybdenum</b> prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of <b>molybdenum</b> suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Low soil {{concentration}} of <b>molybdenum</b> in a geographical band from northern China to Iran {{results in a}} general dietary <b>molybdenum</b> deficiency, and is associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer. Compared to the United States, which has a greater supply of <b>molybdenum</b> in the soil, people living in those areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> coated {{soda lime}} glass is used in CIGS solar cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as <b>molybdenum</b> cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure <b>molybdenum</b> deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of <b>molybdenum</b> and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible <b>molybdenum</b> exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, <b>molybdenum</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> is the 54th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} element in its oceans, {{with an average of}} 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of <b>molybdenum</b> in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though <b>molybdenum</b> is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). <b>Molybdenum</b> is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E
5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% <b>molybdenum.</b> Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of <b>molybdenum</b> are used {{each year in}} stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role of <b>molybdenum</b> in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase enzyme involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains <b>molybdenum</b> in the active site (though replacement of <b>molybdenum</b> with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme {{is similar to that}} in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} lack of oxygen in the early ocean resulted in a scarcity in dissolved <b>molybdenum.</b> Most <b>molybdenum</b> compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>molybdenum</b> forms {{compounds}} {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} <b>molybdenum</b> in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of <b>molybdenum</b> reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. <b>Molybdenum</b> concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E
5|$|A {{vanadium}} nitrogenase {{is used by}} some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as Azotobacter. In this role, vanadium replaces {{more common}} <b>molybdenum</b> or iron, and gives the nitrogenase slightly different properties.|$|E
5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele {{correctly}} {{proposed that}} molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named <b>molybdenum</b> for the mineral {{in which it}} resided, and from which it might be isolated. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated <b>molybdenum</b> using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Like {{chromium}} {{and some}} other transition metals, <b>molybdenum</b> forms quadruple bonds, such as in Mo2(CH3COO)4. This compound can be transformed into Mo2Cl84−, which also has a quadruple bond.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> anodes replace {{tungsten}} {{in certain}} low voltage X-ray sources for specialized uses such as mammography.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> can {{withstand}} extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening, making it useful in environments of intense heat, including military armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors, and filaments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> disilicide (MoSi2) is an {{electrically}} conducting ceramic {{with primary}} use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500°C in air.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of <b>molybdenum</b> prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> has a {{value of}} {{approximately}} $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009. It maintained a price at or near $10,000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003, and reached a peak of $103,000 per tonne in June 2005. In 2008 the London Metal Exchange announced that <b>molybdenum</b> would be traded as a commodity on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molybdenum</b> powder {{is used as}} a {{fertilizer}} {{for some}} plants, such as cauliflower.|$|E
5|$|One-piece, {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome <b>molybdenum</b> steel forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven {{main bearings}} and six throws.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{lanthanum}} added to steel improves its malleability, resistance to impact, and ductility, whereas addition of lanthanum to <b>molybdenum</b> decreases its hardness {{and sensitivity to}} temperature variations.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrodesulfurization}} {{of petroleum}} uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and <b>molybdenum.</b> This process helps to clean petroleum of sulfur impurities {{that interfere with}} the refining of liquid fuels.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{oxidation}} state known for seaborgium {{other than the}} group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming chromium hexacarbonyl, <b>molybdenum</b> hexacarbonyl, and tungsten hexacarbonyl, seaborgium {{has been shown in}} 2014 to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6. Like its <b>molybdenum</b> and tungsten homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state 0 is possible with carbon monoxide as ligand, {{such as in}} <b>molybdenum</b> hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.|$|E
5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (passivating) oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. <b>Molybdenum</b> has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is <b>molybdenum</b> disulfide MoS2.|$|E
5|$|The world's {{production}} of <b>molybdenum</b> was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000t), United States (64,000t), Chile (38,000t), Peru (18,000t) and Mexico (12,000t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Mt), US (2.7Mt) and Chile (1.2Mt). By continent, 93% of world <b>molybdenum</b> production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe {{and the rest}} of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.|$|E
5|$|As {{also noted}} below, {{the most common}} isotopic <b>molybdenum</b> {{application}} involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.|$|E
5|$|Average {{daily intake}} varies between 120 and 240 μg/day, which {{is higher than}} dietary recommendations. Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have {{approximately}} 1.5 parts per million of <b>molybdenum.</b> Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers and cereal grain.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{hypothesis}} suggested {{it was possible}} that boron and <b>molybdenum</b> catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, <b>molybdenum,</b> nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, <b>molybdenum,</b> nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and <b>molybdenum,</b> and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, <b>molybdenum,</b> and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E
