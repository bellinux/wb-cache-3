40|$|A highly {{enantioselective}} one-pot {{synthesis of}} important building blocks, α-chiral γ-keto esters, {{has been developed}} by combining a quinine-catalyzed Michael addition of malononitrile to trans-enones followed by <b>magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate</b> (MMPP) oxidation. These synthons proved to be useful reagents for a simple access to challenging cis-α,γ-disubstituted γ-butyrolactones in good diastereoselectivity and high enantiocontrol. (Figure presented.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate</b> (MMPP) is a {{water-soluble}} {{peroxy acid}} {{used as an}} oxidant in organic synthesis. Its main areas of use are the conversion of ketones to esters (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation), epoxidation of alkenes (Prilezhaev reaction), oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones, oxidation of amines to produce amine oxides, and in the oxidative cleavage of hydrazones.|$|R

In all the cases, {{the formation of}} the VX N-oxide 7 was observed prior to the subsequent oxidation and hydrolysis into the nontoxic O-ethyl methylphosphonate 2. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate</b> (MMPP) {{is probably one of the}} most active reagents to achieve the complete detoxification of VX 1.

40|$|A new water-soluble, salen [salen = bis(salicylidene) ethylenediamine]-based ligand, 3 was developed. Two of {{the metal}} {{complexes}} of this ligand, i. e., 3 a, [Mn(III) ] and 3 b, [Ni(II) ], {{in the presence of}} cooxidant <b>magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate</b> (MMPP) cleaved plasmid DNA pTZ 19 R efficiently and rapidly at a concentration similar to 1 mu M. In contrast, under comparable conditions, other metal complexes 3 c, [Cu(II) ] or 3 d, [Cr(III) ] could not induce any significant DNA nicking. The findings with Ni(II) complex suggest that the DNA cleavage processes can be modulated by the disposition of charges around the ligand...|$|R

The molecular structure of this cage revealed that it possesses a barrel-shaped architechture. The cage structure is built by the cumulative coordination action of phosphonate, hydroxide, and pyrazolyl ligands. A similar reaction involving Cu(NO 3) 2 * 3 H 2 O, t-BuP(O) (OH) 2, 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole, and triethylamine afforded another dodecanuclear cage [Cu 12 (μ-DMPz) 8 (η 1 -DMPzH) 2 (μ 4 -O) 2 (μ 3 -OH) 4 (μ 3 -t-BuPO 3) 4] * 3 MeOH (3). The latter is crownshaped and is built by the coordination of pyrazole, pyrazolyl, phosphonate, hydroxide, oxide, and methanol ligands. Both of the dodecanuclear cages are efficient nucleases {{in the presence of}} <b>magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate...</b>|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Interest grew {{in the development of}} new oxidising agents as a replacement for high purity meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) and avoiding the difficulty in obtaining high strength hydrogen peroxide. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>monoperoxyphthalate</b> (MMPP) has been advertised as a replacement. However due to problems of solubility of this oxidant in a number of solvents, it cannot be considered as a complete substitute for mCPBA. An oxidising agent is required to either complement MMPP, or succeed mCPBA entirely. This thesis describes the investigation of some hydrogen peroxide adducts as a possible contender to the extremely versatile oxidant, mCPBA. Urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) in combination with either trifluoroacetic or acetic anhydride was used for the in situ formation of percarboxylic acids. Oxidations of various functional groups were carried out using these peracids. Reactions include: the epoxidation of terminal, electron deficient alkenes, such as octene, by trifluoroperacetic acid; the epoxidation of electron rich alkenes, such as styrenes and cyclohexenes, by peracetic acid; Baeyer-Villiger reactions of both aliphatic and alkyl aryl ketones by trifluoroperacetic acid; the conversion of anilines into nitrobenzenes; the oxidation of tertiary amines and sulphides; and the oxidative cleavage of dimethylhydrazones. A number of other hydrogen peroxide adducts were produced and their performance in various oxidation reactions was compared to that of ureahydrogen peroxide. Experiments in the formation of adducts to induce chirality in epoxidation reactions were also undertaken...|$|R
