Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

In 2007, he said, [...] "We <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> our destiny, our earthly road, is that of rebuilding the connection with Divinity, with God." [...] Although an Orthodox, Pascu went on pilgrimage to the Roman Catholic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes.|$|E
500|$|Duerr {{argues that}} modern Western society lacks {{important}} facets found in [...] "archaic" [...] societies who adhere to shamanic beliefs, and {{he asserts that}} the majority of Western anthropologists who have performed ethnographic fieldwork in these cultures have failed to truly understand them. To correct this, Duerr argues that anthropologists <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> people in such societies take a [...] "mythic perspective" [...] to the world, often comparing objects and places in the material world to objects and places that exist [...] "outside of time", in the eternal realm of mythology. He connects this with the Indigenous Australian concept of Dreamtime, an otherworld outside of ordinary space and time.|$|E

Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was [...] "not used to working". Blanc also stated that the striker needed to shed weight in order to fulfill his potential.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States warned Yugoslavia against {{shelling}} Albanian territory. State Department spokesman James Rubin {{told reporters}} that the alleged shelling was likely an attempt to prevent the insurgents from re-entering Kosovo. [...] "If true, the shelling represents an unacceptable violation of Albanian territory." [...] He continued. [...] "Belgrade <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> such shelling {{runs the risk of}} further escalating the current conflict." [...] Rubin said that the U.S. was opposed {{to the creation of a}} pan-Albanian state, and emphasized that calls for its establishment were a [...] "very dangerous development that could affect the stability of the region." [...] Russian officials accused KLA fighters of stoking the clashes, and called for peace talks between the militants and Yugoslav authorities. On July 19, Albanian officials requested that Greece—an important trading partner for Albania and traditional ally of Serbia—mediate to end the fighting. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos issued a condemnation, saying [...] "these senseless acts of violence must stop." [...] The European Union condemned the militant incursion, as well as the alleged cross-border shelling.|$|E
500|$|Landis held {{hearings}} in late January 1915, and newspapers expected a quick decision, certainly before spring training began in March. During the hearings, Landis admonished the parties, [...] "Both sides <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> any blows at the thing called baseball would be regarded by this court as {{a blow to}} a national institution". When the National League's chief counsel, future Senator George Wharton Pepper referred to the activities of baseball players on the field as [...] "labor", Landis interrupted him: [...] "As a result of 30years of observation, I am shocked because you call playing baseball 'labor.'" [...] Landis reserved judgment, and the parties waited for his ruling. Spring training passed, as did the entire regular season and the World Series. In December 1915, still with no word from Landis, the parties reached a settlement, and the Federal League disbanded. [...] Landis made no public statement as to the reasons for his failure to rule, though he told close friends {{that he had been}} certain the parties would reach a settlement sooner or later. Most observers thought that Landis waited because {{he did not want to}} rule against the two established leagues and their contracts.|$|E
