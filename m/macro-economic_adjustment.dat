This paper is to measure Taiwan's economic marginalization by an international policy coordination approach instead of the conventional free trade agreements. We simulate <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> of Taiwan and its main economic partners (China and the US) according to the different institutional scenarios and economic shocks.

However, the resulting unsterilized interventions fuel the domestic money supply and might lead to high levels of inflation later on. Therefore, some questioned the sustainability of the hryvnia peg. In a first step to more exchange rate flexibility, the Ukrainian monetary authorities implemented a one-shot revaluation of 5 % against the dollar in April 2005. This paper estimates a small macro-economic model of the Ukrainian economy. Simulations of alternative exchange rate paths are undertaken and the resulting <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> compared to analyze the effects of different exchange rate strategies. These simulations suggest that in the current conditions allowing the exchange rate of the hryvnia to appreciate in an orderly manner might be a good alternative for a rigid peg to the dollar or irregular ad-hoc exchange rate changes...|$|R

30|$|Third, {{given that}} the {{macro-economy}} was under the threat of stagflation, a working opposing policy mix was an expansionary fiscal policy (to cushion {{the impact of the}} crisis) and a moderately tight monetary policy. When the crisis had passed, a mix of a moderately tight fiscal policy and a moderately loose monetary policy seemed more appropriate as the government gradually shed of the role of stimulating the economy. However, to achieve this directional transition, investment and financing activities should have been conducted under a market-led mechanism rather than a government-led mechanism. If not, market forces {{would never be able to}} take over the role of expansionary fiscal policy in influencing the market, even in prosperous times. Given imbalances in the national economy and the international balance of payments, an opposing policy mix that aims to solve both problems at once can only work with market-set interest and exchange rates. If this prerequisite cannot be met, <b>macro-economic</b> policy <b>adjustment</b> cannot touch upon the international balance of payments. As the above mechanism condition could not be met, China adopted an opposite policy mix from Western countries. The policy mix resulted in considerable short-term growth, unfortunately, at high long-term cost.|$|R

40|$|The EU's {{development}} strategy towards its Southern near abroad resembles the development economic Leitmotiv {{of the early}} Nineties, i. e. the Washington Consensus with its three pillars of <b>macro-economic</b> stabilisation, structural <b>adjustment</b> and liberalisation. Beyond that, however, it rests on the modernisation theoretical basis paradigm developed by Seymour Martin Lipset in 1959. In accordance with the optimistic convergence hypothesis, both the European Commission and the Council of Ministers assume that economic development correlates positively {{with the creation of}} democratic structures in the Third Countries of the Mediterranean (TCM). In other words, economic liberalisation, as a prerequisite for both the introduction of Euro Mediterranean Free Trade and the expansion of the Euro-Mediterranean trade exchange, should lead to increasing prosperity {{as well as to the}} formation and the widening of middle class actors. These should, in turn, due to their newly acquired participation rights in the economic area, almost inevitably demand further participation in the political realm. Ideally, this would be followed by a political liberalisation process that encompasses the whole Southern Mediterranean area and that will result in a democratisation of all the TCM. Based on this assumption and the concept of incomplete contracting, this study aims to show two interrelated insights: 1.) that the main goal of the Barcelona Process, i. e. to contribute to the socio-economic development in the TCM, has not been achieved during its first five years; 2.) that the envisaged modernisation theory-inspired spill-over from the economic to the political level was severely hampered. It will be shown that the Euro-Mediterranean trade nexus, which appears as the primary tool for the realisation of the EMP's above mentioned objective, has been adjusted to the needs of EU-European market providers while the asymmetrical structure of Euro-Mediterranean trade-which was already visible during the approche globale and the subsequent 'Renovated Mediterranean Policy'-as been further aggravated to the disadvantage of the TCM. The paper concludes with some remarks related to the linkage between the structure of Euro-Mediterranean trade relations and the explanatory power of modernisation theory. international relations; Mediterranean...|$|R

Second, we use the dataset on bilateral cross-border claims and liabilities to establish a long-term panel cointegration relationship between GDP, housing prices and net bank capital flows.

40|$|Considerable {{uncertainty}} remains {{about the}} human impact of macroeconomic adjust-ment. Analysis {{of the impact of}} adjustment on the poor and on the social sectors is difficult because it involves evaluating a counter factual situation in which households are affected by prices, incomes, and public services with the possibility of substantial substitutions—all within an economywide framework with complicated concurrent and lagged interactions. In this article, we utilize time-series data for Jamaica to examine whether macroeconomic adjustment, initiated in the early 1980 s but intensified in 1984 — 85, was associated with significant deterioration in various indicators of health, nutritional, and welfare outcomes, particularly among the poor. Although we find evidence of substantial cuts in governmental expenditures on social services, there is little confirmation of significant short-run deterioration in human capital indicators during the adjustment period. There has been much interest recently in analyzing the impact of <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> and stabilization policies on poverty and on the social sectors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the Dutch social-economic model that has proved so {{successful}} in recent years.

The Dutch experience learns that in redesigning social security systems or facilitating <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment,</b> a dialogue between unions, employers' organizations and the government is a valuable asset. Countries that expand existing collective social security schemes or introduce new schemes should pay close attention to possible adverse labor market incentives associated with badly designed programs. Collective social insurance of the European kind might not {{be the best way to}} achieve income protection for countries with a high share of workers employed in the informal sector. We discuss individual accounts as a possible alternative and conclude that both social security principles have their pros and cons.

40|$|Policy {{conditionality}} {{has been}} a frequently used tool {{in the context of}} the Euro zone crisis management. By linking the disbursement of loan instalments to specific policy requirements the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> programmes used conditionality as leverage to promote structural reforms. How does conditionality induce policy change? This central question is examined by considering conditionality as a ‘mega’ policy instrument that seeks to guide the domestic policy system and define its reform trajectory. Policy conditionality thus determines the areas of reform and prescribes their direction while also defining the means and timeframe within which they have to be implemented. Conditionality impacts on domestic governance and transforms the policy making system into a compliance and implementation mechanism. The paper argues that the reform potential of conditionality relies on its interaction with the domestic political system and policy process. A public policy lens can help to better understand the dynamics inherent in this process as well as highlight the strengths and limitations of conditionality. Following the conventional stages of public policy, the contribution focuses on the political challenges involved and sketches out a prospective empirical research agenda...|$|E

Endowed with significant natural resources, including ample fertile land, regular rainfall, and mineral deposits, it appears poised for rapid economic growth and development at independence (Okello-Obura 2011). However, chronic political instability and erratic economic mismanagement produced a record of persistent economic decline that left Uganda among the world's poorest and least-developed countries (United States, Bureau of African Affairs 2007).

Between April and June 2003, a Field Inquiry on {{the implementation of the}} Programme of Action was conducted by UNFPA in 16 CDCC members. The Field Inquiry was designed to capture progress achieved and difficulties encountered by countries in implementing the various commitments and recommendations contained in the ICPD Programme of Action and in the Key Actions for its Further Implementation (ICPD+ 5). The Field Inquiry assessed major sections of the Programme of Action: population and development; gender equality, equity and empowerment of women; reproductive health and rights; behaviour change communication and advocacy; partnerships; resources; data, research and training; and indicators. This information was completed with data provided to a list of socio-economic and demographic indicators, which was administered to all ECLAC/CDCC Member and Associate Member States The report provides an overview of the major economic, social and demographic trends observed in the Caribbean over the past decade, including sector reform and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment,</b> globalisation and their impact on population issues and concerns. Furthermore, it reflects the assessment of the implementation of the Programme of Action at the sub-regional and national levels conducted by governments and civil society. This includes an analysis of the interrelationships between population, sustained economic growth and sustainable development, issues related to migration patterns, gender equality and the implementation of reproductive health and rights. It also examines the impact of HIV/AIDS and the responses of the Caribbean to the epidemic, as well as the special needs of two age groups, adolescents and older persons.

40|$|The initial ‘framing’ (in {{the summer}} of 2012) of the ‘genuine EMU’ for the wider public {{suggested}} to design an entire series of ‘unions’. So many ‘unions’ are neither necessary nor desirable – only some are and their design matters. The paper critically discusses first the negative fall-out of the crisis for EMU, and subsequently assesses the fiscal and the banking unions as accomplished so far, without going into highly specific technical details. The assessment is moderately positive, although there is ample scope for further improvement and a risk for short-term turbulence once the ECB has finished its tests and reviews. What about the parade of other ’unions’ such as economic union, social union and political union? The macro-economic imbalances procedure (MIP) and possibly the ESRB have overcome the pre-crisis disregard of macro competitiveness. The three components of ‘economic union’ (single market, economic policy coordination and budgetary disciplines) have all been strengthened. The last two ‘unions’, on the other hand, would imply {{a fundamental change in}} the conferral of powers to the EU/ Eurozone, with drastic and possibly very serious long-run implications, including a break-up of the Union, if such proposals would be pushed through. The cure is worse than the disease. Whereas social union is perhaps easier to dismiss as a ‘misfit’ in the EU, the recent popularity of suggesting a ‘political union’ is seen as worrisome. Probably, nobody knows what a ‘political union’ is, or, at best, it is a highly elastic notion: it might be thought necessary for reasons of domestic economic reforms in EU countries, for a larger common budget, for some EU tax power, for (greater) risk pooling, for ‘symmetric’ <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> and for some ultimate control of the ECB in times of crisis. Taking each one of these arguments separately, a range of more typical EU solutions might be found without suggesting a ‘political union’. Just as ‘fiscal capacity’ was long an all-or-nothing taboo for shifting bank resolution to the EU level, now solved with a modest common Fund and carefully confined but centralised powers, the author suggests that other carefully targeted responses can be designed for the various aspects where seen as indispensable, including the political say of a lender-of-last-resort function of the ECB. Hence, neither a social nor a political union worthy of the name ought to be pursued. Yet, political legitimacy matters, both with national parliaments and the grassroots. National parliaments will have to play a larger role...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. Fiscal deficits, {{which are}} {{the end result of}} fiscal indiscipline and lack of fiscal space, have been the focus of fiscal and {{macroeconomic}} adjustment in developed and developing countries. Developments in the euro zone between 2007 and 2011, have reminded policy makers about the macro-economic dangers posed by government debt. The nasty experiences of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain forced policy makers in Europe to introduce painful austerity measures. Up to this day, the eurozone debt crisis threatens the survival of the European Union. Although most African countries were not directly affected by the contagion of the euro zone debt crisis, they too had their own structural problems of unsustainable fiscal deficits and bad governance which caused macroeconomic imbalances. This study examines the macroeconomic effects of fiscal deficits and the contribution of bad governance to macroeconomic instability in Zimbabwe. In chapter one the problem and methodology of the study are introduced. The key questions are basically whether deficits are harmful or neutral? Linked to this is of course, the political economy of these deficits, especially the method of financing them and how this affects the macro-economic equilibrium. In order to investigate these issues, this study uses a qualitative and comparative methodology which juxtaposes Zimbabwe’s experiences with those of other developing countries, namely Ghana, Morocco, Zambia and Botswana. These countries are chosen as they collectively depict both cases of good fiscal management (Botswana and Morocco) on the one hand, and bad fiscal management (Ghana and Zambia), on the other. This methodology adequately captures political economy issues which are not capable of being estimated without running the risk of lack of validity and spurious inferences given the softness of data under hyperinflationary conditions that occurred in Zimbabwe prior to 2009. In chapter two the study examines various theoretical propositions on the relationship between the fiscal deficit and selected macroeconomic variables. The traditional theory postulates that the fiscal deficit has a negative impact on macroeconomic performance whereas the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem posits that the impact of the deficit is neutral. Keynesians argue that deficits arising from public expenditure on investment as opposed to consumption actually crowd-in rather than crowd out private sector investment. In theory, there is a close connection between a monetized deficit and inflation. A positive theoretical relationship is also found between the twin deficits (that is, the trade and fiscal deficits). However, the relationship between the budget deficit, interest rates and exchange rate is ambiguous. In chapter three we find that the majority of empirical studies support the view that budget deficits are generally inflationary when they are financed by printing money. A causal link is also found between the budget deficit and trade deficit. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between the deficit, exchange rate and interest rates is largely ambiguous. The comparative politico-economic and fiscal experiences of Ghana, Zambia, Morocco and Botswana in chapter four are used to provide the trajectory for the Zimbabwean case study in chapter 5. The review of the experiences of Ghana and Zambia showed that fiscal indiscipline resulted in high fiscal deficits which led to the deterioration of macroeconomic performance whereas in Morocco and Botswana, fiscal discipline resulted in low fiscal deficits and improved macro-economic performance. But central to the politico-economic performance of these countries, was the issue of bad governance and how this worsened the impact of fiscal deficits. In chapter five the experiences of Zimbabwe confirm the view that fiscal deficits are harmful to the economy. Many years of fiscal indiscipline and bad governance, led to macro-economic instability that resulted in record hyperinflation levels in 2008. Finally, the study concludes that, cumulative fiscal deficits in Zimbabwe since 1980, precipitated macroeconomic instability and fiscal unsustainability. Prolonged fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, which were largely financed by printing money, triggered hyperinflation and macroeconomic disequilibria. The lack of fiscal probity and the profligacy of the state, corruption, macroeconomic mismanagement and dirigistic policies, all rolled into one, caused the unprecedented economic meltdown and eventual economic collapse in Zimbabwe. The study finds that fiscal indiscipline in Zimbabwe, other than causing macroeconomic instability, also contributed to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, never witnessed in a country not waging a war. Going forward, the study recommends a battery of policy measures in the area of institutional, fiscal and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> in order to control and manage the deficit in Zimbabwe...|$|E
