Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{machining}} parameters on the surface integrity of hard <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The residual stress distribution of hard <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces</b> is characterized by compressive stresses in the range between 150 and 1000 MPa. Typically, residual stresses in the feed direction are more compressive above a depth of 12. 7 mm, while residual stresses in the cutting direction are more compressive below a depth of 12. 7 mm. The micro-hardness distribution of hard <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is characterized by a}} lower surface hardness and a stable bulk hardness. It is noted that a higher cutting speed induces a more softened layer. The machining-induced residual stress and micro-hardness distribution can increase the crack initiation life by 39 per cent, while increasing the crack propagation life by more than four times. Accordingly, it can increase the fatigue life by more than three times. The results are presented that demonstrate that the machining parameters significantly influence the residual stress and micro-hardness distribution of hard <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces</b> and that the fatigue performance of hard <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the machining parameters...|$|R

A filament in the light beam traveling direction from the beam waist is formed by the auto-focusing action due to the laser beam propagation in the work is formed.
