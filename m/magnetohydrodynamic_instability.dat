The differential rotation of the disk acts to twist the B field in the space outside the disk thus generating a toroidal magnetic field.

The Edge Snake consists of a radially and poloidally strongly localized current wire, in which the temperature and density profiles flatten. This significant reduction in pressure gradient leads to a reduction in the neoclassical Bootstrap current and can plausibly explain the drive of the instability.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> and waves are {{analyzed}} for a current sheet {{in the presence of}} a small normal magnetic field component varying along the sheet. These waves and instability are related to existence of two gradients of the tangential and normal magnetic field components along the normal and tangential directions with respect to the current sheet. The current sheet can be stable or unstable if the multiplication of two magnetic gradients is positive or negative. In the stable region, the kink-like wave mode is interpreted as so called flapping waves observed in the Earth's magnetotail current sheet. The kink wave group velocity estimated for the Earth's current sheet is of the order of a few tens kilometers per second.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} to efficient magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (MPDT) operation is the onset of high-frequency voltage oscillations as the discharge current is increased above a threshold value. The onset regime is closely related to <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> known as kink modes. This work documents direct observation of the formation and quasi-steady state behavior of an argon discharge plasma in a MPDT operating at discharge currents of 8 to 10 kA for a pulse length of approximately 4 ms. A high-speed camera images the quasi-steady-state operation of the thruster at 26, 143 fps with a frame exposure time of 10 micro s. A 0. 9 neutral density filter and 488 -nm argon line filter with a 10 -nm bandwidth are used on separate trials to capture the time evolution of the discharge plasma. Frame-by-frame analysis of the power flux incident on the CCD sensor shows both the initial discharge plasma formation process and the steady-state behavior of the discharge plasma. Light intensity levels on the order of 4 - 6 W/m 2 indicate radial and azimuthal asymmetries in the concentration of argon plasma in the discharge channel. The plasma concentration exhibits characteristics that suggest the presence of a helical plasma column. This helical behavior has been observed in previous experiments that characterize plasma kink mode instabilities indirectly. Therefore, the direct imaging of these plasma kink modes further supports the link between MPDT onset behavior and the excitation of the <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities...</b>|$|R

In this work we review the recent developments pertaining to twisted magnetic flux tubes and compare quantitative predictions to observations. Hydrodynamic theory predicts a role for twist in preventing fragmentation. Excessive twist can also lead to <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> affecting the dynamics of the tube's axis.

Significant decrease in sawtooth period is observed for EC injection inside the inversion radius in co-direction: the normalized sawtooth period 251 / 7 "(0) l' 5 reaches 1 / 10 {{of that in}} an ohmic heating phase, which shows a strong destabilization effect (here, f 51 and 7 "(0) are sawtooth period and the central electron temperature, respectively). While time scale for {{the change in the}} sawtooth amplitude is comparable to that in the inversion radius, time scale for the change in the sawtooth period is much shorter than that in the inversion radius. This suggests that the change in the sawtooth amplitude is related to the current profile, and that the strong destabilization effect of the sawtooth period occurs independently of the change in the current profile.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of 2 D {{simulations}} of the magnetorotational model of a supernova explosion. After the core collapse the core consists of rapidly a rotating proto-neutron star and a differentially rotating envelope. The toroidal part of the magnetic energy generated by the differential rotation grows linearly with time at the initial stage {{of the evolution of}} the magnetic field. The linear growth of the toroidal magnetic field is terminated by the development of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability,</b> leading to drastic acceleration in the growth of magnetic energy.

40|$|Magnetic reconnection, {{the process}} whereby {{magnetic}} field lines break and then reconnect {{to form a}} different topology, underlies critical dynamics of magnetically confined plasmas in both nature and the laboratory. Magnetic reconnection involves localized diffusion of the magnetic field across plasma, yet observed reconnection rates are typically much higher than can be accounted for using classical electrical resistivity. It is generally proposed that the field diffusion underlying fast reconnection results instead from some combination of non-magnetohydrodynamic processes that become important on the ‘microscopic’ scale of the ion Larmor radius or the ion skin depth. A recent laboratory experiment demonstrated a transition from slow to fast magnetic reconnection when a current channel narrowed to a microscopic scale, but did not address how a macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic system accesses the microscale. Recent theoretical models and numerical simulations suggest that a macroscopic, two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic current sheet might do this through a sequence of repetitive tearing and thinning into two-dimensional magnetized plasma structures having successively finer scales. Here we report observations demonstrating a cascade of instabilities from a distinct, macroscopic-scale <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> to a distinct, microscopic-scale (ion skin depth) instability associated with fast magnetic reconnection.

40|$|The {{electric}} current {{and the associated}} magnetic field in aluminium electrolysis cells create effects limiting the cell productivity and possibly cause instabilities: surface waving, ‘anode effects’, erosion of pot lining, feed material sedimentation, etc. The instructive analysis is presented via a step by step inclusion of different physical coupling factors affecting the magnetic field, {{electric current}}, velocity and wave development in the electrolysis cells. The full time dependent model couples the nonlinear turbulent fluid dynamics and the extended electromagnetic field in the cell, and the whole bus bar circuit with the ferromagnetic effects. Animated examples for the high amperage cells are presented. The theory and numerical model of the electrolysis cell is extended to the cases of variable cell bottom of aluminium layer and the variable thickness of the electrolyte due to the anode non-uniform burn-out process {{and the presence of}} the anode channels.

40|$|Macroscopic gas motions are {{widespread}} {{throughout the}} solar atmosphere and shearing motions couple to the non [...] ideal effects, destabilising low frequency {{fluctuations in the}} medium. The origin of this non-ideal <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> lies in the collisional coupling of the neutral particles to the magnetized plasma {{in the presence of}} a sheared background flow. Unsurprisingly, the maximum growth rate and most unstable wavenumber depend on the flow gradient and ambient diffusivities. The orientation of the magnetic field, velocity shears and perturbation wave vector play a crucial role in assisting the instability. When the magnetic field and wave vector are both vertical, ambipolar and Ohm diffusion can be combined as Pedersen diffusion and cause only damping; in this case only Hall drift in tandem with shear flow drives the instability. However, for non-vertical fields and oblique wave vectors, both ambipolar diffusion and Hall drift are destabilizing. We investigate the stability of magnetic elements in the network and internetwork regions. The shear scale is not yet observationally determined, but assuming a typical shear flow gradient ∼ 0. 1 s^- 1 we show that the magnetic diffusion shear instability grows on a time scale of one minute. Thus, it is plausible that network [...] internetwork magnetic elements are subject to this fast growing, diffusive shear instability, which could play an important role in driving low frequency turbulence in the plasma in the solar photosphere and chromosphere.

40|$|A popular {{model for}} jet {{collimation}} {{is associated with}} the presence of a large-scale and predominantly toroidal magnetic field originating from the central engine (a star, a black hole, or an accretion disk). Besides the problem of how such a large-scale magnetic field is generated, in this model the jet suffers from the fatal long-wave mode kink <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>instability.</b> In this paper we explore an alternative model: jet collimation by small-scale magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are assumed to be local, chaotic, tangled, but are dominated by toroidal components. Just {{as in the case of}} a large-scale toroidal magnetic field, we show that the ``hoop stress'' of the tangled toroidal magnetic fields exerts an inward force which confines and collimates the jet. The magnetic ``hoop stress'' is balanced either by the gas pressure of the jet, or by the centrifugal force if the jet is spinning. Since the length-scale of the magnetic field is small (< the cross-sectional radius of the jet << the length of the jet), in this model the jet does not suffer from the long-wave mode kink instability. Many other problems associated with the large-scale magnetic field are also eliminated or alleviated for small-scale magnetic fields. Though it remains an open question how to generate and maintain the required small-scale magnetic fields in a jet, the scenario of jet collimation by small-scale magnetic fields is favored by the current study on disk dynamo which indicates that small-scale magnetic fields are much easier to generate than large-scale magnetic fields.
