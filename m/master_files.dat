Auditors must perform or review reconciliations between SAP and external information such as bank reconciliation and A/P statement reconciliation. They must review cost center and responsibility accounting, management review and budgetary control and the route of authorization for non-routine transactions. The audit review should include a review of validation of data that is input in certain transactions, the design of ABAP statements and their authority checks matching documents prior to closing. Also, {{with regard to the}} master file control there must be an independent review of master file changes and creation of transactional responsibilities to identify any redundant <b>master</b> <b>files.</b>|$|E

DNS {{data can be}} stored either in <b>master</b> <b>files</b> (also known as zone files) or in the Active Directory database itself. In the latter case, since Active Directory (rather than the DNS server) handles the actual replication of the database across multiple machines, the database can be modified on any server ("multiple-master replication"), and the addition or removal of a zone will be immediately propagated to all other DNS servers within the appropriate Active Directory [...] "replication scope". (Contrast this with BIND, where when such changes are made, the list of zones, in the /etc/named.conf file, has to be explicitly updated on each individual server.) ...|$|E

50|$|With {{the release}} of Shrieker in 1998, Band {{enlisted the help of}} Ohio-based filmmaker and Tempe Entertainment founder J.R. Bookwalter, who had {{recently}} relocated to California. Bookwalter was commissioned by Band to begin editing features, including Curse of the Puppet Master. Curse of the Puppet Master, created due to demand from video retailers for a new installment of the Puppet Master franchise, is not held in high regards with fans of the genre. To conserve costs (as most Full Moon features were being made for much less than the Paramount-distributed films), the film was put together using footage from the first five Puppet <b>Master</b> <b>files,</b> as well as some new footage. However, Bookwalter's work got Full Moon noticed on Apple.com, where a story was published about Bookwalter's editing of Curse of the Puppet Master on his iBook in a hotel room in Ohio.|$|E

Although recording in the basement was less than pleasant, the band found it [...] "cheaper than a real studio," [...] with Mercer noting that [...] "it only costs sixty bucks to buy deadbolts for the doors." [...] Near the end of the recording process, the band was robbed of the computer they recorded on. [...] "So the <b>master</b> <b>files</b> are now in some crack addict's basement," [...] Mercer told Rolling Stone in 2003. Having cut ties with a bad relationship and a bad job, Mercer felt his songwriting reflected a broader perspective as a result. During the recording process, keyboardist Marty Crandall and his girlfriend, Elyse Sewell, saw a television advertisement for America's Next Top Model and joked that she should try out. Host Tyra Banks called his girlfriend a week later, and Sewell went on to win third prize on America's Next Top Model, wearing [...] "three different Shins T-shirts" [...] on the program.|$|E
50|$|The first {{applications}} of computers to medicine and healthcare in Brazil started around 1968, with {{the installation of}} the first mainframes in public university hospitals, and the use of programmable calculators in scientific research applications. Minicomputers, such as the IBM 1130 were installed in several universities, and the first applications were developed for them, such as the hospital census in the School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto and patient <b>master</b> <b>files,</b> in the Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo, respectively at the cities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo campuses of the University of São Paulo. In the 1970s, several Digital Corporation and Hewlett Packard minicomputers were acquired for public and Armed Forces hospitals, and more intensively used for intensive-care unit, cardiology diagnostics, patient monitoring and other applications. In the early 1980s, with the arrival of cheaper microcomputers, a great upsurge of computer applications in health ensued, and in 1986 the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was founded, the first Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics was held, and the first Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics was published. In Brazil, two universities are pioneers in teaching and research in Medical Informatics, both the University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Sao Paulo offer undergraduate programs highly qualified in the area as well as extensive graduate programs (MSc and PhD). In 2015 the Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, also started to offer undergraduate program.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} {{is also used}} in conjunction with regular complete backups. The <b>master</b> <b>file</b> is backed up at regular intervals. Completed transactions since the last backup are stored separately and are called journals, or journal <b>files.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>file</b> can be recreated by restoring the last complete backup and then reprocessing transactions from the journal files.
