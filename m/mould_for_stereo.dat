After analyzing {{the properties of}} design and the manufacture of side pattern on <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> auto lamp, key technology, such as grouping, sorting, determination of continuity, fairing and fitting of side pattern curves, generating of NC files and G codes, are presented. Using out-process redeveloping tools of CATIA V 5, a CATIA V 5 integrated side pattern CAD/CAM system <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> of auto lamp is developed. At last, a practical example shows that the technology and the software satisfy the design and manufacture of side pattern on <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> auto lamp. The technology and the software {{have been used in}} related enterprise successfully...|$|R
