The predictions of pipeline burst pressure in the early stage are very important {{in order to provide}} assessment for future inspection. The effects of {{the multiple}} aligned axial cracks on burst pressure of <b>material</b> <b>Grade</b> B was studied through an experimental and numerical simulation. The objectives of this research are to investigate the effects of multiple aligned axial cracks towards the burst pressure. This research focuses on two types of analysis which is experimental and simulations by using <b>material</b> <b>Grade</b> B pipe with outer diameter of 60. 5 mm, 600 mm in length and thickness of 4 mm. The burst test is done by applying internal pressure of hydraulic oil continuously at the pipe with artificially machined cracks until the pipe burst.

A half of the pipe was modeled by considering the symmetrical conditions using the same parameter with a pipe that used in the burst test. In both analyses of experiment and simulation, the stress and strain are used as criteria for predicting the failure of the pipe.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} {{of this work}} is to discuss a scheme for modeling the <b>material</b> <b>grading</b> and structures of heterogeneous objects. To model the <b>material</b> <b>grading</b> of a heterogeneous object, a termed 'grading source' is defined. The grading sources are reference features, which specify the type and position of <b>grading,</b> and a <b>material</b> <b>grading</b> function for controlling the material variation within the geometric boundary of the objects. Within the proposed modeling scheme, a concept on representing objects, which are both heterogeneous in material and structure (e. g. composite laminates), will also be elaborated. For downstream layered manufacturing purposes, a contour sub-division algorithm on each layer arising from slicing a heterogeneous object is proposed. Within each slice, the <b>material</b> <b>grading</b> is decomposed into sub-contours according to the different grading variation. A parameter called 'grading step-width' is defined to control the number of sub-contours and resolution of the grading. With such discretization, it is, therefore, possible to build a heterogeneous object on layered manufacturing machines of different fabricating precision specification. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Due to the operational loads, changes in the pipe horizontal and vertical alignment, and variations in the soil type, axial loads and bending moments are generated along the pipeline. Through the {{wall thickness}} transition, stress concentrations develop due to the differences in pipe geometry, stiffness, <b>material</b> <b>grade</b> and mechanical strength. Current engineering practice and standards provide guidance on back-bevel design for wall thickness transitions. An alternative configuration, the counterbore-taper design recommended by TranCanada PipeLines, is intended to reduce stress concentration effect across the transition, facilitate welding processes, and improve NDT quality, productivity and reliability. Through a parametric study, using finite element methods, the relative mechanical response of the back-bevel and counterbore-taper wall thickness transition is evaluated. The numerical modelling procedures are verified with analytical equations and numerical simulations available {{in the public domain}} literature. The influence of element type, mesh topology, wall thickness mismatch (t₂/t₁), <b>material</b> <b>grade</b> on the limit load, pressure containment response, associated with the onset of plastic collapse, are evaluated.
