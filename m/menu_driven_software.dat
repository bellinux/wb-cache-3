There are two sorts of costs involved when one uses software: the fixed cost {{of learning to}} use a piece of software and the the variable cost of operating the software. For example <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> <b>software</b> is easy to learn, but tedious to operate. I show that a monopoly provider of software generally invests the "right" amount of resources in making the software easy to learn, but too little in {{making it easy to}} operate. In some extreme cases a monopolist may even make the software too easy to learn. ...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence Analysis (CA) is {{a popular}} tool for archaeological data analysis, {{appropriate}} for use with tables of non-negative number. The technique allows the visual display of the associations between the rows and between the columns of a data matrix, and the relationships between them. Archaeologists {{with this kind of}} data often have no problem in understanding the ideas behind CA, but with limited training in statistics may have problems in implementing it. Commercial, <b>menu</b> <b>driven,</b> statistical <b>software</b> packages of the type used for service teaching in universities are expensive and restrictive in the way results from a CA can be presented. Archaeologists outside the university sector may not have access to such software. This paper is a guide to how the open-source software R can be used to undertake CA. R is a sophisticated, ‘state-of-the-art’ package that is constantly updated. It is not <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> and can seem forbidding to new users. The paper provides a detailed account, ranging from installation of the package through to real applications of CA, that has helped, and we hope will continue to help, encourage the use of CA among archaeologists who have previously been discouraged from engaging with it...|$|R
5000|$|A {{goal for}} the new systems was user-friendliness; one {{executive}} stated, [...] "Does the end user care about {{the architecture of the}} machine? The answer is no. 'What will it do for me?' That's his major concern. ... why try to scare the consumer off by making it so he or she has to have a double E or be a computer programmer to utilize the full capabilities of a personal computer?" [...] Cartridges would for example, Atari believed, make the computers easier to use. To minimize handling of bare circuit boards or chips, as was common with other systems of that period, the computers were designed with enclosed modules for memory, ROM cartridges, with keyed connectors to prevent them being plugged into the wrong slot. The operating system boots automatically, loading drivers from devices on the serial bus (SIO).

40|$|In a work environment, it is {{important}} to identify and quantify the relationship among work activities, working posture, and workplace design. Working posture may impact the physical comfort and well-being of individuals, as well as performance. The Posture Video Analysis Tool (PVAT) is an interactive <b>menu</b> and button <b>driven</b> <b>software</b> prototype written in Supercard (trademark). Human Factors analysts are provided with a predefined set of options typically associated with postural assessments and human performance issues. Once options have been selected, the program is used to evaluate working posture and dynamic tasks from video footage. PVAT has been used to evaluate postures from Orbiter missions, as well as from experimental testing of prototype glove box designs. PVAT can be used for video analysis in a number of industries, with little or no modification. It can contribute to various aspects of workplace design such as training, task allocations, procedural analyses, and hardware usability evaluations. The major advantage of the video analysis approach is the ability to gather data, non-intrusively, in restricted-access environments, such as emergency and operation rooms, contaminated areas, and control rooms. Video analysis also provides the opportunity to conduct preliminary evaluations of existing work areas...|$|R

40|$|A semi-automated {{procedure}} is described for the accurate determination of geometrical characteristics using a scanned {{image of the}} tire cross-section. The procedure can be useful for cases when CAD drawings are not available or when {{a description of the}} actual cured tire is desired. Curves representing the perimeter of the tire cross-section are determined by an edge tracing scheme, and the plyline and cord-end positions are determined by locations of color intensities. The procedure provides an accurate description of the perimeter of the tire cross-section and the locations of plylines and cord-ends. The position, normals, and curvatures of the cross-sectional surface are included in this description. The locations of the plylines provide the necessary information for determining the ply thicknesses and relative position to a reference surface. Finally, the locations of the cord-ends provide a means to calculate the cord-ends per inch (epi). <b>Menu</b> <b>driven</b> <b>software</b> has been developed to facilitate the procedure using the commercial code, PV-Wave by Visual Numerics, Inc., to display the images. From a single user interface, separate modules are executed for image enhancement, curve fitting the edge trace of the cross-sectional perimeter, and determining the plyline and cord-end locations. The code can run on SUN or SGI workstations and requires the use of a mouse to specify options or identify items on the scanned image...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOne {{of the significant}} problems of this "information age" is the production of vast amounts of information {{in a form that}} is neither convenient nor cost effective. This information is most often produced and distributed on paper and the resultant effort in production, distribution and retrieval is herculean. A possible solution to this, is the new optical laser technology and its use in the storage and retrieval of large amounts of information. Through the use of this technology in the non-classified areas of the Department of Defense the effort in all three areas can be greatly reduced and the end user can become more efficient. In many areas of DOD, the greatest benefit would be the regained space and weight associated with the distribution of the manuals and other typically paper products on a Compact Disc - Read Only Memory (CD-ROM). One CD-ROM weighs less than an ounce and is capable of storing over 270, 000 pages of text. The saved shipping and handling costs alone would be astronomically reduced not to mention the end user who would have a more effective and efficient product. The CD-ROM is designed to work as a peripheral device to a microcomputer and can therefore be made available to any user with an IBM compatible microcomputer. The application/demonstration portion of this thesis took over 2 million database records, from the Transaction Ledger On Disc (TLOD), at the Naval Supply Center (NSC) in Oakland and pressed them to a single CD-ROM. The <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> retrieval <b>software</b> with indexing on 3 criteria was also provided. It is evident that optical laser discs, principally in the form of CD-ROM, are more than just an innovative technology, indeed, they have an important part in the future of the U. S. Navy, of the Department of Defense, and all of our nation. The storage and retrieval of information is to be dramatically effected by this technology. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaOver {{the last}} several years, the Data Systems Technology Division (DSTD) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has {{developed}} software tools to generate simulated spacecraft data to support the development, test, and verification of prototype and production of its Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) telemetry data systems. Recently, these data simulation tools have demonstrated their versatility and flexibility in the testing and deployment of several very high performance Level Zero Processing (LZP) systems. Because LZP involves the wide scale reordering of transmitted telemetry data, the data simulation tools were required to create {{a number of very}} large and complex simulated data sets to effectively test these high rate systems. These data sets simulated spacecraft with numerous instrument data sources downlinking out-of-sequence and errored data streams. Simulated data streams were encapsulated in Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet and NASCOM data formats. The knowledge and expertise gained {{in the development of the}} current simulation tools has been used to develop a new generation data simulation tool, known as the Simulated Telemetry Generation (STGEN) package. STGEN is a <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> <b>software</b> package running on UNIX platforms that can implement dynamic test scenarios with very fast turn around times from the data set design to the data set generation. The error options and locations in the telemetry data stream are fed via simple programs which are in turn script-driven. Scripts are used to manipulate packets, frames, and permit error insertion more easily and quickly. This paper first describes the STGEN software package and its test data design strategies. It then provides an example of STGEN 's first usage in the testing of systems to support EOS-AM spacecraft. Finally, a description of future planned improvements and uses of STGEN are provided...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{experimental}} setup in detail and demonstrate its capabilities. A three dimensional finite element model is utilized to model the magnetic field distribution due to the probe and how the probe voltage changes as it scans the crack. Experimental data of the probe for different samples under zero load, static load and high cycle fatigue load will be discussed. The final section summarizes the major accomplishments of the present work, {{the elements of the}} future R&D needs and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using this system in the laboratory and field. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The experimental setup consists of a tensile testing machine, a two axis scanner and controller, the self nulling probe and its instrumentation and a PC to control all the instruments and for the storage of information. The scanner is attached to the load frame and has the flexibility to be placed anywhere vertically depending on the sample size and cross head location. Resolution of the motors in the controller is 10 microns in both directions. Figure 1 shows the specimen, probe and the controller mounted on the tensile testing machine. The self nulling probe has been discussed in detail in a number of publications [2] - [4]. The most unique feature of this probe is the self-nulling capability that significantly simplifies the instrumentation for the probe. Also the probe provides a well defined local maximum voltage near the crack tip which is exploited in this application. <b>Menu</b> <b>driven</b> <b>software</b> controls the loading procedures and the controller movements during the test.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} an automated, telephonic system {{to monitor the}} progress of patients convalescing at home. The system includes a computerized central station {{that is capable of}} automated voice communication over the telephone, using voice reproduction, and touch-tone recognition. Peripheral hardware in multiple monitored homes need include only a touch-tone telephone, but may also be augmented by inexpensive, rudimentary diagnostic aids, such as a scale for body weight, a thermometer, or a blood pressure cuff and manometer. Current central hardware includes a NeXT computer, a fax modem, and a specialized telecommunications modem developed specifically for voice telecommunication using the NeXT. The central station acts like a robotic nurse in that it asks patients a series of questions and records the responses. The subjective questions to be asked are patient individualized and pre-selected by the physician from a question menu including items targeted specifically for the patient 2 ̆ 7 s disease or condition. In addition, clinical data such as body weight, blood pressure, and body temperature obtained from in-home diagnostic aids may be transmitted to the central station over the telephone using touch tones. The time-of-day and frequency of calling are pre-selectable, according to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s preference and clinical status. Data obtained by the central station can be easily accessed by the duty nurse via <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> <b>software.</b> Reports depicting significant responses as a function of time are generated in graphical format to facilitate rapid identification of adverse trends. Hard copy reports can be dispersed directly by fax. Results from a pilot study show patients with cardiac disease readily use the system without difficulty or complaints. In one patient a five pound increase in body weight was detected, which prompted the patient 2 ̆ 7 s cardiologist to adjust his medication. In this way automated telephone follow-up can provide early detection of complications before they become severe, making the home environment safer and more secure for convalescence and contributing to reduced health-care costs...|$|E
