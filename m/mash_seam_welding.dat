40|$|ABSTRACT. Weld strength, formability, {{and impact}} {{resistance}} for joints on auto-motive steels {{are dependent on}} the under-lying microstructure. A martensitic weld area is often a precursor to reduced me-chanical performance. In this paper, ef-forts are made to predict underlying joint microstructures {{for a range of}} processing approaches, steel types, and gauges. This was done first by calculating cooling rates for some typical automotive processes [re-sistance spot welding (RSW), resistance <b>mash</b> <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> (RMSEW), laser beam welding (LBW), and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) ]. Then, critical cooling rates for martensite formation were calcu-lated for a range of automotive steels using available thermodynamically based phase transformation models. These were then used to define combinations of process type, steel type, and gauge where welds could be formed avoiding marten-site in the weld area microstructure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Seam</b> <b>welds</b> {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow extrusion profile type which has <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, only a slight change was observed in <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength.

The experimental profile was produced in different temperatures, billet temperatures and ram speeds by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones.

Findings: Some structural differences are occurred between having the different extrusion parameters both <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> and without weld regions, when the experimental results are observed. In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures. This situation decreases the significance of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> lines. Moreover, the grain size is getting smaller with increasing ram speed as it is shown in microstructural figures.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{results of}} <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> of relatively high temperature melting materials, AISI 304, C-Mn steels, Ni-based alloys, CP Cu, CP Ni, Ti 6 Al 4 V and relatively {{low temperature melting}} material, AA 6061. It describes the <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets. The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod (CP Mo or AISI 304) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure. As soon as the distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet, an axial force was applied. After an initial dwell time, the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length, thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets. Multi-track and multi-metal <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of high temperature metallic sheets, AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloys, Cp Cu, Ti 6 Al 4 V and low temperature metallic sheets, AA 6061 were obtained. Optical and scanning electron microscopy examination and 180 degree U-bend test indicated that defect free <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> could be obtained with this method. Tensile- shear testing showed that the <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA 6061 was weaker due to softening. The metallurgical bonding at the interface between the metallic sheets was attributed to localized stick and slip at the interface, dynamic recrystallization and diffusion.

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength.

However, <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength.

40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above.

The mechanical properties of these profiles are deeply affected by the <b>seam</b> <b>welds,</b> which are generated in hollow profiles along the whole length. The <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> result from the rejoining of the material streams in the welding chamber of the porthole die. The joining phase and hence the <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> quality are strongly influenced by the temperature and the pressure conditions in the welding chamber.

In this work, the focus lies on the feeder section of the extrusion die, which consists of a set of bridges, whose shapes influence the material entry in the welding chamber. A numerical study was carried out to investigate different bridge shapes with regard to the pressure inside the welding chamber and the punch load. Subsequently, the volume of the bridge was fixed to isolate and better investigate the influence of the shape. It was observed that bridge designs leading to higher flow distortion cause higher pressure decrement along the welding plane and, consequently, degradation of the welding conditions...|$|R

The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot <b>welding,</b> <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds.

The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current.
