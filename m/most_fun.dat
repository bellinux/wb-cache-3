5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He and Madonna {{really had a}} great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to see}} that side of her. This was by far the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> I've ever had making a video.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Italy, and directed by Tom Munro. It shows Madonna escaping the paparazzi {{on the back of}} a convertible. She travels throughout the city and the Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video and labeled it as Madonna's <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E
5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom was the <b>most</b> <b>fun,</b> yet the hardest work {{compared with other}} characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E

5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> in designing original mecha, {{thinking about how}} a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E
5|$|Bowie {{performed}} {{several of}} the album's songs during a press tour that preceded his highly theatrical Glass Spider Tour, which played to a combined audience {{of as many as}} six million fans. Bowie wanted to produce a live show that picked up where his aborted 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour left off. Although considered financially successful and well attended, the tour itself was critically dismissed. Bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid the problems that the Glass Spider Tour was criticized for by avoiding overly theatrical stage presentations and focusing on his music. Despite the criticism, Bowie maintained that performing on this tour was the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> he had had on tour up to that point in his career.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{also felt}} the {{pressure}} of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered {{earlier in the year}} with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal {{as a member of the}} Flames. He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E

5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E
5|$|GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann {{opened his}} review by calling Burnout 3: Takedown {{one of the}} best racing games of all time, noting that it stood out among contemporaries in the diverse and {{expanding}} genre. He felt the quality of the game was high enough to recommend it to gamers who were impartial to driving games. Edge magazine regarded Burnout 3 to be Criterion's finest work to date; they thought the studio had demonstrated their proficiency by revising the series structure and dynamic. They were also mindful of how Burnout 3s offered a fun and exhilarating experience while other developers were prioritising realism in their games. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the addition of significant gameplay mechanics had helped craft one of the most addictive racing games ever made. GamesTM awarded it a perfect score; they proclaimed that Burnout 3 was without a doubt the greatest racing game ever made and described playing it as the <b>most</b> <b>fun</b> they had ever had in the genre. GameSpy reviewer Miguel Lopez, who also awarded the game a perfect score, remarked that it was possibly the best arcade racer ever made.|$|E

The film was shot on 35mm Panavision in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio with Metrocolor film, Carpenter's first experience with Panavision cameras and lenses.
