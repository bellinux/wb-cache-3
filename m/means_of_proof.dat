6000|$|In {{ordinary}} cases, {{they require}} two witnesses {{to prove a}} fact; and therefore they held, [...] "that, if there be but one witness, and no probable grounds of presumption of some kind (nulla argumenta), that one witness {{is by no means}} to be heard"; and it is not inelegantly said in that case, Non jus deficit, sed probatio, [...] "The failure is not in the law, but in the proof." [...] But if other grounds of presumption appear, one witness is to be heard: [...] "for it is not necessary that one crime should be established by one sort of proof only, as by witnesses, or by documents, or by presumptions; all the modes of evidence may be so conjoined, that, where none of them alone would affect the prisoner, all the various concurrent proofs should overpower him like a storm of hail." [...] This is held particularly true in cases where crimes are secret, and detection difficult. The necessity of detecting and punishing such crimes superseded, in the soundest authors, this theoretic aim at perfection, and obliged technical science to submit to practical expedience. [...] "In re criminali," [...] said the rigorists, [...] "probationes debent esse evidentes et luce meridiana clariores": and so undoubtedly it is in offences which admit such proof. But reflection taught them that even their favorite rules of incompetence must give way to the exigencies of distributive justice. One of the best modern writers on the Imperial Criminal Law, particularly as practised in Saxony, (Carpzovius,) says,--"This alone I think it proper to remark, that even incompetent witnesses are sometimes admitted, if otherwise the truth cannot be got at; and this particularly in facts and crimes which are of difficult proof"; and for this doctrine he cites Farinacius, Mascardus, and other eminent Civilians who had written on Evidence. He proceeds afterwards,--"However, this is to be taken with a caution, that the impossibility of otherwise discovering the truth is not construed from hence, that other witnesses were not actually concerned, but that, from the nature of the crime, or from regard had to the place and time, other witnesses could not be present." [...] Many other passages from the same authority, and from others to a similar effect, might be added; we shall only remark shortly, that Gaill, a writer on the practice of that law the most frequently cited in our own courts, gives the rule more {{in the form of a}} maxim,--"that the law is contented with such proof as can be made, if the subject in its nature is difficult of proof."[48] And the same writer, in another passage, refers to another still more general maxim, (and a sound maxim it is,) that the power and <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> ought not to be narrowed, but enlarged, that the truth may not be concealed: [...] "Probationum facultas non angustari, sed ampliari debeat, ne veritas occultetur."[49] ...|$|E

50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon is {{generally}} decisive {{in the success}} or failure of the action for infringement. If it is correctly performed and cannot be challenged or remains unchallenged, it will provide evidence of an infringement for which the judge ruling on the merits in the infringement proceedings cannot but pronounce civil or criminal sanctions, thereby ensuring the success of the holder of the intellectual property right over the infringer. If it is incorrectly performed, challenged and declared void, it generally leads to the failure of the infringement action on the merits as it fails to produce evidence of the infringement. All other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> certainly remain effective in theory, but in practice, they are far from being as efficient as the saisie-contrefaçon, to the extent that the failure of the saisie-contrefaçon often means that the infringement action will fail.|$|E

50|$|Ordeals also {{referred}} to as Divya were divine methods of proof. They decided what cannot be or is not to be decided by human <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b> The general rule stated by Yājñavalkya, Narada, Brahaspati, Katyayana is that ordeals are to be retorted to only if there is no human evidence or circumstantial evidence available. Different kinds of ordeals are mentioned at different places, Manu gives only two ordeals i.e. holding of fire and plunging in water. Yet Yājñavalkya and Vishnu give a list of five, namely balance, fire, water, poison, consecrate water. Narada gives seven different types of ordeals, i.e. ordeal by balance, fire, water, poison, libration, rice, hot piece of gold. Though there has been evidence found that shows the practice of only two ordeals i.e. ordeal by rice and ordeal by sacred libation. They show up in the sources from ancient Kashmir. In the final decisions by the King human modes of proof ruled over divine modes of proof. Ordeals were only used in extraordinary circumstances. There are also more restrictions on who can perform what type of ordeal. Ordeals were generally performed in the presence of King, the judge, learned Brahmans and the public. The place and time where the ordeals could be performed also held importance. They were usually administered either at dawn or in the forenoon or sometimes even late at night. Sunday was the preferred day to administer them. They usually took place at places like temple, royal gate, public place where four roads meet and the hall of justice. The chief judge by the order of the King had to conduct all the rites like a sacrificial priest. The chief judge and the Sodhya had to take religious dips, observe a fast and convoke all deities.|$|E
5000|$|Vyāsa {{describes}} the following kinds of decisions: by valid <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> (document, witnesses, possession), by motives (inferences and logical speculation), by customs (local rules established {{for a long}} time), by an oath, by a royal decree, or by reconciliation of the parties. Nārada classifies the decisions in a different way, differentiating between sacred law, positive law, custom, and royal decrees. Sacred law refers to a decision in which “a case has been duly investigated, decided in accordance with circumstance, and examined by means of oaths, it should {{be known as a}} decision by the sacred law.” Positive law, on the other hand, is a decision made based upon the prescriptions. A decision is determined by custom if it is made according to local rules and the customs of the people. A royal decree is “when kings consider a particular custom to be contrary to equity, in the same way this custom should be annulled by a royal decree.” The punishment of the defeated party is related to the reply of the accused. A defendant who lost the case after delivering a reply by way of denial, exception, or former judgment should pay the disputed amount to the plaintiff and an equal amount to the king. If the defendant wins, the plaintiff should pay a fine twice as high as the amount mentioned in the plaint. In the case of a confession, the defendant pays half the fine he would pay if he had denied the plaint and was defeated. Certain guidelines must be followed in determining the fine for the defeated party. For example, Kātyāyana explains the fines to be given in trials of ordeals: “In case of poison, water, fire, the balance, holy water, rice, and the ordeal by the hot piece of gold, he should inflict fine on the defeated according to the following gradation: a thousand, six hundred, five hundred, four, three, two, and one hundred, and less.” ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this workshop is to stimulate the research on proof production and exchange {{in the field of}} computer aided deduction. Machine-checkable proofs have been proposed for applications like proof-carrying code and certified compilation, as well as for exchanging knowledge between different automated reasoning systems. For example, interactive theorem provers can import results from otherwise untrusted high-performance solvers, by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>proofs</b> the solvers produce. In such situations, one automated reasoning tool can make use of the results of another, without having to trust that the second tool is sound. It is only necessary to be able to reconstruct a proof that the first tool will accept, in order to import the result without increasing the size of the trusted computing base. This simple idea <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> exchange for theorem proving becomes quite complicated under the realworld constraints of highly complex and heterogeneous proof producers and proof consumers. For example, even the issue <b>of</b> a standard <b>proof</b> format for a single class of solvers, like SMT solvers, is quite difficult to address, as different solvers use different inference systems. It may be quite challenging, from an engineering and possibly also theoretical point of view, to fit these into a single standard format.
