5|$|Urey and Murphy {{calculated}} from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 <b>millilitre,</b> which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, they traveled to the cryogenics laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known at Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per <b>millilitre</b> of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E

25|$|The gold {{standard}} for detection of bacterial overgrowth is the aspiration of more than 105 bacteria per <b>millilitre</b> from the small bowel. The normal small bowel has less than 104 bacteria per <b>millilitre.</b> Some experts however, consider aspiration of more than 103 positive if the flora is predominately colonic type bacteria as these types of bacteria are considered pathological in excessive numbers in the small intestine. The reliability of aspiration in the diagnosis of SIBO has been questioned as SIBO can be patchy and the reproducibility can be as low as 38 percent. Breath tests have their own reliability problems with {{a high rate of}} false positive. Some doctors factor in a patients' response to treatment as part of the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Quantities of liquids are {{measured}} in units of volume. These include the SI unit cubic metre (m3) and its divisions, {{in particular the}} cubic decimeter, more commonly called the litre (1 dm3 = 1 L = 0.001 m3), and the cubic centimetre, also called <b>millilitre</b> (1cm3 = 1 mL = 0.001 L = 10−6 m3).|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestine}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} (SIBO), also termed bacterial overgrowths, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS), is a disorder of excessive bacterial {{growth in the}} small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria, the small bowel usually has fewer than 10,000 organisms per <b>millilitre.</b> Patients with bacterial overgrowth typically develop symptoms including nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss and malabsorption, which {{is caused by a}} number of mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} method is {{collecting}} {{the blood from}} the donor's vein into a container. [...] The amount of blood drawn varies from 200 <b>millilitres</b> to 550 <b>millilitres</b> depending on the country, but 450–500 <b>millilitres</b> is typical. [...] The blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag that also contains sodium citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and sometimes adenine. [...] This combination keeps the blood from clotting and preserves it during storage. [...] Other chemicals are sometimes added during processing.|$|R
50|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50 <b>millilitres</b> to 150 <b>millilitres</b> gives 200 <b>millilitres.</b> However, if a measure of 5 feet is extended by 2 inches, the sum is 62 inches, since 60 inches is synonymous with 5 feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|R

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bacterial overgrowth {{is made by}} a number of techniques, with the gold standard being an aspirate from the jejunum that grows in excess of 105 bacteria per <b>millilitre.</b> Risk factors for the development of bacterial overgrowth include dysmotility; anatomical disturbances in the bowel, including fistulae, diverticula and blind loops created after surgery, and resection of the ileo-cecal valve; gastroenteritis-induced alterations to the small intestine; and the use of certain medications, including proton pump inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without chondroitin sulfate (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per <b>millilitre</b> at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9 - 15 micromolar following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3 - 0.7 micromolar with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 fold lower than that required to {{have a positive effect on}} the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158ng/mL compared to 89ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.|$|E
500|$|There are {{typically}} 40 million bacterial cells in {{a gram of}} soil and a million bacterial cells in a <b>millilitre</b> of fresh water. There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies and bacteria {{are responsible for the}} putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. In March 2013, data reported by researchers in October 2012, was published. It was suggested that bacteria thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest known part of the oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, [...] "You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} methods of obtaining blood from a donor. [...] The most {{frequent}} is to simply take the blood from a vein as whole blood.

[...] A typical donation is 450 millilitres (or approximately one U.S. pint) of whole blood, though 500 <b>millilitre</b> donations are also common.

2500|$|In November 2007, Hingis {{called a}} press conference to {{announce}} that she was under investigation for testing positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, during a urine test taken by players at Wimbledon. Hingis' urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per <b>millilitre</b> of benzoylecgonine. The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter states that [...] "the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml." [...] As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.|$|E
