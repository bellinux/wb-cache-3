The police remained outside for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, taking these preliminary measures, while the assailants were raping and murdering the women inside the house.

5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. He caught a train and arrived at the ground <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour {{after the start of}} play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E

The judge presiding was Kennon C. Whittle.|$|E
25|$|The true {{difficulty}} of the stage was demonstrated by the time gaps and finishing groups. Most of the riders finished the stage alone; {{no more than five}} finished together. Only 18 other riders finished within ten minutes of Riccò's winning time, and 78 lost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, with 's Franck Renier last on the day 40 minutes and 10 seconds off the pace.|$|E

He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, {{the third}} day became a nightmare. On a typical Sri Lankan turning track, Muralitharan {{finished}} with the fine figures of six for 18, as the Bangladeshis were bamboozled.

25|$|Allied {{aircraft}} {{had already}} reported {{the position of}} the German ships about 1300. About the same time a lone German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor sighted and attacked both cruisers only to be repelled by anti-aircraft gunfire. The German aircrew immediately turned north-east, reporting {{the position of the}} British cruisers <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour later to Erdmenger. Captain Charles Clark on HMS Glasgow, assuming that he had been reported then also turned north-east, working around Erdmenger's position to intercept. The sea was becoming rougher and the wind had increased to 30 knots, making sailing difficult for the destroyers and torpedo boats.|$|E
25|$|Remark {{that the}} {{concepts}} 'access' and 'improved' are not unequivocal. The definitions {{used by the}} WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation do not necessarily coincide {{with those of other}} surveys or national policies. The government of Burkina Faso, for instance, takes into account aspects such as waiting time and water quality. In fact, almost half of the Sub-Saharan households that according to WHO/UNICEF 'have access to improved water supply', spend <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour a day collecting the water. Although this loss of time is mentioned in the WHO/UNICEF report, it does not affect their 'improved' vs. 'non-improved' distinction.|$|E
25|$|Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe {{broke the}} fork of his bicycle. This {{was the third}} time in his career that this happened. He walked to the top, and down the entire descent before he could fix it. He {{finished}} the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to put it back on. He also had a cold, and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, and was then third in the general classification.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} innings, Caddick {{showed signs of}} {{returning}} to his best and took good advantage of {{the deterioration of the}} pitch, using good short-of-a-length deliveries to pick up six wickets and put England in a commanding position, needing just 194 to win. Curtly Ambrose (6–24) was at his most devastating, removing Atherton and Smith very early, and Ramprakash being run out, putting England in dire straits. Only Stewart managed to get into double figures, and only he and Thorpe survived <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour at the crease facing the menace of Walsh and Ambrose, and by the close on the fourth day, England were reeling at 40/8, still 5 short of their lowest score in Tests.|$|E
25|$|Buemi and Davidson {{were chosen}} to qualify the car and took third with a two-lap average lap time that was two-tenths slower than the pole-sitting No. 1 Audi. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour after the race started, Sarrazin drove around {{the outside of the}} slower No. 32 Lotus T128 of Dominik Kraihamer to lap him, but Kraihamer lost control of his car's rear end and went into Sarrazin's side. Both drivers made high speed contact with the turn three tyre barrier. The damage to the No. 8 Toyota's {{steering}} was too great, forcing it to retire. At the inaugural 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas held three weeks later, Sarrazin and Buemi qualified the car in third position, 1.3 seconds off the lead No. 2 Audi car's pace, and Sarrazin could not improve following Jan Charouz's No. 32 Lotus T128 hitting his rear-end, sending the TS030 Hybrid spinning at the first turn. In a race affected by hot weather, Buemi moved into second immediately after a fifteen-minute safety car period and challenged the No. 1 Audi for the lead before the pit stop cycle. Toyota achieved strong performance through better tyre management, enabling the No. 8 car to finish second. Going into the team's home event, the 6 Hours of Fuji, the manufacturer announced that two TS030 Hybrid cars would take part in the race.|$|E

500|$|Early on September 16, Washington {{received}} reports, {{which proved}} to be unfounded, that the British were advancing. Washington, who had been expecting an attack, had ordered a party of 150 men {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to reconnoiter the British lines. [...] At daybreak, Knowlton's troops were spotted by the pickets of the British light infantry. The British sent two or three companies to attack the enemy to their front. For <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour the skirmish continued, with fighting in the woods between two farms. When Knowlton realized that the numerically superior British forces were trying to turn his flank, he ordered a retreat, which was conducted [...] "without confusion or loss", although perhaps ten men had been lost in the initial skirmish.|$|E
500|$|Male giraffes {{use their}} necks as weapons in combat, a {{behaviour}} known as [...] "necking". Necking {{is used to}} establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on {{the weight of the}} skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.|$|E
500|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped at the {{beginning}} of the second session, the track was still damp and all drivers initially ran on intermediate tyres.

Sebastian Vettel set the fifth fastest time while driving the most timed laps of the session at nineteen. Sainz, fastest in first practice, heard [...] "strange noises" [...] from his power unit, but eventually finished seventh fastest. Felipe Massa was the only Williams driver to run, as Valtteri Bottas saved wet-weather-tyres. After <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, more rain fell and a number of drivers went out to get more running on the full-wet tyres.
