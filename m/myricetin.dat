5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, <b>myricetin,</b> quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
25|$|In red grapes, {{the main}} {{flavonol}} is on average quercetin, followed by <b>myricetin,</b> kaempferol, laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main flavonol is quercetin, followed by kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols <b>myricetin,</b> laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, {{indicating that the}} enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myricetin,</b> laricitrin and syringetin, flavonols {{which are}} present in red grape {{varieties}} only, {{can be found in}} red wine.|$|E
25|$|Extracts of {{ginkgo leaves}} contain {{phenolic}} acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as <b>myricetin,</b> kaempferol, isorhamnetin and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones, ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, {{as well as}} alkylphenols and polyprenols.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} from muscadine grapes may contain more than 40mg/L, an exceptional phenolic content. In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, <b>myricetin,</b> quercetin, kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics. Contrary to previous results, ellagic acid and not resveratrol {{is the major}} phenolic in muscadine grapes.|$|E

Lebreton in 1972) and suggests that the absence of a widely distributed compound like <b>myricetin</b> among the Nepenthes examined might provide [...] "additional diagnostic information for these six species".|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{green tea}} is 99.9% water, {{provides}} 1 Calorie per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table) and contains phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and caffeine. Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which have antioxidant, anticarcinogen, anti-inflammatory, and anti-radiation biochemical effects in vitro. [...] Other components include {{three kinds of}} flavonoids, known as kaempferol, quercetin, and <b>myricetin.</b> A remarkably higher content of <b>myricetin</b> is detected in tea and its extracts than in many other plants, and this high concentration of <b>myricetin</b> may have some implications for the experimentally-observed bioactivity of tea and its extracts in vitro.|$|E
2500|$|The Leguminosae {{are rarely}} cyanogenic, however, where they are, the cyanogenic {{compounds}} {{are derived from}} tyrosine, phenylalanine or leucine. They frequently contain alkaloids. Proanthocyanidins can be present either as cyanidin or delphinidine or {{both at the same}} time. [...] Flavonoids such as kaempferol, quercitin and <b>myricetin</b> are often present. Ellagic acid has never been found in any of the genera or species analysed. [...] Sugars are transported within the plants in the form of sucrose. C3 photosynthesis has been found {{in a wide variety of}} genera. The family has also evolved a unique chemistry. Many legumes contain toxic and indigestible substances which may be removed through various processing methods. Pterocarpans are a class of molecules (derivatives of isoflavonoids) found only in the Fabaceae.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, <b>myricetin,</b> morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> {{can act as}} a pro-oxidant {{compound}} when it {{interacts with}} DNA. Studies involving in vitro models have shown that <b>myricetin</b> causes the degradation of DNA. Additionally, <b>myricetin,</b> in the presence of Fe3+ and Cu2+, intensified this DNA degradation. The antioxidants catalase, superoxide dismutase, mannitol, and sodium azide in combination with Cu2+ increased the DNA degradation activity of <b>myricetin.</b> <b>Myricetin</b> was shown to create reactive oxygen species that caused the DNA damage.|$|E
50|$|The lignans nymphaeoside A and icariside E, and the flavonols {{kaempferol}} 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (afzelin), quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (quercitrin), <b>myricetin</b> 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (myricitrin), quercetin 3-O-(6'-O-acetyl)-beta-d-galactopyranoside, <b>myricetin</b> 3-O-beta-d-galactopyranoside and <b>myricetin</b> 3-O-(6'-O-acetyl)-beta-d-galactopyranoside can {{be found}} in N. odorata.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>myricetin,</b> depending on its concentration, displays different oxidizing effects on DNA. Polyphenols like <b>myricetin</b> are able to reduce (donate electrons to) Fe3+. Thus, this reaction yields a less oxidized (more reduced) form of the iron cation: Fe2+ and a less reduced (more oxidized) form of <b>myricetin.</b> This allows <b>myricetin</b> to form a complex with oxygen and biochemically target the DNA molecule. At higher and higher concentrations of <b>myricetin,</b> the rate of DNA damage {{has been shown to}} decrease. A current hypothesis for why this occurs can be attributed to myricetin’s ability to chelate iron (Fe) (<b>myricetin</b> ligand forms two or more coordinate bonds to iron). These in vitro studies cannot be correlated directly to human models and should not be extrapolated.|$|E
50|$|Laricitrin {{is formed}} from <b>myricetin</b> by {{the action of}} the enzyme <b>myricetin</b> O-methyltransferase. It is further {{methylated}} by laricitrin 5'-O-methyltransferase into syringetin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> is also {{effective}} in protecting cells from carcinogenic mutation. <b>Myricetin</b> {{reduces the risk}} of skin tumorigenicity that is caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo(a)pyrene, a highly carcinogenic compound. <b>Myricetin</b> provided protection against the formation of skin tumors in mice models after tumor initiating and tumor promoter agents were applied to the skin. On a more biochemical level, it was shown that topical application of <b>myricetin</b> to mice inhibited the binding of benzo(a)pyrenes to DNA and protein native to epidermal skin cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> also impacts the {{biochemical}} {{efficacy and}} binding ability of large intracelluar biomolecules. <b>Myricetin</b> {{has been shown}} to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase, cellular DNA polymerase, and cellular RNA polymerase. Inhibition of cellular DNA polymerases could have dangerous effects on the cell’s ability to replicate its genome and its progression through the cell cycle. Inhibition of cellular RNA polymerase could have deleterious effects on the cell’s capacity to transcribe and translate DNA and RNA to produce vital proteins for the cell. Researchers have found that <b>myricetin</b> has the ability to interfere in the RNA polymerase pathway in two different ways. In E. coli <b>myricetin</b> competitively inhibited GTP substrate binding to RNA polymerase. In T7 bacteriophages <b>myricetin</b> competitively inhibited DNA template binding to RNA polymerase.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been shown that <b>myricetin</b> is {{effective}} in protecting neurons against oxidative stressors. Researchers have shown that PC12 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidative stressor experience cell death due to apoptosis. When treated with <b>myricetin,</b> these oxidatively stressed cells displayed statistically significant increased cell survival.It has been suggested that <b>myricetin</b> not only has oxygen radical scavenging abilities, but also inherent, specific cell-survival capacities. Other molecules known for oxygen radical scavenging (vitamin E and boldine) did not successfully protect the cell models from oxidative stress and eventual cell death as effectively as <b>myricetin</b> and other biochemically related molecules.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> {{was found}} to be absent from all studied taxa. This agrees with the {{findings}} of previous authors and suggests that the absence of a widely distributed compound like <b>myricetin</b> among the Nepenthes examined might provide additional diagnostic information for these taxa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> is {{a member}} of the {{flavonoid}} class of polyphenolic compounds, with antioxidant properties. It is commonly derived from vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries, tea, and is also found in red wine. <b>Myricetin</b> is structurally similar to fisetin, luteolin, and quercetin and is reported to have many of the same functions as these other members of the flavonol class of flavonoids. Reported average intake of <b>myricetin</b> per day varies depending on diet, but has been shown in the Netherlands to average 23 mg/day.|$|E

50|$|It {{has also}} been shown that <b>myricetin</b> can itself act as an agent of mutagenicity. <b>Myricetin</b> can produce {{frameshift}} mutations in the genomes of particular strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In general, biochemical structural studies have shown that flavonoid structures can tautomerize in biological systems to become active mutagens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> {{also has}} been shown to inhibit the act of genetic {{mutation}} as exhibited by the Ames test. This test showed that <b>myricetin</b> was more effective in preventing mutagenesis initiated by certain carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, and dibenzo(a,i)pyrene) as compared to others in which it was less effective in preventing against mutagenesis (benzo(a)pyrene 4, 5-oxide and the bay-region diol-epoxides of benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, and benzo(c)phenathrene). This data shows that <b>myricetin</b> is not unilaterally able to reduce the carcinogenic activity of all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or even the more specific subclass of benzo(a)pyrenes. It is to be noted that myricetin’s exact biochemical activity is still not fully understood. Clearly there is a multifaceted, complex system involved in the anticarcinogenic activity displayed by <b>myricetin</b> that does not apply equally to all carcinogens of the same subfamily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myricetin</b> {{has been}} seen to {{demonstrate}} antiviral activity against a number of viruses including Moloney murine leukemia virus, Rauscher murine leukemia virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus. Its effects against the proliferation of viruses {{is thought to be}} a consequence of myricetin’s ability to inhibit the proper functioning of reverse transcriptase. <b>Myricetin</b> was identified as a competitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase of Rauscher murine leukemia virus and a partial competitor with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus. Investigations into the activity of the HIV-1 strain when introduced to <b>myricetin</b> suggest the antiviral effects are derived from the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, however, there are suspicions that the inhibition is non-specific. Structural analysis of <b>myricetin</b> and other flavonoids with observed antiviral effects indicate that the 3,4’ free hydroxyl groups likely are responsible for inhibition.|$|E

50|$|Polyphenols such as <b>myricetin</b> {{may prevent}} {{oxidative}} stress-induced platelet activation/aggregation. Thus, consumption of antioxidants may serve an anti-thrombotic function. In addition to offering protection by neutralizing peroxide radicals and effecting thromboxane production via the PTGS1 pathway, polyphenols such as <b>myricetin</b> may target other platelet activation pathways, limiting fibrinogen’s ability to bind platelet surface receptors.|$|E

50|$|Antioxidants are {{molecules}} {{present in}} {{fruits and vegetables}} that have been demonstrated to protect against some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Biomolecules and cell structures can experience oxidative stress due to the presence and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS like •OH, •O2−, and H2O2 are produced during cellular metabolism processes (aerobic respiration). ROS can damage lipids, DNA, and proteins. Gradual but steady accretion of such damage {{can lead to the}} development of many diseases and conditions including thrombosis, diabetes, persistent inflammation, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Flavonoids including <b>myricetin</b> are able to scavenge for ROS and can chelate intracellular transition metal ions that ultimately produce ROS. <b>Myricetin</b> also enhances the effects of other antioxidants. <b>Myricetin</b> can induce the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST has been suggested to protect cells against oxidative stress by protecting cells against free-radicals. In vitro studies have shown that <b>myricetin</b> significantly increased GST activity.|$|E
50|$|Antioxidants, {{including}} flavonoids such as <b>myricetin,</b> {{are often}} touted {{to reduce the}} risk of atherosclerosis, the hardening of arteries associated with high cholesterol. However, in vivo studies are lacking and in vitro studies are contradictory and do not support this claim. This claim is based on myricetin's proposed ability to increase LDL uptake by macrophages, which in theory would protect against atherosclerosis. This theoretical action of <b>myricetin</b> is not supported by experimental data. It is also proposed that <b>myricetin</b> may have the ability as a potent flavonoid antioxidant to prevent LDL oxidation, thus slowing the body's local inflammatory response and delaying the appearance of the first fatty streak and onset of atherosclerosis. Although mechanisms relating to <b>myricetin</b> specifically have not been proven, a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, and therefore rich in antioxidants, correlates with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis.|$|E

50|$|Several {{in vitro}} and animal studies have {{indicated}} the antidiabetic capabilities of myricetin; however, the evidence in clinical trials is less convincing. The flavonoid has been demonstrated to have a hypoglycemic effect by increasing the ability of adipocytes, as well as cells of the soleus muscle and liver of rats, to uptake glucose. This insulinomimetic effect is hypothesized to be a consequence of myricetin's either direct or indirect interaction with GLUT4, however, no analysis has produced concrete conclusions detailing exactly from where this effect is derived. In the hepatocytes of rats suffering from diabetes, <b>myricetin</b> has been observed to increase the activity of glycogen synthase 1. In trials done on Xenopus laevis oocytes, <b>myricetin</b> is thought to regulate the transport of glucose and fructose through the function of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in sugar absorption. In addition, daily injections of <b>myricetin</b> into rats has been seen to be correlated with increased sensitivity to insulin, indicating {{the possibility of using}} a <b>myricetin</b> as treatment or protection against insulin resistance, a frequent cause of diabetes mellitus. In the mouse myoblast cell line known as C2C12, treatment with <b>myricetin</b> not only increased glucose uptake, but also enhanced lipogenesis, a result not seen from any of the other bioflavonoids tested.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>myricetin</b> also has the potential to act as a pro-oxidant due to its tendency to undergo autoxidation depending upon its environment [...] It has been seen that when in the presence of cyanide, autoxidation is favored, resulting in superoxide, a byproduct characteristic of causing cellular damage [...] However, sodium azide, superoxide dismutase, and catalase have been seen to inhibit the autoxidation of <b>myricetin.</b>|$|E
