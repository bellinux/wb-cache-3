These experiments, reported in Reference 1, were directed toward determining bounding values for the minimum critical mass, <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>volume,</b> and maximum safe pipe size of water-moderated solutions of {sup 233 }U. Additional information on the critical experiments {{was found in the}} experimental logbooks. Two experiments utilizing uranyl nitrate (UO{sub 2 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }) solutions in simple geometry are evaluated in this report. Experiment 37 is in a 10. 4 -inch diameter sphere, and Experiment 39 is in a 10 -inch diameter cylinder. The {sup 233 }U concentration ranges from 49 to 62 g {sup 233 }U/l. Both experiments were reflected by at least 6 inches of water in all directions. Paraffin-reflected uranyl nitrate experiments, also reported in Reference 1, are evaluated elsewhere. Experiments with smaller paraffin reflected 5 -, 6 -, and 7. 5 -inch diameter cylinders are evaluated in U 233 -SOL-THERM- 004. Experiments with paraffin reflected 8 -, 8. 5 -, 9 -, 10 -, and 12 -inch diameter cylinders are evaluated in U 233 -SOL-THERM- 002. Later experiments with highly-enriched {sup 235 }U uranyl fluoride solution in the same 10. 4 -inch diameter sphere are reported in HEU-SOL-THERM- 010.

40|$|Possibilities {{to account}} for the {{mechanism}} of freeze-thaw injury to isolated protoplasts of Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Winter Bloomsdale were investigated. A freeze-thaw cycle to − 3. 9 C resulted in 80 % lysis of the protoplasts. At − 3. 9 C, protoplasts are exposed to the equivalent of a 2. 1 osmolal solution. Isolated protoplasts behave as ideal osmometers in the range of concentrations tested (0. 35 to 2. 75 osmolal), arguing against a <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> as a mechanism of injury. Average protoplast volume after a freeze-thaw cycle was not greatly different than the volume before freezing, arguing against an irreversible influx of solutes while frozen. A wide variety of sugars and sugar alcohols, none of which was freely permeant, were capable of protecting against injury which occurred when protoplasts were frozen in salt solutions. The extent of injury was also dependent upon the type of monovalent ions present, with Li = Na > K = Rb = Cs and Cl ≥ Br > I, in order of decreasing protoplast survival. Osmotic conditions encountered during a freeze-thaw cycle were established at room temperature by exposing protoplasts to high salt concentrations and then diluting the osmoticum. Injury occurred only after dilution of the osmoticum and was correlated with the expansion of the plasma membrane. Injury observed in frozen-thawed protoplasts was correlated with the increase in surface area the plasma membrane should have undergone during thawing, supporting the contention that contraction of the plasma membrane during freezing and its expansion during thawing are two interacting lesions which cause protoplast lysis during a freezethaw cycle...|$|E

The novel aspect of this work was in terms of composite processing, in particular, the use of fibre mats produced using a dynamic sheet former (DSF) wherein discontinuous treated fibres were aligned. Composites with different fibre weight contents were assessed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile testing. It was found that the fibres had a reasonable degree of alignment parallel to the DSF rotation direction together with good fibre dispersion. Tensile strengths of harakeke and hemp composites up to 101. 6 MPa and to 87. 3 MPa were achieved, approximately 90 and 60 % higher respectively than PLA (53. 9 MPa).

40|$|Although the {{question}} of <b>minimum</b> or <b>critical</b> fiber <b>volume</b> fraction beyond which a composite can then be strengthened due to addition of fibers has been dealt with by several investigators for both continuous and short fiber composites, a study of maximum or optimal fiber volume fraction at which the composite reaches its highest strength has not been reported yet. The present analysis has investigated this issue for short fiber case based on the well-known shear lag (the elastic stress transfer) theory as the first step. Using the relationships obtained, the minimum spacing between fibers is determined upon which the maximum fiber volume fraction can be calculated, depending on the fiber packing forms within the composites. The effects {{on the value of}} this maximum fiber volume fraction due to such factors as fiber and matrix properties, fiber aspect ratio and fiber packing forms are discussed. Furthermore, combined with the previous analysis on the minimum fiber volume fraction, this maximum fiber volume fraction can be used to examine the property compatibility of fiber and matrix in forming a composite.

Irrigation is {{to aid the}} establishment of 100 % grass coter {{within a few weeks}} to mitigate soil erosion problems. It is based on water sourced from a temporary excavated pond plus the use of a solar powered pump and a drip irrigation system. Railway batter erosion remediation is timed for the wet summer season when irrigation can be used to supplement natural rainfall.

A fit to the calculated <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass data using the extended criticality parameter {{is the basis of}} the revised method. The solution density (grams/ liter) for the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass is also obtained by a fit to calculated values. Input to the calculation consists of the Maxwellian averaged fission and absorption cross sections and the thermal values of nubar. The revised method gives more accurate values than the original method does for both the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass and the solution densities. The OB- 1 method has been extended to calculate the uncertainties in the <b>minimum</b> <b>critical</b> mass for 12 different fissile nuclides. The uncertainties for the fission and capture cross sections and the estimated nubar uncertainties are used to determine the uncertainties in the mini-mum critical mass, either in percent or grams.

40|$|Abstract Using {{conductive}} nanocomposites for bipolar {{plates in}} fuel cells can improve their performance. Percolation is the mechanism for nanocomposite conductivity. When the volume fraction of fillers in a composite material reaches a critical value, percolation starts to happen. If the composite material has an infinitesize, {{the probability of}} conductivity jumps from zero to 100 % at the <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> fraction. However, for finite-size composites, the probability would rise in a Gaussian-error-like smooth curve function. This research uses Monte Carlo simulations to study the percolation probability of finite-size nanocomposites cubes. The analyses show {{that there are two}} <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> fractions. As the cube size approaches infinity, the two <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> rates converge and should be equal to the theoretical value. Using the normal-cumulated-distribution function model, a power-law equation is obtained to estimate the <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> fraction from the corresponding nanocomposite cube size. However, the Monte-Carlo simulations in this research have been based on a uniform distribution of nanotubes in the composite cube. In practical implementation, the CVF obtained from this research can be treated as the lower bound of possible real values...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{explain the}} complete sequence of shapes of deflated spherical shells. Decreasing the volume, the shell remains spherical initially, then undergoes the classical buckling instability, where an axisymmetric dimple appears, and, finally, loses its axisymmetry by wrinkles developing {{in the vicinity}} of the dimple edge in a secondary buckling transition. We describe the first axisymmetric buckling transition by numerical integration of the complete set of shape equations and an approximate analytic model due to Pogorelov. In the buckled shape, both approaches exhibit a locally compressive hoop stress in a region where experiments and simulations show the development of polygonal wrinkles, along the dimple edge. In a simplified model based on the stability equations of shallow shells, a critical value for the compressive hoop stress is derived, for which the compressed circumferential fibres will buckle out of their circular shape in order to release the compression. By applying this wrinkling criterion to the solutions of the axisymmetric models, we can calculate the <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> for the secondary buckling transition. Using the Pogorelov approach, we also obtain an analytical expression for the <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> at the secondary buckling transition: The <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> difference scales linearly with the bending stiffness, whereas the <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> reduction at the classical axisymmetric buckling transition scales with the square root of the bending stiffness.
