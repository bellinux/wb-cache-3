40|$|Methods for {{determining}} self and mutual inductances, ordinarily used, are either null or throw methods, {{and have a}} limited degree of sensitivity and accuracy. If the throw method be converted to one of steady deflection by repeated unidirectional discharges at a constant rate, the errors arising from galvanometer damping and the difficulty in determining the galvano¬meter period with accuracy ate eliminated. A rotating commutator may be employed both to make and break the current at a constant rate {{and to have the}} galvanometer circuit closed only at make or at break of current, so that discharges through it are in the same direction. The rotating commutator described by the author* has been employed for this purpose, and it has been possible to evaluate inductances less than a <b>millihenry</b> with an error of about one per cent. The method is simple and accurate {{for a wide range of}} values of inductance. The arrangement and procedure are described below. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and {{analyses}} a microcontroller-based interface circuit for inductive sensors with a variable self-inductance. Besides the microcontroller (mu C) and the sensor, the circuit just requires an external resistor and a reference inductor so that two RL circuits are formed. The mu C appropriately excites such RL circuits {{in order to}} measure the discharging time of the voltage across each inductor (i. e. sensing and reference) and then it uses such discharging times to estimate the sensor inductance. Experimental tests using different commercial mu Cs at different clock frequencies show the limitations (especially, due to parasitic resistances and quantisation) and the performance of the proposed circuit when measuring inductances in the <b>millihenry</b> range. A non-linearity error lower than 0. 3 % full-scale span (FSS) and a resolution of 10 bits are achieved, which are remarkable values considering the simplicity of the circuit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Low Cost Control for {{a compact}} High-Power High-Speed Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) Machine has been {{developed}} in this research. The machine under consideration {{has been designed to}} run in the generation {{as well as in the}} motoring mode for utilization in vast industrial and automotive applications. When used as a motor for automotive applications, the machine is directly coupled to a radial inward flow compressor to operate as an electric driven supercharger running in the range of 40, 000 – 50, 00 rpm. To run the machine as a motor at its rated speed and power, a suitable electric drive and controller has to be utilized while considering the machine performance characteristics. Most of the available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems are either designed for low-speed high-power machines or high-speed, low-power machines. In addition, the self inductance of such machines are relatively high (in the range of hundreds of <b>millihenry)</b> compared to the AFPM machine under consideration which has a very low self inductance (in the range of tens of microhenry). The low inductance of PM machines often makes current control difficult. If high switching frequencies are not used, the current ripple in the machine windings will be very high, causing degradation of the overall machine efficiency and increasing the rotor torque ripple and pulsation. In this research a high frequency inverter-based controllers using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) is utilized to overcome the problem of the low inductance o...|$|E

50|$|A modern form of choke {{used for}} {{eliminating}} digital RF noise from lines is the ferrite bead, a cylindrical or torus-shaped core of ferrite slipped over a wire. These are often seen on computer cables. A typical RF choke value could be 2 <b>millihenries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Measured in <b>millihenries</b> (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding inductor core, increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|R
