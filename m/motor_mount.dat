25|$|The Firefly {{was created}} by {{replacing}} the engine of the S-300C light helicopter, {{which has been in}} use for nearly half a century, during which time more than 3,000 have been built. The S-300C's Lycoming 190-horsepower, 5.9-liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine was replaced with an electric motor, new <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> and two battery packs located {{on each side of the}} pilot. The rotor control, transmission and other systems were left essentially unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. [...] Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the motor mounting bolts. [...] Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. [...] Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. [...] If it does vary, then the standard Singer V belts can be too long or too short. [...] In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|E
50|$|The Sesquiwing {{featured}} a quick change <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> {{to accommodate a}} Curtiss C-6 or Curtiss OX-5 engine, and wheel fairings for speed.|$|E
5000|$|Given a motor {{with mass}} [...] {{attached}} via <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to the ground, the motor vibrates as it operates {{and the soft}} <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> act as a parallel spring and damper, [...] and [...] The force on the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> is [...] In {{order to reduce the}} maximum force on the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> as the <b>motor</b> operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, , is connected to [...] by a spring and a damper, [...] and [...] [...] is the effective force on the motor due to its operation.|$|R

5000|$|PN racing {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{aftermarket}} supplier to design an [...] "H-plate" [...] that allows the MR01 <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> to be installed on an MR02 chassis. They called it the MR one and a half, or MR1.5. This allows all the previous bodies to mount on the MR02 chassis.|$|E
50|$|Next, Kyosho {{produced}} the MR015, a narrow chassis with batteries stacked 2 {{up like the}} MR01, but with a servo saver and front suspension that is same as the MR02. The MR015 used a rear <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> similar to MR01, which allows all the previous bodies to be mounted to the MR015.|$|E

50|$|The Sonex plans contain several {{construction}} options, including conventional or tricycle landing gear, {{as well as}} {{a center}} or dual stick. <b>Motor</b> <b>mount</b> drawings are supplied for all three recommended powerplants: the 2180cc Volkswagen, 2200 Jabiru, and 3300 Jabiru. High performance is achieved through a clean aerodynamic shape and simple, light weight construction.|$|E
5000|$|TT-01E (Enhanced) - The {{standard}} TT-01 model upgraded with polycarbonate suspension uprights and fibreglass-reinforced nylon upper deck/chassis bracing and <b>motor</b> <b>mount,</b> thus improving {{both the}} structural rigidity and the toughness of the vehicle. For {{more information on}} the updated parts check this information from tamiya: TT01 vs. TT01 E By Andrew Kuntze ...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{boats were}} 12' and 13' (“Fisherman”) models and 15' (“Vandal”) models. Wacanda boats were all built with fiberglass ribs, stringers and floors. The only wood (other than some interior parts) {{used in the}} boats were wooden <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> beds. The boats {{were known to be}} extremely well built, with generous fiberglass lamination schedules.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the 2009 i-MiEV has a single permanent magnet synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear axle with a power output of 47kW and torque output 180N•m.|$|R
50|$|Also {{introduced}} in 2010 was the FunJET Ultra. The original FunJET {{is a popular}} subject for modification, with heavily modified examples capable of greater than 130 MPH (210 km/h). The Ultra addresses the problems inherent in such modifications {{with a combination of}} denser Elapor, improved aerodynamics with the elimination of the simulated wing tanks and an updated <b>motor</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
50|$|Following BMW's typical {{construction}} techniques at the time, {{the motor}} incorporates a cast-iron block and aluminium head. Weight-saving measures include aluminium chain cases, oil sump, <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> arms, accessory mounts and a cartridge-style oil filter housing. Closely {{related to the}} SOHC M40, the M42's DOHC 16 valve head and chain-driven cams provided increased power {{in comparison to the}} M40.|$|E
50|$|The Coronado 25 has {{a generous}} fixed keel, broad beam to length ratio, and shipped with {{spinnaker}} rigging. The outboard <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> is enclosed on 4 sides, shielding the engine from fast back swells during rough weather. The tiller is {{long enough to}} allow a seated skipper to adjust the jib sheets while controlling the tiller.|$|E
50|$|Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were {{replaced}} by hydraulic systems and electric motor-driven systems. Most systems today are driven by an electric <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> at each tower.|$|R
50|$|Estes {{discontinued}} the NCR line of {{rockets and}} other products in 2000. Since the brand has been discontinued, most people modify the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts</b> to use industry-standard 29 mm size motors.|$|R
50|$|The Porcupine used “Jam-pot” shocks and Teledraulic race forks. The E90 model had an open frame. The E95, {{introduced}} in 1953, had a loop type frame with the <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> lower.|$|R
50|$|The Firefly {{was created}} by {{replacing}} the engine of the S-300C light helicopter, {{which has been in}} use for nearly half a century, during which time more than 3,000 have been built.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is a braced {{parasol wing}} monoplane with all-wood construction. The exception being the <b>motor</b> <b>mount,</b> struts and landing gear are {{made out of}} steel. It was designed to use an engine from an Aeronca aircraft. Spruce {{was used as the}} structural material with birch plywood covering. The spars are from an Aeronca K. The controls are modified from a Piper Cub. The aircraft does not have brakes or a tailwheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{registered in the}} experimental category and several {{attempts were made to}} register it in the restricted category for aerial photography. New owner Clifford Bryant flew the aircraft from Fresno, California until a partial <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> failure caused the engine to nearly fall off in flight. The {{aircraft was}} sold to Madonna Inn partner Arthur Madonna, and was later destroyed in 1941 when a shed collapsed on it in a storm.|$|E
5000|$|The Vélosolex has a [...] <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> {{above the}} front wheel. Power is {{delivered}} via a small ceramic roller that rotates {{directly on the}} front wheel by friction to the tire.|$|R
2500|$|... {{power may}} be {{transferred}} to a wheel from a <b>motor</b> <b>mounted</b> directly above, by bringing a powered roller or rubber belt {{into contact with the}} tire. These are called [...] "friction drives".|$|R

5000|$|Bertier's car {{accident}} took place AFTER the Championship game, on December 11, 1971. Bertier {{had been at}} a banquet honoring the players of the 1971, T.C. Williams Titans football team for their undefeated season. After the banquet, Bertier borrowed his mother's new 1971 Chevrolet Camaro. Bertier {{lost control of the}} Camaro and crashed. (The movie shows him getting broadsided). The cause of the accident was determined to be a mechanical failure in the <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> of the engine.|$|E
50|$|For the 1974 model year, the A {{engine was}} modified, and all {{subsequent}} A engines {{use the new}} block style. Since there was increasing need for accessories like air conditioning, anti-pollution air pumps and the like, the distributor was moved from the front side of the engine {{to the middle of}} the block to make room for these accessories. Additionally, the <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> positions were moved slightly. Nissan introduced its emission control technology, called NAPS (Nissan NAPS) with the redesign.|$|E
50|$|The Nissan A engine {{design is}} a refined, quiet and durable {{gasoline}} engine. It {{appears to be}} a modern replacement of the earlier iron-headed Nissan E engine and is of similar dimensions. The 1960s E series was an all-new design from newly acquired Aichi Kokuki, and integrated Nissan's improvements to the BMC A-Series engine design in the 1950s (Nissan was a licensee of Austin Motor Company technology). As production continued, 1974 and newer A-series engines have different block castings, with relocated <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> bosses.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the Saturn Vue Green Line BAS Hybrid system {{that uses a}} smaller electric <b>motor</b> (<b>mounted</b> {{to the side of}} the engine) and battery pack than the Honda IMA, but functions similarly.|$|R

40|$|Vibration modes {{associated}} with a fan impeller, <b>motor,</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> assembly in small air-conditioning units can be excited by motor torque pulsations in single-phase motors. Experimental procedures were developed {{that can be used}} to measure the torsional resonance frequencies of the stationary parts (motor stator and <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> assembly) and the rotating parts (fan impeller and motor rotor and shaft assembly) of a propeller fan assembly. Impact test procedures, test procedures in which the fan motor is set up to act as a torsional shaker, and procedures that employ the use of a microphone in an anechoic room are presented in this paper...|$|R
