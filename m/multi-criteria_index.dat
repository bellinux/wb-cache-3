40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{generate}} an easy to use index to evaluate the ecological state of agricultural land from a sustainability perspective. We selected environmental indicators, such as the use of organic soil amendments (green manure) versus chemical fertilizers, plant biodiversity (including crop associations), variables which characterize soil conservation of conventional agricultural systems, pesticide use, method and frequency of tillage. We monitored the ecological state of 52 agricultural plots to test the performance of the index. The variables were hierarchically aggregated with simple mathematical algorithms, if-then rules, and rule-based fuzzy models, yielding the final <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>index</b> with values from 0 (worst) to 1 (best conditions). We validated the model through independent evaluation by experts, and we obtained a linear regression with an r 2  =  0. 61 (p =  2. 4 e- 06, d. f.  =  49) between index output and the experts' evaluation...|$|E

The combination of digital camera and computer technologies have allowed to provide new services like visualising quickly snapshots on a computer {{with the possibility of}} direct snapshot touch up or printing. Lately the apparition of a new type of memory proposes the extension of capacities of camera storage to a few thousands of photos. Otherwise home devices like Set-Top-Boxes associated with TV and mobile devices like mobile phone and PDA offer various possibilities of connection and can execute dynamically loaded programs. In this paper, we present the new concept of digital album which is a photo album stored on the camera's memory with <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>indexing</b> methods to make efficient snapshots retrieval. We also propose a new architecture around the numeric camera that permits to widen the specter of services proposed. Finally this article gives details about our prototype built in our laboratory to validate the architecture and to estimate the code size...|$|R
30|$|The {{compromise}} ranking method, {{which is}} also known as VIKOR, is an effective technique with more than one criterion set for decision making. The acronym is derived from “Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje.” The <b>multi-criteria</b> ranking <b>index</b> is developed {{on the basis of the}} measurements of proximity to the ideal solution (usually in the form of distance). This technique was introduced by Opricovic in 2004 to optimize the evaluation dynamic and complicated processes through compromising. The technique uses linear normalization; however, the values are not dependent on just criterion evaluation. VIKOR also uses an aggregate function to balance the distance between both the ideal solution and its opposite. This helps the decision maker choose from a set of conflicting solutions (Alabool and Mahmood 2013; Whaiduzzaman et al. 2014; San Cristóbal 2011).|$|R
40|$|The VIKOR {{method was}} {{developed}} for multicriteria optimization of complex systems. It determines the compromise ranking list and the compromise solution obtained with the given weights. This method focuses on ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives {{in the presence of}} conflicting criteria. Here, the VIKOR method is used for two times t and t+ 1. In order to calculate the progress or regression via Malmquist productivity index, the positive and negative ideals at times t and t+ 1 are calculated first. Then we introduce the <b>multi-criteria</b> ranking <b>index</b> based on the particular measure of “closeness” to the ideal solution and calculate the separation of each alternative from the ideal solution at times t and t+ 1. Then we use the Malmquist productivity index to calculate the progress or regression of all alternatives. In this paper, productivity of alternatives available in decision matrix with interval numbers and their improvement or deterioration is researched. To achieve this practical goal, use of extended VIKOR is made to calculate Malmquist productivity index for multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with interval numbers, and by applying Malmquist productivity index, productivity rate of growth for alternatives is calculated. Finally, a numerical example illustrates and clarifies the main results developed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the impact of taxation on long-term economic growth with special emphasis on corporate taxation using alternative indicator of tax burden which is called World Tax Index (WTI). The WTI was constructed by authors using hard data as well as soft data expressing qualified expert opinion gained from a questionnaire survey conducted among tax specialist from OECD countries. It is a <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>index</b> consisting of several sub-indices that deal with different groups of taxes, which are basically consistent with the classification according to the OECD. All the parts are used in further regression analysis to approximate the tax burden in growth model. As an alternative, also the tax quota is used, being the most applied indicator of tax burden. Results show that tax quota is not suitable for tax burden approximation, especially in case of corporate taxes or VAT. Corporate tax burden negatively influence long-term economic growth, as suggested by economic theory. Web of Science 60676374...|$|E
40|$|Endemic {{arthropods}} {{were used}} to evaluate the conservation value of the 16 Natural Forest Reserves (NFRs) of the Azores (Macaronesia). For each of the 280 known Azorean endemic species of arthropods, a rarity index was calculated, using distribution and abundance data obtained from the literature. In addition, several scoring indices {{were used to}} rank the 16 NFRs. Frequency distributions of the rarity index indicated that there was a tendency for a greater proportion of the commonest species being represented in the NFRs in contrast with a lower representation of the rarest species. About 60 % of the endemic arthropod species that were recorded from the NFRs are ‘single NFR endemics’, that is, are known from only one of the 16 NFRs. Species richness was considered {{to be a very good}} surrogate measure of the conservation value of the 16 NFRs under study. The fact that the six highest ranked NFRs (using a composite <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>index)</b> are located in different islands has some important conservation management implications; to preserve a large proportion of the Azorean arthropod biodiversity there is a need to protect sites in all islands. If the five highest ranked NFRs are correctly managed in terms of conservation, then at least 80 % of the endemic arthropods known from the NFRs could be protected. Most of the tested taxa (Acari-Oribatei; Lepidoptera; Diptera; Coleoptera) are good surrogates of the overall total set of species present in the 16 NFRs when using a species richness index...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{introduces}} a <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>index</b> to assess flood hazard areas in a regional scale. Accordingly, a Flood Hazard Index (FHI) {{has been defined}} and a spatial analysis in a GIS environment has been applied for the estimation of its value. The developed methodology processes information of seven parameters namely flow accumulation, distance from the drainage network, elevation, land use, rainfall intensity and geology. The initials of these criteria gave the name to the developed method: “FIGUSED”. The relative importance of each parameter for the occurrence and severity of flood has been connected to weight values. These values are calculated following an “Analytical Hierarchy Process”, a method originally developed for the solution of Operational Research problems. According to their weight values, information of the different parameters is superimposed, resulting to flood hazard mapping. The accuracy of the method has been supported by a sensitivity analysis that examines a range for the weights' values and corresponding to alternative scenarios. The presented methodology {{has been applied to}} an area in north-eastern Greece, where recurring flood events have appeared. Initially FIGUSED method resulted to a Flood Hazard Index (FHI) and a corresponding flood map. A sensitivity analysis on the parameters' values revealed some interesting information on the relative importance of each criterion, presented and commented in the Discussion section. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis concluded to a revised index FHIS (methodology named FIGUSED-S) and flood mapping, supporting the robustness of FIGUSED methodology.

In the last years, much {{research has been}} devoted to tackle poverty fuzziness, while less {{attention has been paid to}} poverty complexity. In this paper, we employ Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Analysis to provide a structural representation of poverty, in terms of the pattern of implications existing among different poverty descriptors related to specific scenarios. We show how fuzzy relation theory and partially ordered set techniques are effective in representing complex relational structures and provide new insights into multidimensional poverty.

40|$|The Second Songhua River is {{the biggest}} river system in Jilin Province, China. In recent years, the rapid {{economic}} development in this area has increased the prominence of water resources and water-related environmental problems; these include surface water pollution and the overexploitation of groundwater resources. Bank infiltration on the floodplains of the Second Songhua River is an important process of groundwater-surface water exchange under exploitation conditions. Understanding this process can help {{in the development of}} water resource management plans and strategies for the region. In this research, a <b>multi-criteria</b> evaluation <b>index</b> system was developed with which to evaluate the suitability of bank filtration along the Second Songhua River. The system was comprised of main suitability indexes for water quantity, water quality, the interaction intensity between surface water and groundwater, and the exploitation condition of groundwater resources. The index system was integrated into GIS (Geographic Information System) to complete the evaluation of the various indicators. According to the weighted sum of each index, the suitability of river bank filtration (RBF) in the study area was divided into five grades. Although the evaluation index system and evaluation method are applicable only to the Second Songhua River basin, the underlying principle and techniques it embodies can be applied elsewhere. For future generalization of the evaluation index system, the specific evaluation index and its scoring criteria should be modified appropriately based on local conditions...|$|R
40|$|Use-oriented {{benefits}} and treatment cost analysis have {{been incorporated into}} a water quality index to derive economically optimized pollutant concentrations {{for use in the}} development of waste water treatment programs. This <b>multi-criteria</b> water quality <b>index</b> can be used in decision-making at federal and local governmental levels. Five major pollutants (coliforms, nitrogen, phosphorus, suspended solids, and detergent) were considered in the treatment of municipal wastewater. With each higher level of improvement, the treatment costs increase proportionally, but the benefits associated with the reuse of this treated wastewater also increase in all cases except that of nutrient removal for agricultural use. Listed in descending order of their general utility, possible uses of reclaimed water include water supply, recreation, irrigation, industrial use, waste disposal, transportation, and commercial fishery. The optimal concentration of a pollutant was defined as that point at which the marginal costs of its removal equal the marginal benefits thereby obtained. The optimum net benefits associated with each kind of reclamation are derived simultaneously. The multicriteria water quality index is a combination of the maximum net {{benefits and}} the water quality index of the optimal individual concentrations. Walski and Parker's water quality index was used in rating water quality. This methodology was applied to the Tucson region for the expediency of acquiring data. Possible uses considered for the reclaimed municipal wastewater included agricultural irrigation and recreational lakes in the Tucson metropolitan area. Results from this study indicate that the <b>multi-criteria</b> water quality <b>index</b> is zero dollars, or (NB = $ 1. 83 • 10 ⁶, WQI = 0). Similar evaluations for other cities, made in the same way, would permit ranking of this index. This ranking would be useful for making decisions concerning the allocation of regional funds for treating municipal wastewater. This approach could also be used on a local level for determining optimal concentrations of pollutants and for optimal allocation of the treated water...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} assess the {{environmental}} impact of chemical plant protection on the environment in an intensive crop production. This was conducted in a large-scale farm, located in the Wielkopolska voivodeship (Poland), in the years 2010 - 2013. The greatest number of chemical plant protection treatments were carried out for root crops and the lowest number for annual fodder crops (approximately 4 and 2 treatments, respectively). On average, there were carried out 3 chemical protection treatments for one plant species. The largest quantities of active substances were used in protection of root crops (5. 72 kg*ha- 1), followed by annual fodder crops (2. 97 kg*ha- 1), and smaller ones in oilseed crops (2. 63 kg*ha- 1) and cereals (2. 44 kg*ha- 1). The average consumption of active substances was 2. 68 kg*ha- 1. The most consumed were herbicides and fungicides. The average value of the <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>index</b> of the impact of plant protection on the environment amounted to - 63. 9 points. The lowest value of the index, indicating the most negative impact, was found for protection of root crops (- 135. 3 points), followed by annual fodder crops (- 100 points). While the highest index value, resulting from smaller use of toxic substances, had oilseed crops (- 54 points) and cereals (- 62. 4 points). The environmental impact of chemical plant protection was mainly related to a high risk of volatilisation into the atmosphere, followed by leakage into groundwater and a risk of surface water contamination. The threat of bioaccumulation of substances in living organisms was smaller...|$|E

In this respect there are number of definitions which are describing specific aspect of sustainability notion. The management system is complex system and requires adequate tool to measure sustainability as the complexity property of management system. The lecture will enlight the historical background of the sustainability development and emphasizes its importance for the management system validation. The complexity of sustainability notion is characterized by multi-dimensional structure including indicators of different scale. The application of sustainability development to the management system requires respective methodology and procedure. The complexity of management system is defined as structure of elements which are comprising individual functionality within the management system. Each element is described with number of indicators The methodology is based on multi-criteria evaluation of the system. With the agglomeration of indicators of elements of management system the Sustainability Index is derived which introduce the quality measure of the management system.

40|$|Groundwater is {{the major}} source of {{drinking}} water in the study area., High fluoride content above permissible limit (> 1. 5 mg/l) are recorded at many places in groundwater samples of study area resulting in health hazards, causing dental and skeletal fluorosis. The major litho-units of study area are limestone, shales and Deccan traps. Integrated quality <b>indices,</b> <b>multi-criteria</b> decision making and sensitivity function analyses are used to analyze the groundwater samples using mathematical modelling. The geochemistry of groundwater relating major ionic constituents with fluoride using statistical analysis are carried out to understand the source and mechanism of enrichment of fluoride in groundwater. Based on multi-criteria decision making approach, the majority of the samples fall under the category of decreased quality region. Results of sensitivity function analyses indicate, waters belong to less recommended range. Saturation indices of fluoride minerals are interpreted using Chadha’s diagram. The geochemical analysis indicates the alkalis, viz., Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + indicated negative correlation with fluoride. This could be due to the oversaturation of carbonate minerals as inferred from saturation indices. Positive correlation between Fwith that of Na+ ions and pH is observed, which {{may be due to the}} rock dissolution processes. From the above studies it is interpreted that the mineral dissolution through rock water interaction {{is the major}} controlling process of fluoride enrichment in groundwater.

Despite progress in developing the vulnerability studies, {{there is more to}} investigate regarding the quantitative approach and clarification of the conceptual explanation of the social component. At the same time, some disaster-prone areas register limited attention. Among these, Romania's capital city, Bucharest, is the most earthquake-prone capital in Europe and the tenth in the world. The location is used to assess two multi-criteria methods for aggregating complex indicators: the social vulnerability index (SoVI model) and the spatial <b>multi-criteria</b> social vulnerability <b>index</b> (SEVI model). Using the data of the 2002 census we reduce the indicators through a factor analytical approach to create the indices and examine if they bear any resemblance to the known vulnerability of Bucharest city through an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). This is a critical issue that may provide better understanding of the social vulnerability in the city and appropriate information for authorities and stakeholders to consider in their decision making. The study emphasizes that social vulnerability is an urban process that increased in a post-communist Bucharest, raising the concern that the population at risk lacks the capacity to cope with disasters. The assessment of the indices indicates a significant and similar clustering pattern of the census administrative units, with an overlap between the clustering areas affected by high social vulnerability.
