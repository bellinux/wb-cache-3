25|$|The {{change in}} the numbers has {{happened}} due to the prevalence of homelessness in local communities rather than other changes. According to HUD's July 2010 Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, more than 1.59 million people spent at least one night in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2010 reporting period, this is a 2.2 percent increase from 2009. Most users of homeless shelters used only emergency shelter, while 17 percent used only transitional housing and less than 5 percent used both during the reporting period. Since 2007 the annual number of those using homeless shelters in cities has decreased from 1.22 million to 1.02 million. That is a 17 percent decrease. The number of those using homeless shelters in suburban and rural areas has increased 57 percent from 367,000 to 576,000 In the USA, the federal government's HUD agency has required federally funded organizations to use a computer tracking system for homeless people and their statistics, called HMIS (Homeless <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System).</b> There has been some opposition {{to this kind of}} tracking by privacy advocacy groups, such as EPIC.|$|E

40|$|Hospitals {{are using}} more {{sophisticated}} and comprehensive <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to implement multiple strategic policies towards water cost saving and water quality enhancement. However, they do not always achieve the intended strategic goals. This paper analyzes how managerial styles interact with sophisticated <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve different water strategic priorities. How proactive vs. reactive managerial styles moderate the effects of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> on water cost saving and water quality enhancement is analyzed. Relationships are explored using data collected from 122 general services directors in Spanish public hospitals. The findings show a positive effect of sophisticated <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> on the achievement of water policies focused on cost saving and quality enhancement. Results also show a different moderated effect of managerial styles; thus, sophisticated <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> with a proactive managerial style facilitate managers to achieve better water quality policies rather than water cost saving policies...|$|R

2500|$|Wang {{wanted to}} compete against IBM as a {{computer}} company, selling directly to <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> departments. Before the VS, however, Wang Laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company. The calculators, word processing systems and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang's book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as [...] "a beachhead in the Fortune 1000." [...] The Wang VS was Wang's entrée into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, [...] "we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, and who knew their way around Fortune 1000 companies." [...] As the VS took hold, the word processor and OIS lines were phased out. The word processing software continued, {{in the form of}} a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server.|$|E

[...] "If they ever make a movie of the Inslaw suit," [...] he writes, [...] "it could be called Mrs. and Mrs. Smith Go to Washington and Meet Franz Kafka." [...] Inslaw's founder, William A. Hamilton, in a {{previous}} position with the U.S. Justice Department, had helped develop a program called PROMIS, short for Prosecutor's <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System.</b> PROMIS was designed to organize the paperwork generated by law enforcement and the courts. After he left the Justice Dept, Hamilton alleged {{that the government had}} stolen PROMIS and had distributed it illegally, robbing him of millions of dollars. The department denied this, insisting that they owned it because Hamilton had developed it while working for them. As a result of this dispute, Hamilton and the department had been in litigation since 1983. A federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the department had indeed taken the software by [...] "trickery, fraud, and deceit," [...] a decision upheld by a federal district court in 1988, but overturned on appeal in 1991.|$|E

This research used two dimensions. The first dimension is computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and the second dimension the Development of Performance. The control sample was (063). (360) questioners were distributed and (306) were retrieved back with a percentage of (85 %). Several statistical tools were used for data analysis and hypotheses testing, including reliability correlation using Cronbach’s alpha, “ANOVA”, Simple Linear Regression and Step Wise Regression. The overall findings of the current study suggested the presence of a statistically significant relationship between resources (physical, software, and human and organizational) for the computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and the development of performance in the Electricity Distribution Company in Gaza. The study recommended the following: The need to strengthen the company's management interest in the potential of computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and using them in the computerization of all the company's activities. And the need to involve workers and users in the design of computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and assessment and development process. And strengthen the relationship between users and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> personnel in the department responsible for the system. And it is essential that the company is developing the infrastructure for information technology in general, and computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> in particular for the development of performance. And increase interest in providing resources (physical, software, and human and organizational) for the computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> The current study is unique by the virtue of its nature, scope and way of implied investigation, as it is the first study at Electricity Distribution Company in Gaza resources explores the status of Computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> {{and their relationship to}} the development of performance in the Electricity Distribution Company in Gaza increasing interest in Computerized <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> through continuity, keeping pace with technological means and modern techniques...|$|R

Another {{purpose of this}} study was to determine which of the related disciplines of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are used most in the theses. In addition, as a result of the study, the compatibility degree between the theses written and the courses taught in the graduate programs of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> were determined. In this research, content analysis method is used. Through this method, each of the theses was evaluated with a 10 -question ‘thesis evaluation question set' constructed towards the purpose of the study. Through this evaluation, the current situation of the field was determined. It was observed that the number of doctoral theses associated with the field was less. Using the combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques most in the theses denoted that the interdisciplinary approaches were adopted in the theses associated with <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> It was observed that the literature analysis and survey techniques were the most studied research methods in the theses. Besides, statistical techniques were used highly in the theses. As a result of this study, it was concluded that out of the associated disciplines of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>management</b> science, computer science and statistics disciplines were more associated with the investigated theses. When the study results were evaluated as a whole, it was seen that significant progress was made in the discipline of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> compared to the early 2000 s...|$|R
