5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> and {{challenging}} {{in the field of}} education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} {{by reducing the}} narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily the <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> thing now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011 Awake was honored, {{along with}} seven others, with the Critics' Choice Television Award for <b>Most</b> <b>Exciting</b> New Series, chosen by journalists {{who had seen}} the pilots.

ET Online reviewer Jarett Wieselman noted that Isaacs could snag an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination; however, Isaacs {{was not on the}} list of nominees announced July19, 2012. In 2013, Zap2it included the show on their list of 22 great one-season television shows.|$|E

5|$|Kinsler was a 2008 AL All Star at the 79th All Star Game at Yankee Stadium. It was his <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> {{moment in}} {{baseball}} to that point. He was a reserve voted in by his peers. In the fan balloting, Dustin Pedroia, who finished with nearly 1.3 million votes, beat him by 34,243 votes. In the game, Kinsler hit 1-for-5 {{and stole a}} base. He was called out attempting to steal another base, though replays demonstrated that the umpire had missed the call. The Washington Post and ESPN baseball writer Jayson Stark picked Kinsler as the AL MVP {{for the first half}} of the season.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 2009–10 season, Burrows left {{during a}} game against the Los Angeles Kings after being hit in the throat by a Jarret Stoll slapshot. He was not injured, however, and did not miss any games thereafter. Playing a full season on the Canucks' top line with the Sedins, he {{recorded}} a career-high 35 goals, 32 assists, 67 points and a +34 rating. His goals total ranked first on the Canucks. Fans voted him as recipient of the team's <b>Most</b> <b>Exciting</b> Player Award for the third consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|Returning from injury the {{following}} season, Bertuzzi {{emerged as one}} of the Canucks' best offensive contributors, finishing with 25 goals (second on the team to Markus Näslund) and 50 points in 1999–2000. At the end of the season, he received the team's <b>Most</b> <b>Exciting</b> Player Award, as voted by the fans. He received the distinction three more times during his career with the Canucks from 2002 to 2004). Meanwhile, the Canucks began improving as a team, finishing four points out of a playoff spot in the West in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Näslund {{emerged as}} an offensive leader with the Canucks. Injuries to forwards Alexander Mogilny and Todd Bertuzzi, {{as well as the}} absence of Pavel Bure, resulted in Näslund earning more ice time. He scored his third NHL career hat-trick on 5 December 1998 during a 4–1 win against the Dallas Stars. At mid-season, he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game, held in January 1999. He went on to record a team-leading 36goals and 66points, resulting in him being awarded the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as the Canucks' most valuable player—his first of five during his tenure with Vancouver— as well as his first of two of the team's annual <b>Most</b> <b>Exciting</b> Player Awards (he received his second two years later). In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Canucks to a three-year, $7.2million contract.|$|E

5|$|The 1930 season saw the Australians tour England, Bradman's first tour. Over five Tests, {{the young}} Australian scored 974 {{runs in a}} {{flawless}} batting display to break Hammond's record run aggregate and average set in the 1928–29 series. While Bradman dominated, Hammond found {{it very difficult to}} play the leg spin bowling of Clarrie Grimmett, who dismissed him five times. Hammond scored 306 runs at an average of 34.00, passing fifty just twice. He batted over five hours for a match-saving 113 in the third Test. On a difficult pitch and with little support, he made a hard-hitting 60 in the final Test in a losing cause. The visitors took the series 2–1, and the newspapers unfavourably compared Hammond's scoring with Bradman's. Later in the season, Hammond scored 89 for Gloucestershire in a tied match against the Australians which he described as the <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> of his career. One player said that he had never seen Hammond as excited as he was {{at the conclusion of the}} game. In all first-class cricket that season, he scored 2,032 runs (average 53.47) and for Gloucestershire, he came top of the batting averages as the club finished second in the Championship. He took 30 wickets, including match figures of 12 for 74 against Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
