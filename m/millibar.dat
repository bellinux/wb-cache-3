5|$|Steering {{currents}} above Alicia remained weak {{during the}} storm's lifetime. However, a ridge was well formed {{to the north}} of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one <b>millibar</b> an hour in the 40hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115mph (185km/h) in winds and 962millibars (28.39inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category3hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.|$|E

The report also discusses the standard setting for altimeters (known as the regional QFF) that had been introduced in May 1948 for aircraft above 1,500feet within control zones, and that any error in setting the barometric pressure of one <b>millibar</b> gave an error of 28feet.|$|E

The report stated there was {{reason to believe that the}} York's altimeters were set a lot higher than the Regional QFF. This may have been caused by using the wrong QFF sent earlier by the controller or that the altimeters were still set to the standard mean sea level barometric pressure.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} {{effects of}} a tropical cyclone will cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of low atmospheric pressure and fall in regions of high atmospheric pressure.
