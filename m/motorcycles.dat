40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeOver {{the past}} few years, <b>motorcycle</b> {{fatalities}} have increased {{at an alarming rate}} in the United States. <b>Motorcycle</b> safety issues in Kansas are no different from the national scenario. Accordingly, this study attempted to investigate <b>motorcycle</b> crashes in Kansas to identify critical characteristics and to evaluate the effect of those on <b>motorcycle</b> crash injury outcomes. State-level <b>motorcycle</b> rider fatality rates were investigated while considering various factors including helmet laws, using generalized least squares regression modeling. A detailed characteristic analysis was carried out for <b>motorcycle</b> crashes, using Kansas crash data. Comparisons were made between several aspects of <b>motorcycle</b> crashes and other vehicle crashes. Analysis using Logistic regression was performed on Kansas <b>motorcycle</b> crash data to identify factor affecting fatal <b>motorcycle</b> crashes. In addition, a survey was conducted focusing on identifying <b>motorcycle</b> rider behaviors, helmet usage patterns, perception towards helmet laws in Kansas, potential problems, crash contributory factors, and difficulty levels of different <b>motorcycle</b> maneuvers to execute. Ordered probit modeling was used to identity factors contributing to increased severity of Kansas <b>motorcycle</b> riders involved in crashes. Results from state-level modeling showed statistically significant relationships between <b>motorcycle</b> fatality rates in a given state as well as several other factors. These factors included weather-related conditions, helmet laws, per capita income, highway mileage of rural roads, population density, education, demographic distributions, and <b>motorcycle</b> registrations in the state. The study showed that states with mandatory helmet laws had 5. 6 % fewer <b>motorcycle</b> fatalities per 10, 000 registrations and 7. 85 % fewer <b>motorcycle</b> fatalities per 100, 000 populations. Characteristic analysis of <b>motorcycle</b> crashes in Kansas revealed that <b>motorcycle</b> maneuvers such as overtaking, motorcyclists being older than 40 years, using <b>motorcycle</b> helmets, using <b>motorcycle</b> helmets and eye protection simultaneously, daytime riding, crashes occurring on roadside shoulders, and influence of alcohol among the riders during crashes had higher risk of ending up as a fatal <b>motorcycle</b> crash in Kansas. Results from the survey conducted among <b>motorcycle</b> riders in Kansas revealed that 71 % of respondents thought drivers of other vehicles were the single biggest threat to their own safety. Survey results also revealed that 64 % of respondents opposed a mandatory law requiring <b>motorcycle</b> riders and passengers to wear helmets in Kansas. Result from the ordered probit modeling of <b>motorcycle</b> rider injury severity showed that overturned and fixed-object <b>motorcycle</b> crashes, helmet use, younger <b>motorcycle</b> riders, speeding, presence of alcohol among <b>motorcycle</b> riders, and good weather contributed to increased severity of injury of <b>motorcycle</b> riders involved in crashes in Kansas...|$|R
