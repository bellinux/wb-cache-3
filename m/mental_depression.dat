6000|$|For {{the next}} year--that {{is for the}} whole of 1910--Henry James was under the shadow of an illness, partly {{physical}} but mainly nervous, which deprived him of all power to work and caused him immeasurable suffering of mind. In spite of a constitution that in many ways was notably strong, the question of his health was always a matter of some concern to him, and he was by nature inclined to anticipate trouble; so that his temperament was not one that would easily react against a malady of which the chief burden was <b>mental</b> <b>depression</b> of the darkest kind. It would be impossible to exaggerate the distress that afflicted him for many months; but his determination to surmount it was unshaken and his recovery was largely a triumph of will. Fortunately he had the most sympathetic help at hand, over and above devoted medical care. Professor and Mrs. William James had planned to spend the summer in Europe again, and when they heard of his condition they hastened out to be with him as soon as possible. The company of his beloved brother and sister-in-law was {{the best in the world}} for him--indeed he could scarcely face any other; only with their support he felt able to cover the difficult stages of his progress. It was William James's health, once more, that had made Europe necessary for him; he was in fact much more gravely ill than his brother, but it was not until later in the summer that his state began to cause alarm. By that time Henry, after paying a visit with his sister-in-law to Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hunter at Epping, had joined him at Nauheim, in Germany, where a very anxious situation had to be met. While William James was losing ground, Henry was still suffering greatly, and the prospect of being separated from his family by their return to America was unendurable to him. It was decided that he should go with them, and they sailed before the end of August. They had just received the news of the death in America of their youngest brother, Robertson James, whose epitaph, memorial of an [...] "agitated and agitating life," [...] was afterwards written with grave tenderness in the [...] "Notes of a Son and Brother." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{these results}} of over-education, {{disastrous}} as they are, are perhaps less disastrous than the effects produced on the health--the undermined constitution, the enfeebled energies, the morbid feelings. Recent discoveries in physiology have shown how immense is {{the influence of}} the brain over the functions of the body. Digestion, circulation, and through these all other organic processes, are profoundly affected by cerebral excitement. Whoever has seen repeated, as we have, the experiment first performed by Weber, showing the consequence of irritating the vagus nerve, which connects the brain with the viscera--whoever has seen the action of the heart suddenly arrested by irritating this nerve; slowly recommencing when the irritation is suspended; and again arrested the moment it is renewed; will have a vivid conception of the depressing influence which an over-wrought brain exercises on the body. The effects thus physiologically explained, are indeed exemplified in ordinary experience. There is no one but has felt the palpitation accompanying hope, fear, anger, joy--no one but has observed how laboured becomes the action of the heart when these feelings are violent. And though there are many who have never suffered that extreme emotional excitement which is followed by arrest of the heart's action and fainting; yet every one knows these to be cause and effect. It is a familiar fact, too, that disturbance of the stomach results from mental excitement exceeding a certain intensity. Loss of appetite is a common consequence alike of very pleasurable and very painful states of mind. When the event producing a pleasurable or painful state of mind occurs shortly after a meal, it not unfrequently happens either that the stomach rejects what has been eaten, or digests it with great difficulty and under protest. And as every one who taxes his brain much can testify, even purely intellectual action will, when excessive, produce analogous effects. Now the relation between brain and body which is so manifest in these extreme cases, holds equally in ordinary, less-marked cases. Just as these violent but temporary cerebral excitements produce violent but temporary disturbances of the viscera; so do the less violent but chronic cerebral excitements produce less violent but chronic visceral disturbances. This is not simply an inference:--it is a truth to which every medical man can bear witness; and it is one to which a long and sad experience enables us to give personal testimony. Various degrees and forms of bodily derangement, often taking years of enforced idleness to set partially right, result from this prolonged over-exertion of mind. Sometimes the heart is chiefly affected: habitual palpitations; a pulse much enfeebled; and very generally a diminution in the number of beats from seventy-two to sixty, or even fewer. Sometimes the conspicuous disorder is of the stomach: a dyspepsia which makes life a burden, and is amenable to no remedy but time. In many cases both heart and stomach are implicated. Mostly the sleep is short and broken. And very generally there is more or less <b>mental</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty; {{and then}} with the waning months came an ever augmenting sense of the dignity of twenty-one. Heaven knows I had nothing to 'come into,' save the bare birthday, and yet I esteemed it as a great possession. I now and then paved the way to my state of dignity, by {{beginning}} a proposition with the casual words, 'say that a man of twenty-one,' or by the incidental assumption of a fact that could not sanely be disputed, as, 'for when a fellow comes to be a man of twenty-one.' I gave a party on the occasion. She was there. It is unnecessary to name Her, more particularly; She was older than I, and had pervaded every chink and crevice of my mind for three or four years. I had held volumes of Imaginary Conversations with her mother on the subject of our union, and I had written letters more in number than Horace Walpole's, to that discreet woman, soliciting her daughter's hand in marriage. I had never had the remotest intention of sending any of those letters; but to write them, and after a few days tear them up, had been a sublime occupation. Sometimes, I had begun 'Honoured Madam. I think that a lady gifted with those powers of observation which I know you to possess, and endowed with those womanly sympathies with the young and ardent which it were more than heresy to doubt, can scarcely have failed to discover that I love your adorable daughter, deeply, devotedly.' In less buoyant states of mind I had begun, 'Bear with me, Dear Madam, bear with a daring wretch who is about to make a surprising confession to you, wholly unanticipated by yourself, and which he beseeches you to commit to the flames as soon as you have become aware to what a towering height his mad ambition soars.' At other times--periods of profound <b>mental</b> <b>depression,</b> when She had gone out to balls where I was not--the draft took the affecting form of a paper to be left on my table after my departure to the confines of the globe. As thus: 'For Mrs. Onowenever, these lines when the hand that traces them shall be far away. I could not bear the daily torture of hopelessly loving the dear one whom I will not name. Broiling on the coast of Africa, or congealing on the shores of Greenland, I am far far better there than here.' (In this sentiment my cooler judgment perceives that the family of the beloved object would have most completely concurred.) 'If I ever emerge from obscurity, and my name is ever heralded by Fame, it will be for her dear sake. If I ever amass Gold, it will be to pour it at her feet. Should I on the other hand become the prey of Ravens--' I doubt if I ever quite made up my mind what was to be done in that affecting case; I tried 'then it is better so;' but not feeling convinced {{that it would be better}} so, I vacillated between leaving all else blank, which looked expressive and bleak, or winding up with 'Farewell!' ...|$|E

Aims: To conduct a preliminary evaluation whether ACT is feasible and effective when delivered by psychologists and non-psychologists for complex clients in a National Health Service (NHS) community mental health service for adults. Method: Staff were trained in ACT and conducted one-to-one therapy with clients. Measures on general <b>mental</b> health, <b>depression,</b> fusion and values were given pre-therapy post-therapy and at three month follow-up. Results: Standardised measures showed significant improvements post-therapy for global <b>mental</b> health, <b>depression,</b> cognitive fusion and values post-treatment. These were partially maintained at follow-up and remained after an intent-to-treat analysis. There were no differences in outcomes between psychologists and non-psychologists, Conclusions: ACT may be delivered effectively with limited training for complex cases in secondary care, though further research is needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} information landscape with respect to mental health, <b>mental</b> illness, and <b>depression</b> as it might be encountered by female Muslim immigrants in London Ontario. In the study, commonalities and differences were explored in the constructions of <b>mental</b> health and <b>depression</b> as they relate to the lives of Muslim immigrants from the perspectives of local Muslim religious leaders and in publications intended for the lay public that are produced by Canadian mental health organizations. Pamphlets concerning <b>mental</b> health and <b>depression,</b> intended for the lay public, were collected from several health and social service centres. As well, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight Muslim religious leaders about their understandings of <b>mental</b> health and <b>depression,</b> particularly as they relate to immigrants to Canada. A discourse analysis was conducted on each of the ‘texts’, the pamphlets and interview transcripts, using a pre-constructed template. Overall, the study indicates that while the pamphlets clearly reflect a primarily medicalized construction of <b>mental</b> illness and <b>depression,</b> the interviews with religious leaders conveyed a more multi-faceted understanding of these conditions. While recognizing the possible necessity for medical intervention to deal with mental health problems, the religious leaders emphasized the significance of overcoming social isolation, especially for those who are immigrants. In their construction of help or ‘treatment’ for individuals who are troubled by problems such as depression, the religious leaders emphasized the community’s responsibility, framing both the causes of and responses to mental illness within a religious discourse. The findings suggest that, as well as being a source of support to congregants, religious leaders can help {{to play the role of}} mediators, contextualizing information for mental health service providers when interacting with Muslim immigrants...|$|R
