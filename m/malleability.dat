5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} {{to make the}} presence or absence of <b>malleability</b> the principle of this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The <b>malleability</b> of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{lanthanum}} added to steel improves its <b>malleability,</b> resistance to impact, and ductility, whereas addition of lanthanum to molybdenum decreases its hardness {{and sensitivity to}} temperature variations.|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's <b>malleability</b> {{makes it easy to}} bend into the various shapes {{required}} and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, <b>malleability,</b> and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} <b>malleability,</b> led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. All metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its <b>malleability.</b> Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and <b>malleability</b> in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, <b>malleability,</b> and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the <b>malleability</b> of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor <b>malleability)</b> than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|While {{these reforms}} succeeded in forming an {{equilibrium}} {{between the old}} common law courts and the new courts, they were viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. While the King's Bench was more revolutionary, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. The disparity between the reformist King's Bench and conservative Common Pleas was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited <b>malleability</b> while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its <b>malleability</b> and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the common}} law courts were {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than {{the common law}} courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the common law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of the common law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited <b>malleability</b> while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The major use for high-yield copper is in {{flashing}} products, where <b>malleability</b> {{and strength}} are both important.|$|E
25|$|The plasticity, or <b>malleability,</b> of the {{material}} during manufacture allows it to be cast, pressed, or extruded {{into a variety of}} shapes, such as: films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, amongst many others.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} {{thirty years after}} Money's initial report that the {{reassignment}} had been a success, Money's view of the <b>malleability</b> of gender became the dominant viewpoint among physicians and doctors, reassuring them that sexual reassignment was the correct decision in certain instances, resulting in thousands of sexual reassignments.|$|E
25|$|The {{installation}} of copper roofing is a craft requiring experienced installers. Its ductility and <b>malleability</b> {{make it a}} compatible material to form over irregular roof structures. It is easy to hammer or work into watertight designs without caulk or gaskets. Domes and other curved roof shapes are readily handled with copper.|$|E
25|$|Use as {{surgical}} {{and medical}} instruments {{as early as}} Ur, Hellenistic-era Egypt and Rome, and their use continued until largely replaced in Western countries {{in the mid to}} late 20th century by cheaper, disposable plastic items and sharper, more durable steel ones. Sterling's natural <b>malleability</b> is an obvious physical advantage, but it is also naturally aseptic.|$|E
25|$|Copper is an {{excellent}} material for flashing because of its <b>malleability,</b> strength, solderability, workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life. This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage.|$|E
25|$|Native {{elements}} {{are those that}} are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes native metals, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and <b>malleability,</b> and electrical conductivity. Native {{elements are}} subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.|$|E
25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its <b>malleability</b> {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E
25|$|The gold group, with a cubic {{close-packed}} structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum {{group is}} similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are kamacite and taenite, which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ {{by the amount of}} Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of native iron, whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic; for example, they lack the <b>malleability</b> of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.|$|E
25|$|During the Archaic Period, from 6000–1000 BC, mixed conifer-hardwood forests {{as well as}} mixed prairie-forests {{replaced}} Wisconsin's conifer forests. People {{continued to}} depend on hunting and gathering. Around 4000 BC they developed spear-throwers and copper tools such as axes, adzes, projectile points, knives, perforators, fishhooks and harpoons. Copper ornaments like beaded necklaces also appeared around 1500 BC. These people gathered copper ore at quarries on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan and on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. They may have crafted copper artifacts by hammering and folding the metal and also by heating it to increase its <b>malleability.</b> However it is not certain if these people reached the level of copper smelting. Regardless, the Copper Culture of the Great Lakes region reached a level of sophistication unprecedented in North America. The Late Archaic Period also saw the emergence of cemeteries and ritual burials, {{such as the one}} in Oconto.|$|E
25|$|He was vassal of the High-king of Beleriand, Thingol. Before {{the wars}} began {{he lived in}} Doriath. When Melian {{enclosed}} it with her magic Girdle of Melian to aid its defence he became uneasy and moved to Nan Elmoth outside the Girdle. One of the greatest Elven-smiths of Middle-earth, he forged Anglachel and Anguirel two great, black, magic swords. Made from a meteorite's metal, they can cut all earth-delved iron and have an entrapped sentience. His smithwork rivalled that of the greatest of the Elven-smiths, Fëanor and Celebrimbor, in both fame and fate. One sword, Anglachel, he gave to Thingol as tribute for living in Nan Elmoth and it was eventually used by Túrin to slay Glaurung the dragon. The other sword, Anguirel, he kept for himself. Eöl devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and <b>malleability,</b> which he fashioned into armour that he wore when he went abroad. He was friend of the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost and, until {{the founding of the}} realms of the Noldor, all the traffic of goods between the Sindar and Dwarves passed through Nan Elmoth.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its <b>malleability,</b> and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E
500|$|... {{between the}} extreme <b>malleability</b> {{of gold and}} the {{singular}} fragility of arsenic, other metals presented only imperceptible gradations of this character, and because there was probably no greater difference between the <b>malleability</b> of gold and that of lead, which {{was considered to be}} a metal, than there was between lead and zinc, which was classed among semi-metals, while in the substances intermediate between zinc and arsenic the differences were slight.|$|E
500|$|The Economist {{said that}} the Olympus scandal [...] "is not an {{accounting}} misdeed—it is a mindset. Olympus, and the response of Japanese officialdom, is less about a single sad incident {{as it is a}} view about the <b>malleability</b> of rules, and the subjectivity of their enforcement. Until Japan's institutions of governance—those internal to the corporations, as well external regulators and prosecutors—change, Japan cannot change." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{almost a}} year to the day later, on 8 December 1912, Battenberg assumed the post of First Sea Lord in {{succession}} to Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman. Military historian Hew Strachan contends that Battenberg [...] "lacked Fisher's dogmatism. Not the least of his attractions to Churchill [...] was his <b>malleability.</b> The combination of frequent change and weak appointees [...] ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war. Power now lay with the service's civilian head... Winston Churchill".|$|E
500|$|Silver {{production}} has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the Old Testament of the Bible, {{such as in}} Jeremiah's rebuke to Judah: [...] "The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them." [...] (Jeremiah 6:19–20) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the <b>malleability</b> and ductility of the metal: [...] "Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, {{the work of the}} workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men." [...] (Jeremiah 10:9) ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{the other}} platinum-family members were not {{discovered}} yet (platinum {{was the first}} in the list), Scheffer and Sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness—which is slightly more than for pure iron—platinum would be a relatively non-pliable material, even brittle at times, when in fact its ductility and <b>malleability</b> are close to that of gold. Their assumptions could not be avoided because the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of platinum-family elements such as osmium and iridium, amongst others, which embrittled the platinum alloy. Alloying this impure platinum residue called [...] "plyoxen" [...] with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound, but nowadays, very pure platinum is available and extremely long wires can be drawn from pure platinum, very easily, due to its crystalline structure, which {{is similar to that of}} many soft metals.|$|E
500|$|The density {{difference}} between lead (11.32g/cm3) and bismuth (9.78g/cm3) {{is small enough}} that for many ballistics and weighting applications, bismuth can substitute for lead. For example, it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers. It {{has been used as}} a replacement for lead in shot, bullets and less-lethal riot gun ammunition. The Netherlands, Denmark, England, [...] Wales, the US, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead (instead of small stones and grit) to aid digestion, or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting, such as in the Netherlands. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. (Another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is [...] "steel" [...] shot, which is actually soft iron.) Bismuth's lack of <b>malleability</b> does, however, make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets.|$|E
500|$|Nick De Semlyen of the UK film {{magazine}} Empire had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it [...] "a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles," [...] {{he said the}} villainous [...] "super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [...] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing." [...] Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book <b>malleability</b> in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here." [...] But, he asked, [...] "hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness." ...|$|E
500|$|During August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B {{tanks were}} {{captured}} by the Soviets near Sandomierz, and were soon moved to the testing grounds at Kubinka. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension {{of one of the}} tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 1015km. The 8.8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its [...] "colleague", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Analysis of the Tiger Ausf B armour plate showed an absence of molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), Some have said it gives the armour low <b>malleability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Induction forging {{refers to}} the use of an {{induction}} heater to pre-heat metals prior to deformation using a press or hammer. Typically metals are heated to between [...] to increase their <b>malleability</b> and aid flow in the forging die.|$|E

[...] The only substitution allowed {{is in the}} brand of shot {{and the size of}} the shot (#8, #9, etc. [...] Also, no substitutions are allowed in the shot material itself (whether it is lead shot, hevi-shot, steel shot, etc.), as the <b>malleability</b> of lead shot is noticeably different than steel.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In some {{locations}} any metal can, even aluminium, {{might be}} called a [...] "tin can". [...] Use of aluminium in cans began in 1957. Aluminium is less costly than tin-plated steel but offers the same resistance to corrosion in addition to greater <b>malleability,</b> resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminium, rather than laboriously constructed from three pieces of steel.|$|E
