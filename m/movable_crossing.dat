5000|$|As at Colton the {{workings}} at Timwood used [...] gauge hopper wagons underground, but the mine entrance {{was so close}} to the WSMR and so close to its level that wagons could be hand worked to a <b>movable</b> <b>crossing</b> over the WSMR line then tipped direct into wagons bound for the harbour, thereby avoiding multiple handling. Apart from small amounts discovered while pursuing their main target, this method of working remained an aspiration, because the Syndicate ran out of money in 1909, it had many costs and almost no income. It voted to be wound up on 24 March 1910 and its assets were auctioned off on 28 June that year, with Timwood's tunnel 1600 ft long [...] "but still well short of ore-bearing ground".|$|E
5000|$|Cross head - A <b>movable</b> <b>cross</b> head (crosshead) is {{controlled}} {{to move up}} or down. Usually this is at a constant speed: sometimes called a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine. Some machines can program the crosshead speed or conduct cyclical testing, testing at constant force, testing at constant deformation, etc. Electromechanical, servo-hydraulic, linear drive, and resonance drive are used.|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for positioning {{and holding}} material specimens {{is a major}} subsystem of a system for impact testing of the specimens at temperatures up to 1, 500 C. This apparatus {{and the rest of}} the system are designed especially for hot impact testing of advanced ceramics, composites, and coating materials. The apparatus includes a retaining fixture on a rotating stage on a vertically <b>movable</b> <b>cross</b> support driven by a linear actuator. These components are located below a furnace wherein the hot impact tests are performed (see Figure 1). In preparation for a test, a specimen is mounted on the retaining fixture, then the cross support is moved upward to raise the specimen, through an opening in the bottom of the furnace, to the test position inside the furnace. On one side of the furnace there is another, relatively small opening on a direct line to the specimen. Once the specimen has become heated to the test temperature, the test is performed by using an instrumented external pressurized-gas-driven gun to shoot a projectile through the side opening at the specimen...|$|R
50|$|The Court Street Bridge, {{also known}} as the Harold J. Dillard Memorial Bridge, is a {{vehicular}} <b>movable</b> bridge <b>crossing</b> the Hackensack River between Hackensack and Bogota in Bergen County, New Jersey, which owns it. Located 16.2 miles from the river mouth at Newark Bay, the swing bridge, which opened in 1908 and underwent major rehabilitation in 2010-2012, is the most-upstream bridge on the river required by federal regulations to open on request.|$|R
40|$|Near-field {{effects in}} Forward Scatter Radar (FSR) {{applications}} are analyzed, focusing the {{attention on the}} characterization of the received signal {{as a function of}} target/antenna distance and of target size. A simulated analysis of the forward-scatter cross-section (FS-CS) is carried out for a typical FSR scenario where a <b>movable</b> target <b>crosses</b> the baseline. In addition to the known far-field conditions, the results are presented also for the significant near-field Fresnel region, based on a suitable numerical evaluation of the diffraction integrals {{as a function of the}} geometrical and physical parameters involved. According to a basic modeling approach, the overall FS amplitude and phase signature of typical conductive targets have been evaluated in terms of their size and distance to the antennas. The above investigations allow not only for an accurate analysis of the forward scattering problem but also for a physical insight on the performance of the FSR in near-field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{crossing}} of rivers in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) by railway {{lines in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s gave Belgian engineers and contractors the opportunity to build record spans for railway bridges. The {{crossing of}} the Lualaba River at Bukama consists of four Vierendeel steel girders each with a 62 m span, which were the largest of their type {{at the time of}} their erection in 1925. The crossing of the Lualaba at Kongolo, built in 1937 – 1939, required a 495 m long reinforced concrete continuous beam bridge with 14 spans, the largest measuring 70 m. It was the first significant concrete beam bridge constructed with a travelling gantry supporting <b>movable</b> formwork. The <b>crossing</b> of the Lukaga River (1938 – 1939) is a three-span concrete bridge with the 70 m long central span built using the cantilever method, which makes this bridge the oldest of its type in the world. This paper highlights the landmark characteristic of these forgotten bridges. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
