The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the conceptions and misconceptions held by teachers about <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> and modeling in order to aid in the development of teacher education and professional development programs. The study used a mixed methods approach. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey of a large sample of practicing and prospective secondary teachers of mathematics in the United States. The purpose of this was to gain an understanding of the conceptions held by the general population of United States secondary mathematics teachers. In particular, basic concepts of <b>mathematical</b> <b>models,</b> <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling,</b> and <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> in education were analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained from case studies of a small group of mathematics teachers who had enrolled in professional development which had <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> or modeling as a focus. The purpose of these case studies was to give an illustrative view of teachers regarding modeling, as well as to gain some understanding of how participating in professional development affects teachers' conceptions. The data showed that US secondary mathematics teachers hold several misconceptions about models and modeling, particularly regarding aspects of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> process. Specifically, the majority of teachers do not understand that the <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> process always requires making choices and assumptions, and that <b>mathematical</b> <b>modeling</b> situations must come from real-world scenarios.
