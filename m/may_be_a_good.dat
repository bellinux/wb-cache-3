25|$|Scientists {{hypothesize that}} bird song has evolved through sexual selection, and {{experiments}} {{suggest that the}} quality of bird song <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of fitness. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate, which thereby act as reliable indicators of health. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species. The ability of male birds to hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} academic {{debate over the}} real chronology of the chapters of the Quran. Carole Hillenbrand holds that there are several remaining tasks for the Orientalist Quranic scholars: Few Quranic scholars have worked on the epigraphy of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem whose foundation inscription dates to 72/692 and the antique Quran recently discovered in the Yemen, the Sana'a manuscripts. The Carbon-14 tests applied to this Quran date its parchment to 645-690 AD with 95 percent accuracy. Their real age <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal younger, since C-14 estimates the time of growth of an organism, and the process from that to the final writing on the parchment involves an unknown amount of time, and parchments were also re-used often. Paleography has dated the San'a manuscripts to 690-750 AD.|$|E
25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, pump and treat <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It {{is more difficult to}} reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while she <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E

2500|$|In certain cases, {{exploiting}} {{a resource}} more <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing. Carol M. Rose, in an 1986 article, discussed {{the concept of}} the [...] "comedy of the commons", where the public property in question exhibits [...] "increasing returns to scale" [...] in usage (hence the phrase, [...] "the more the merrier"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the [...] "comedic" [...] characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.|$|E
2500|$|New {{studies found}} {{that the use of}} Scleral contact lens, a type of rigid gas {{permeable}} (RGP) lens, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> option for most patients with PMD. [...] Most of these lenses are in the range of 15.5mm to 18.0mm in diameter. [...] Regardless of the lens size, it is thought that the larger the RGP lens will in most cases be more comfortable then standard rigid corneal lenses, and at times more comfortable than soft lenses, regardless {{of the fact that it}} is a rigid lens. [...] The highlight to the scleral design and the correction of eye disorders such as pellucid marginal degeneration is that vision with these types of lenses is exceptional when fit correctly.|$|E

2500|$|Kangaroo care arguably {{offers the}} most {{benefits}} for pre-term and low-birth-weight infants, who experience more normalized temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, increased weight gain, and fewer hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, studies suggest that preterm infants who experience kangaroo care have improved cognitive development, decreased stress levels, reduced pain responses, normalized growth, and positive effects on motor development. Kangaroo care also helps to improve sleep patterns of infants, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> intervention for colic. Earlier discharge from hospital is also a possible outcome Finally, kangaroo care helps to promote frequent breastfeeding, and can enhance mother-infant bonding.

2500|$|By September 2010, {{international}} tensions {{relating to}} imbalances had further increased. Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega [...] declared that an [...] "international currency war" [...] has broken out, with countries competitively trying to devalue their currency {{so as to}} boost exports. Brazil {{has been one of}} the few major economies lacking a reserve currency to abstain from significant currency intervention, with the real rising by 25% against the dollar since January 2009. Some economists such as Barry Eichengreen have argued that competitive devaluation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing as the net result will effectively be equivalent to expansionary global monetary policy. Others such as Martin Wolf saw risks of tensions further escalating and advocated that coordinated action for addressing imbalances should be agreed on at the November G20 summit.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{hardening}} {{happens to}} all cases, even low-pressure handgun cases. The sudden {{increase in pressure}} upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the split section to be removed. [...] The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life. Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> choice.|$|E
