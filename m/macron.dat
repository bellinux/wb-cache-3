5|$|Bolton Wanderers had a {{long-established}} {{partnership with}} sporting goods firm Reebok, which {{was formed in}} the town. Between 1997 and 2009 this partnership encompassed shirt sponsorship, kit manufacture and stadium naming rights. The combined shirt sponsorship (1990–2009) and kit manufacture (1993–2012) deals covering 22 years represent the longest kit partnership in English football history. The stadium's naming rights were held by Reebok since its opening in 1997 and was due to run {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Bolton's kit manufacturer from the 2014–15 season changed to Italian sportswear brand <b>Macron</b> who also manufacture kits for clubs including Aston Villa, Lazio and Napoli. The stadium was also re-branded as the <b>Macron</b> Stadium from July 2014 in an agreement that will last for an initial four years.|$|E

5|$|Wigan Warriors {{moved to}} the stadium a month after it opened, once they had played their final home game of the 1999 regular season at Central Park, which had been the club's home since 1902. After their former ground was sold, the {{possibility}} of ground sharing with Bolton Wanderers F.C. at the Reebok Stadium (now <b>Macron</b> Stadium) was presented, but the new stadium in Wigan was chosen instead. Their first game there was a play-off match against Castleford Tigers, which they lost, on 19 September. The Warriors did not lose a competitive match at the stadium in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Andorra {{has been}} a co-principality since the signing of a paréage in 1278, when the count of Foix and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell agreed to share {{sovereignty}} over the landlocked country. After {{the title of the}} count of Foix had been passed to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to the count of Foix in regard to the paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again. The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives Sicília and President Emmanuel <b>Macron</b> of France.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the move from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the BWSA {{accepted}} the invitation from the football club to hold its monthly meetings at the new stadium.

In the year 2000, the Association expanded significantly when its invitation to affiliate was accepted by Bolton Wanderers supporters groups {{in other parts of}} Britain, and also by groups around the world. All of these foreign groups have come on board to become independent, but integral, parts of the official Bolton Wanderers supporters' family. Requests for affiliated status continue to be received regularly from other places around the world where Wanderers fans find themselves gather together.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Forster {{was awarded}} Norwich City Player of the Month. On 17 April 2010, Norwich secured {{promotion}} to the Championship with a hard-fought 1–0 win over Charlton Athletic, with Forster pulling off excellent saves to deny Nicky Bailey and Deon Burton. One week later, Norwich's 2–0 win over Gillingham saw them win the League One title. In {{recognition of his}} contribution to Norwich's success, Forster was named the club's Players' Player of the Year 2010 and second in the Supporters' Player of the Year award.

50|$|The use of <b>macrons</b> to {{indicate}} the long vowel in New Zealand Government legislation is inconsistent, with this act being one example of non-macron use. A version of the legislation which includes <b>macrons,</b> however, is offered by the commission.|$|R
50|$|In physics, <b>macrons</b> are {{microscopic}} (dust-sized) particles, accelerated to high speeds.

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} diacritical marks native to Greek itself or used to romanize its characters, {{linguists}} also regularly mark vowel length with <b>macrons</b> (...) marking long vowels and rounded breves (...) marking short vowels. Where these are romanized, {{it is common}} to mark the long vowels with <b>macrons</b> over the Latin letters and to leave the short vowels unmarked; such <b>macrons</b> should not be confused or conflated with those used by some systems to mark eta and omega as distinct from epsilon, iota, and omicron.|$|R
5|$|Singh turned {{professional}} as {{he signed}} a multi-year agreement with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions through IOS Sports and Entertainment. On 10 October 2015 Singh fought his first professional boxing match. He defeated his opponent Sonny Whiting by TKO. On 7 November, Singh knocked British boxer Dean Gillen in round 1 at the National Stadium in Dublin. In his third pro fight, Singh fought on the undercard of Lee-Saunders on December 19. Singh defeated Bulgarian Samet Hyuseinov via technical knockout. On 21 March 2016 Singh knocked out Hungary's Alexander Horvath in round 3 on the Flanagan-Matthews undercard. Singh defeated French boxer Matiouze Royer at the Copper Box Arena on April 30 via 5th-round TKO. The fight was halted due to Royer suffering a cut above his left eye. On 13 May, Singh fought at Bolton's <b>Macron</b> Stadium against Polish Andrej Soldra. Singh won via 3rd-round TKO, knocking down Soldra in round 5 to mark his 6th professional win in a row, all coming by way of knockout.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{introduced}} the Latin script, {{which was used}} to record {{a large body of}} Aztec prose, poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments, administrative documents, legal letters, etc. In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet. No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl, and no general consensus has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish, such as long vowels and the glottal stop. The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Horacio Carochi, building on the insights of another Jesuit, Antonio del Rincon. Carochi's orthography used two different diacritics: a <b>macron</b> to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo, and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels. This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of the Jesuit community.|$|E

500|$|... {{whether and}} how to {{represent}} vowel length, e.g. by double vowels or {{by the use of}} <b>macrons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Māori devised ways to mark vowel-length, {{sporadically}} at first. Occasional {{and inconsistent}} vowel-length markings occur in 19th-century manuscripts and newspapers written by Māori, including macron-like diacritics and the doubling of letters. Māori writer Hare Hongi (Henry Stowell) used <b>macrons</b> in his Maori-English Tutor and Vade Mecum of 1911, as does Sir Āpirana Ngata, inconsistently, in his Maori Grammar and Conversation (7th printing 1953). Once the Māori language {{started to be}} taught in universities in the 1960s, vowel-length marking was made systematic. At Auckland University, Professor Bruce Biggs (of Ngāti Maniapoto descent) promoted the use of double vowels (thus Maaori), and this became the standard at Auckland until Biggs died in 2000. The Māori Language Commission, {{set up by the}} Māori Language Act 1987 to act as the authority for Māori spelling and orthography, favours the use of <b>macrons,</b> which are now the established means of indicating long vowels. Occasionally, diaeresis are seen instead of <b>macrons</b> (e.g. Mäori) due to technical limitations producing letters with <b>macrons</b> on typewriters and older computers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Macrons</b> {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} {{ambiguity}} that would otherwise arise {{due to the lack of}} representation of vowel length.|$|R
