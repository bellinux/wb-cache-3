Throughout this period a concern against demutualisation was that the assets of a <b>mutual</b> <b>society</b> were built up by its members throughout its history, not just by current members, and that demutualisation was a betrayal of the community that the societies were created to serve. Northern Rock chose to address these concerns by founding the Northern Rock Foundation, which funded community-based projects. At its Stock Exchange flotation Northern Rock distributed shares to members with savings accounts and mortgage loans; the flotation share price was £4.51908.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the leading market social economy organisations in Spain since the Constitution of 1978. The first part concerns a study of co-operatives and workers societies; the second refers to <b>mutual</b> <b>societies.</b> An analysis of the institutional framework, this sector's quantitative evolution, the responses to changes in the business background and the social impact of their activities enable us to conclude that over the period studied these companies have very significantly reinforced their position in the market. At the same time, they have consolidated their institutional recognition and their social image. Nevertheless, this very positive result should not obscure certain structural problems limiting their potential for development. The fragmentation of the three sub-sectors examined and the differences in legal treatment in financial and tax matters affecting <b>mutual</b> <b>societies</b> are questions that have to be resolved over coming years, with the aim of improving the competitive position of these organisations. co-operatives, worker associations, <b>mutual</b> <b>societies,</b> market social economy. ...|$|R

40|$|According to a draft bill {{currently}} {{before the}} Italian Parliament, <b>mutual</b> aid <b>societies</b> {{should be considered}} as part of the Third Sector.

The paper discusses the opportunity to include <b>mutual</b> aid <b>societies</b> into a more broadly defined Third Sector, by investigating the activities that these organizations are actually carrying out, with particular reference to the organizations working in health and social care services. The authors compare the nature and purposes of <b>mutual</b> aid <b>societies</b> and with those of other Third Sector organizations, and discuss the potential benefit of including this particular category for advancing the Italian welfare system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the demutualisation of the British building societies, the trend during the 1990 s for these mutual financial institutions run {{on behalf of}} their members and without external shareholders to convert to public limited companies. Demutualisation resulted from cultural change within senior management in <b>mutual</b> <b>societies,</b> which undermined their support for the idea of mutual ownership. This cultural change was a consequence of the deeper integration of <b>mutual</b> <b>societies</b> into the retail financial services sector where a different business culture was dominant. Though government has ignored the wider social impact of demutualisation, it has in fact undermined their attempts to encourage more socially inclusive forms of delivery for personal financial services. The paper makes a case for recognition of the contribution of <b>mutual</b> building <b>societies</b> to the development of more socially responsible corporate strategies. The recent wave of demutualisations also highlights the need for mutuals to encourage greater membership involvement in the running of the organisation. ...|$|R
