House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We sat back and listened to everything, and it reminded us of this <b>mom-and-pop</b> <b>store</b> around our way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era Black America and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} changes in wholesaling and {{retailing}} in the 1980s. Japan's distribution system {{was becoming more}} efficient. Retail outlets and wholesale establishments both peaked in number in 1982 and then went down 5.4 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, in 1985. The main casualties were sole proprietorships, especially mom-and-pop stores and wholesale locations with fewer than ten employees. Almost 96,000 of the 1,036,000 mom-and-pop stores in operation in 1982 were out of business three years later. Government estimates for the late 1980s show additional consolidation in both wholesale and retail sectors including a continued sharp decline in <b>mom-and-pop</b> <b>store</b> operations. A further decline in mom-and-pop stores is expected {{as a result of}} the Large-Scale Retail Store Law of 1990, which greatly reduced the power of small retailers to block the establishment of large retail stores. Soaring land prices are another major cause of the decline of mom-and-pop stores, but an even more important reason is the growth of convenience and discount stores. Discount stores are not much bigger than the traditional small shops, but their distribution networks gives them a big pricing edge. As of 2005, large chains dominate nearly every market niche be it consumer electronics (notably Yodobashi Camera) or cookies (Aunt Stellas).|$|E

40|$|A omerolek from Palau {{was made}} {{possible}} by relatives and acquain-tances along the way. I would like to go home someday, but now it is my turn to help my children and others. ” A omerolek 1 (my trip) is part of a story told by Serek, 2 a sixty-three-year-old retired Palauan man from Ngaraard State who came to Honolulu about twenty-eight years ago. With a faraway look in his lively eyes, Serek tells of a journey filled with hard work and sacrifices made possible by a tapestry of helping hands— klaingeseu. When he left Palau, Serek had hopes of getting a higher edu-cation. His family helped him save enough money to buy a one-way ticket to Guam, where he lived with relatives until he saved enough money to move to Honolulu a year later. In Honolulu Serek relied on his older brother’s generosity until he found gainful employment with a plumbing company. The Chinese proprietor grew to trust and rely on him, eventu-ally offering him company housing in exchange for security duties in the evenings. He lives with his wife in the same house, although he retired from the company two years ago. I found him sitting amid boxes of soda pop framed by a couple of sto-ryboards in the background. Serek now operates the only Palauan <b>mom-and-pop</b> <b>store</b> in O‘ahu, which he opened when he retired. He has had to work hard to prove to himself and to those who helped him along the way that it was worth all their efforts. He now employs his wife’s two nephews, who recently arrived from Palau, thus perpetuating the cycle of klaingeseu. The primary {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the sociocultural processes that influence the success of Palauan migrants 3 in Hawai‘i.

30|$|Economic {{modernization}} and the penetration of international retail chains: a new consumption environment with {{economies of scale}} occasioned by the penetration of international retail chains, the conglomeration of stores in shopping malls, and the increased availability of consumer credits might naturally necessitate the formalization of transactions and employment procedures. Larger enterprises with comparative advantages benefit from rapid urbanization, economic modernization, and the automation of value chains to a disproportionately larger degree, and this transformation alters the mode of spending to the disadvantage of local, <b>mom-and-pop</b> <b>stores,</b> and enterprises. This effect is further amplified by financial liberalization and rapid banking sector growth which facilitates access to consumer credits and credit cards for various income groups in the population, rather than just the wealthy.

50|$|Opposition to {{the project}} {{centered}} on the inclusion of Walmart as an anchor tenant and the potential impacts of big box retail on smaller, <b>mom-and-pop</b> <b>stores</b> in historic business districts.

Still others were concerned that the shopping center's actual design was too suburban in nature and not suitable for an dense, urban environment. Support for the project focused on the construction and permanent jobs that the development would create, and the convenience {{of being able to}} shop inside city limits, when many city residents are forced to drive to the surrounding suburbs to shop at comparable stores. However, there had been a Walmart in Port Covington, located off Hanover Street south of downtown Baltimore, which was one of 269 stores that were closed nationwide in early 2016; and currently, main rival Target has two city locations, in Mondawmin Mall and Canton.|$|R
