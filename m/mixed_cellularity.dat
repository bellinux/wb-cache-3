40|$|Background: Histologic subtypes of {{classical}} Hodgkin lym-phoma [cHL; e. g., nodular sclerosis, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity,</b> not oth-erwise specified (NOS) ] are epidemiologically and prognostically distinctive. Therefore, unexplained, ongoing incidence rate declines for <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> and increases for NOS require examination. Methods: We analyzed detailed histology-specific Hodgkin lymphoma incidence rates in 1992 through 2011 U. S. SEER data (n 21, 372) and reviewed a regional subset of 2007 through 2011 NOS pathology reports for insight into diagnostic practices. Results: cHL rates were stable until 2007, then decreased for whites [annual percent change (APC) and 95 % confidence inter-val (CI), 3. 6 % (5. 6 % to 1. 5 %) ]. Nodular sclerosis rates declined after 2007 by 5. 9 % annually, with variation by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. In 1992 through 2011, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> rates declined [APC 4. 0 % (4. 7 % to 3. 3 %) ], whereas NOS rates rose [5. 3 % (4. 5 %– 6. 2 %) ] overall {{and in most}} patient groups. The 2007 – 2011 NOS age-specific rates were more similar tomixed cellularity rates for 1992 – 1996 than 2007 – 2011. Trends in combined rates were minimal, supporting increasing misclas-sification of <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity,</b> lymphocyte depletion, and specific nodular sclerosis subtypes as NOS. Eighty-eight of 165 reviewed NOS pathology reports addressed classification choice. Twenty (12. 1 %) justified the classification, 21 (12. 7 %) described insuf-ficient biopsy material, and coders missed specific subtype infor-mation for 27 (16. 4 %). Conclusion: Recent nodular sclerosis rate declines largely represent true incidence changes. Long-term rate decreases for <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> and other less common subtypes, and increases for NOS (comprising 30 % of cHL cases in 2011), likely reflect changes in diagnostic and/or classification practice. Impact: Diminishing histologic subtyping undermines future surveillance and epidemiologic study of Hodgkin lym-phoma. Guideline-based use of excisional biopsies and more coding quality control are warranted. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24 (10); 1474 – 88. 2015 AACR...|$|E

40|$|Differential cell counts {{were made}} on nine lymph nodes whose {{structure}} was replaced by diffuse Hodgkin's disease; two of these nodes had the classical histological appearance of the lymphocytic predominance subtype, four of the <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtype, {{and three of the}} lymphocytic depletion subtype. Our attempts to achieve valid sampling methods are recorded. The counts, in general, confirm the postulated histological basis of the Rye classification of the subtypes of the diffuse disease. The major discrepancy is that, contrary to the histological descriptions, our direct counts have shown that lymphocytes, are, in general, more numerous in the lymphocytic depletion than in the <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtypes. The cell counts also show that normal mononuclear cells (mainly fibroblasts and macrophage-type cells) are much more numerous in the <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtype than in the other forms of diffuse Hodgkin's disease; this feature has not been emphasised in the Rye classification.

40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{progress}} in molecular technologies has enabled {{the detection of}} several oncogenic viruses in various types of tumors. The pathogenesis of Hodgkin’s disease is suggested {{to have a strong}} association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, Hodgkin’s disease related to EBV shows a wide geographic variation in epidemiology. These variations among different populations suggest an interaction of environmental factors and a direct role of EBV infection. Therefore, we performed a comparative study on epidemiologic, histologic, and virologic features of Hodg-kin’s disease among those {{in the western part of}} Kenya and in Nagasaki, Japan. The age distribution of Hodgkin’s disease showed a distinct peak in the 0 – 9 -year-old age group in Kenya, and a higher and lower peak in the 60 – 69 -and 30 – 39 -year-old age groups, respectively, in Japan.

40|$|In {{persons with}} HIV/AIDS (PWHAs), Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) risk is increased. However, HL incidence in PWHAs has unexpectedly increased since {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) was introduced. We linked nationwide HIV/AIDS and cancer registry data from 1980 through 2002. Immunity {{was assessed by}} CD 4 T-lymphocyte counts at AIDS onset. Annual HL incidence rates were calculated for 4 through 27 months after AIDS onset. During 477 368 person years (py's) of follow-up in 317 428 persons with AIDS (PWAs), 173 HL cases occurred (36. 2 per 105 py's). Incidence was significantly higher in 1996 to 2002 than earlier. Incidence in PWAs with 150 to 199 CD 4 cells/μL was 53. 7 per 105 py's, whereas in PWAs with fewer than 50 CD 4 cells/μL, it was 20. 7 per 105 py's (Ptrend =. 002). For each HL subtype, incidence decreased with declining CD 4 counts, but nodular sclerosing decreased more precipitously than <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity,</b> thereby increasing the proportion of <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> HL seen in PWAs. We conclude that HL incidence is lower with severe immunosuppression than with moderate immunosuppression, and HAART-related improvements in CD 4 counts likely explain the increasing HL incidence in PWHAS observed since 1996. With more severe immunosuppression, nodular sclerosing HL becomes infrequent, explaining the higher proportion of <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> HL found in PWAs.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and {{its association with}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) varies significantly with age, sex, ethnicity and geographic location. This is the first report on epidemiological features of cHL patients from Northern regions of China. These features are compared to data from a previously published Dutch cHL population. Methodology/Principal Findings: 157 cHL patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2008 in the North of China were included after histopathological re-evaluation. The Dutch population-based cohort consisted of 515 cHL patients diagnosed between 1987 and 2000. EBV status was determined by in situ hybridization of EBV- encoded small RNAs. In the Chinese population, tumor cells of 39 % of the cHL patients were EBV+ and this {{was significantly associated with}} male sex, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtype and young age (, 20 y). The median age of the Chinese patients was 9 years younger than that of the Dutch patients (28 y vs. 37 y).

We analyzed miRNA expression in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and the influence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection on the miRNA expression profiles. The expression of 157 miRNAs in lymph nodes from 49 cHL patients and 10 reactive lymph nodes (RLNs) was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Hierarchic clustering revealed 3 well-defined groups: nodular sclerosis cHL, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> cHL, and RLNs.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{incidence}} of Hodgkin's disease (HD) in Korea and other Asian countries {{is much lower}} than in western countries and its association with the Epstein-Barr virus has not been well characterized. METHODS. We evaluated the clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical features of 87 patients with Hodgkin's disease and also analyzed patients for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) using in situ hybridization for EBV DNA, RNA, and latent membrane protein (LMP 1). RESULTS. There were 68 males and 19 females, {{with a mean age}} of 38 years. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> was the most prevalent subtype. Expression of EBV RNA (EBER:EBV-encoded RNA) was detected in 60 of 87 cases (69 %) : 1 of 1 (100 %) with lymphocyte predominance, nodular; 4 of 7 (57 %) with lymphocyte predominance, diffuse; 10 of 17 (59 %) with nodular sclerosis; 38 of 51 (75 %) with mixed cellularity; and 7 of 11 (64 %) with lymphocyte depletion. Positivity was higher in advanced clinical stages; 4 of 7 patients (57 %) with Stage I; 6 of 12 patients (50 %) with Stage II; 7 of 9 patients (75 %) with Stage III; and 5 of 5 patients (100 %) with Stage nr HD EBV DNA was detected in 9 of 25 cases tested (36 %). LMP 1 was seen in 39 of 87 cases (45 %). EBER and LMP 1 positivity were higher in children and older adults than in adults aged between 15 - 50 years. Immediate early mRNAs (BHLF:Bam H-fragment, lower strand frame) was seen in a single patient. CONCLUSIONS. HD in Korea showed a high {{incidence of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtype and a high prevalence of EBV. EBV was detected in all subtypes, including a case of nodular lymphocytic predominance, and in all age groups, and showed correlation with <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> subtype and higher clinical stage.

Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals adjusted for age, registry, race/ethnicity, Jewish upbringing, education, and childhood domicile. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a significantly increased risk of Hodgkin’s disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 3, 2. 9).

The authors employed an improved method of fixation (paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate), which sharply defined cell borders and revealed T-cell antigens on RS cells in 8 of 30 (27 %) cases of HD. Antigen-specific staining was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. RS cells expressed T 11 (8 / 8 cases), Leu- 3 or T 4 (4 / 8 cases), Leu- 4 or T 3 (3 / 8 cases), but not other T-cell specific antigens (Leu- 1, T 8, T 6, 3 A 1). RS cells were negative for leukocyte common antigen (LCA/T 200), in contrast to positive LCA/T 200 staining of RS-like cells in T-cell lymphomas. RS cells in all HD cases were positive for Ki- 1 and/or Leu-M 1 antigens. The percentage of RS cells expressing T-cell antigens was less than 20 % (2 cases), 20 - 50 % (3 cases), or greater than 50 % (3 cases). This percentage and the specific T-cell antigens expressed varied in tissues from different sites in each of 2 cases. Expression of T-cell antigens by RS cells was found in nodular sclerosis (6 of 20 cases) and <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> (2 of 5 cases) but not in lymphocyte predominance (2 cases), lymphocyte depletion (1 case), or unclassified types (2 cases).

We use pre-processing approaches on a down-scaled image to separate the image objects from the background. Then, we apply a supervised classification method to assign pixels to predefined classes. Our pre-processing method is able to separate the tissue content of images from the image background. We analyzed three immunohistologically defined groups, non-lymphoma and the two most common forms of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> type. We found that nodular sclerosis and non-lymphoma images exhibit different amounts of CD 30 stain, whereas <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> type exhibits a large variance and overlaps with the other groups. The results {{can be seen as a}} first step to computationally identify tumor regions in the images. This allows us to focus on these regions when performing computationally expensive tasks like object detection in the high-resolution image. Contact...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) shows a wide geographic variation {{with regard}} to age, gender, histological subtypes and their association with Epstein-Barr virus. The proportion of EBV positive cases appears higher in developing than in developed countries. EBV is a common infection in Pakistan due to poor socioeconomic conditions, but reports regarding HL subtypes have been rather selective. Our aims were to establish the relative frequencies of the five subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma, to determine their associations with Epstein-Barr virus, and finally to establish whether such association follows patterns seen in developing or developed countries. Among 100 cases, the male: female ratio was 4. 5 : 1, with an age range of 4 - 82 years and an average of 26. 6 years. Similar to the subtype distribution in developing countries, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> was the commonest 57 %, followed by nodular sclerosis 35 %, lymphocyte rich 6 % and nodular lymphocyte predominant 2 %. EBV-LMP 1 staining was demonstrated in 41 / 57 (71 %) of the <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> and the 19 / 35 (54. 2 %) of nodular sclerosis subtypes. All 6 cases of lymphocyte rich and 2 cases of nodular lymphocyte predominant were negative for EBV-LMP 1. Speculation about prognostic effects of EBV infection on the course of HL are tempting. Thus the EBV-positive HL could in the future prove to be an excellent candidate for targeted cellular immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the biology of Hodgkin lymphoma have led to a new classification. Hodgkin lymphoma is now recognized as a B-cell disorder of germinal center or post-germinal center origin. In the WHO classification, Hodgkin lym-phoma consists of two categories, namely, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma encompasses not only nodular sclerosis, <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity,</b> and lymphocyte depletion subtypes, but also lymphocyte-rich subtype, among which, nodular sclerosis stands out as a distinct entity. A borderline neoplasm with features intermediate between Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has also been recognized. (Korean J Med 2011; 81 : 543 - 553...|$|E
40|$|B cell non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} of the follicular subtype (grade 3 / 3) {{affecting the}} nasopharynx and breast, and containing foci of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, was diagnosed in a 56 year old white {{woman who was}} a longstanding heavy smoker. Four years before this she had developed stage 1 a <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> Hodgkin lymphoma affecting the right inguinal region, which was treated by irradiation and chemotherapy without recurrence. Review of the original Hodgkin lymphoma histology demonstrated a small focus of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This {{is thought to be}} the first recorded case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurring in a sequential discordant lymphoma. Its importance is discussed...|$|E

An increased percentage of 'null cells' {{was observed in}} three out of the five patients studied. The two other patients had increased percentage of T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes from spleen with HD had a decreased {{ability to respond to}} suboptimal concentrations of T cell mitogens. When these cells were fractionated in a discontinuous density gradient a subpopulation of cells, unable to respond to Con A, was recovered from the dense cell fractions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} gallium- 67 (67 Ga) uptake and histological subtypes of Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s disease (HD) in paediatric patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients (45 males and 13 females aged 9. 2 +/- 4 years, range 1. 5 - 17 years) with histologically diagnosed HD underwent pretherapy 67 Ga scanning on days 2, 5, 12 or 14 days after intravenous administration of 25 - 50 MBq (0. 7 - 1. 4 mCi) of 67 Ga citrate. The scans were evaluated both visually and quantitatively using the activity of 67 Ga in the liver as a reference. Clinical outcome of 11 patients with high diffuse 67 Ga skeletal uptake was {{compared with that of}} 17 patients showing normal distribution of 67 Ga in the skeleton. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, the 67 Ga scans were positive in 47 patients with 117 lesions. Visual analysis did not differentiate between the histological variants of HD. However, quantitative analysis of lesion-to-liver ratios showed significantly higher values of 67 Ga uptake in the <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> type than in the nodular sclerosis type (t = - 3. 7, p andlt; 0. 001). Patients with high skeletal uptake had a higher relapse rate (6 / 11) than those with normal skeletal uptake (3 / 17). CONCLUSION: The findings show that quantitative analysis of 67 Ga uptake can differentiate between the two main subtypes of HD (<b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> and nodular sclerosis). Further diffuse skeletal uptake of 67 Ga indicates a higher relapse rate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malignant {{lymphoma}} (ML) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cancers and is most prevalent in developed countries. The distribution of different subtypes of ML varies in the different geographical locations according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Aims and Objectives: The study was aimed to analyze different patterns of ML in Eastern India and to compare it with other geographical locations. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and fifty five patients of two large hospitals in Eastern India were included over a period of four years and were categorized according to WHO classification, using morphology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: There were 347 (76. 3 %) non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and 108 (23. 7 %) Hodgkin lymphomas (HL). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the most common of the NHL type (35. 2 %) followed by the follicular lymphoma (19. 3 %). B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was the least common type of NHL (1. 4 %). <b>Mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> (33. 3 %) and nodular sclerosis (26. 9 %) were the two most common type of HL. Childhood lymphoma comprised of 12. 5 % of all ML. T cell NHL and HL were the common lymphomas in this age group. Conclusion: Incidence of follicular lymphoma is lower compared to western studies and <b>mixed</b> <b>cellularity</b> is most common subtype of HL unlike nodular sclerosis subtype in western world. Burkitt′s type NHL though is the most common subtype of childhood ML in many studies but in our study T cell NHL is the most common type of childhood ML...|$|E
