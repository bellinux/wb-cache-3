5|$|The station's callsign, NBN, is {{an acronym}} for Newcastle Broadcasting New South Wales. NBN is the only {{regional}} station in mainland Australia to produce a one-hour news bulletin seven days a week. Since 2007, it has been owned by Nine's parent company Nine Entertainment Co. (formerly PBL Media), making it a sister station to its metropolitan counterparts. Prior to 1 July 2016, NBN operated as an independent regional station, and not {{as part of the}} <b>main</b> <b>network,</b> under the name NBN. When Nine switched regional affiliations outside Northern NSW and the Gold Coast, NBN started only using Nine branding.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for {{the determination of}} a dynamic hillslope instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) in concert with a variable saturation excess runoff production model using a grid-based digital elevation model (DEM). The total channel network responsible for routing the runoff produced on the catchment {{is divided into two}} parts: the <b>main</b> channel <b>network</b> and the hillslope channel network. The hillslope IUH, which routes water from the hillslopes to the <b>main</b> channel <b>network,</b> is essentially the solution of the linear advection-dispersion routing model weighted by the hillslope travel distance distribution of saturated pixels to the <b>main</b> channel <b>network.</b> The shape of the hillslope travel distance is found to consist of an initial spike, representing saturated pixels on the <b>main</b> channel <b>network,</b> and an exponential decay function for those pixels on the hillslope. However, the proportion of saturated pixels on the <b>main</b> channel <b>network</b> varies with total saturated pixels, causing an inverse change of scale of the spike and the exponential decay part. As the number of saturated pixels changes during a storm event, the hillslope IUH is dynamic. The <b>main</b> channel <b>network</b> IUH is also modelled by the linear advection-dispersion model weighted by the normalized width function of the <b>main</b> channel <b>network.</b> Convolution of the hillslope and <b>main</b> channel <b>network</b> IUHs gives the catchment IUH, which is also dynamically changing with the degree of saturation. It is demonstrated that the direct runoff hydrograph is sensitive to the variation of the degree of saturation within and between storm events...|$|R

25|$|On 20 January 1980, the 0/10 Network {{became known}} as Network Ten to reflect ATV moving from channel 0 to channel 10 – {{although}} the Brisbane station continued to broadcast as TVQ-0 until 10 September 1988 when the station changed to TVQ-10. In 1987 Adelaide's Network Ten affiliate (SAS-10) and Seven Network affiliate (ADS-7) successfully negotiated to exchange affiliation rights and channel frequencies due to ownership problems. On 27 December 1987, the exchange came into effect and ADS-7, owned by the same owners as the <b>main</b> <b>Network</b> Ten stations, became ADS-10 with SAS-10 converting to SAS-7, operated by TVW-7 in Perth.|$|E
25|$|Edinburgh Waverley is the <b>main</b> <b>Network</b> Rail station {{serving the}} city.

25|$|Some {{stations}} that broadcast from smaller cities are private affiliates of the CBC, that is, stations which {{are owned by}} commercial broadcasters and air a predominantly CBC schedule. However, most affiliates of the English network opt out of some network programs to air local programming or more popular foreign programs acquired from other broadcasters. Private affiliates of the French network, {{all of which are}} located in Quebec, rarely have the means to provide alternate programming, and thus diverge from the <b>main</b> <b>network</b> schedule only for local newscasts. Such private affiliates are becoming increasingly rare, and there have been indications that the CBC plans to discontinue all affiliation agreements with non-CBC owned television stations in the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|George Stephenson {{had planned}} a West Coast main Line {{to cross the}} mouth of Morecambe Bay and this would have linked Furness with the {{developing}} national rail network. However this plan was shelved in 1843. The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Act was passed on 6 June 1844, establishing this as the route for the main line. Instead of Furness {{becoming part of the}} national rail strategy, it was now a backwater. It could only be connected to the <b>main</b> <b>network</b> by local efforts and these would involve crossing Morecambe Bay, with its notorious tidal quicksands. The Furness Railway directors collectively, led by Burlington, were not keen to take responsibility for this risky project although the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was considering it.|$|E
25|$|BBC Two {{also has}} {{regional}} {{variations in the}} nations: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These versions of BBC Two share the same idents, but with the nation name in the BBC Two box. BBC Two Scotland shows a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel, {{as well as its}} sister channel BBC One Scotland, and the schedules are often mixed around to match. BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt out of the <b>main</b> <b>network</b> schedule, but generally stick to it, only opting out a couple of times each week. Until December 2008, BBC Wales broadcast a special, digital-only channel, BBC 2W, which contained more opt-outs than analogue-only BBC Two Wales. BBC Scotland occasionally broadcast Gaelic-language programmes under the banner BBC Two Alba.|$|E

25|$|The MRT-3 {{maintains}} an underground depot in Quezon City, near North Avenue station. On {{top of the}} depot is TriNoma, a shopping mall owned by the Ayala Corporation. The depot occupies 84,444 square meters (908,948sqft) of space and serves as the headquarters for light and heavy maintenance of the MRT-3, {{as well as the}} operations of the system in general. It is connected to the main MRT-3 network by a spur line. The depot is capable of storing 81 light rail vehicles, with the option to expand to include 40 more vehicles as demand arises. They are parked on nine sets of tracks, which converge onto the spur route and later on to the <b>main</b> <b>network.</b> However, a lot of rail tracks for storage inside the depot were taken by DOTC to repair broken rails, as DOTC's appointed maintenance provider did not purchase spare rails.|$|E
25|$|Tbilisi obtains {{most of its}} {{drinking}} water from the basin of the Aragvi River north of the city. Groundwater (60% of the total) is pumped from well fields, while surface water (40%) is mostly obtained from the reservoir of the Zhinvali Dam 42km from the city. The water is treated in two plants: the Samgori plant built in the 1950s and the Grmagele plant, located at the Zhinvali Dam, built in the 1980s. The length of the water distribution network in Tbilisi is 3,600km. About 35% of the <b>main</b> <b>network</b> is made of iron pipes and 65% of steel pipes. Polyethylene pipes have been installed only recently. There are 84 reservoirs and 169 pumps. The sewer network consists of 1,600km of pipes made of ceramic, reinforced concrete, cast iron, asbestos cement and polyethylene. The wastewater is transferred by trunk sewer with a length of 72km to the Gardabani {{waste water treatment plant}} commissioned in 1979 with a capacity of 1 million m3/day. The biological treatment at the plant is not in operation due to its high energy consumption and the associated high cost. The untreated wastewater is discharged into the Kura River.|$|E
25|$|Quite {{a bit of}} {{controversy}} arose during the 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts, {{as it was the}} first major tournament where the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had full rights to televise the games. Previously, The Sports Network showed all the draws except the semi-final and the final, which was covered by the CBC. However, in a decision made in 2004, the Canadian Curling Association awarded the new contract to CBC, which had a higher bid than TSN. This would mean only the afternoon draws would be covered on the <b>main</b> <b>network</b> while evening draws were shown on the Digital Cable Channel, CBC Country Canada which only reached half a million Canadian homes. Morning draws, which TSN did not want to renew anyway were not shown at all. Many Canadian fans were outraged come Tournament time, as they were disappointed with what many considered inferior coverage on the CBC as well as the scheduling problems. Some games were moved to The Score and some games on CBC Country Canada were cut short because of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations that restricted the channel to only 12.4 hours of sports per week. This angered fans, and the CCA as well as many event sponsors were sent many angry letters and phone calls, some people even threatening to boycott the sponsors.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing {{the injured}} left ankle that {{he picked up}} a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 {{friendly}} loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's <b>main</b> <b>network.</b> However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.|$|E
