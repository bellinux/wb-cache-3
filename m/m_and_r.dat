5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and Briarwood, normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The <b>M</b> <b>and</b> <b>R</b> serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and the R splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve the line at all times, while the M runs on the line during weekdays only and the R runs on the line at all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of Briarwood to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based train control system, would add capacity to the line.|$|E
5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between <b>M</b> <b>and</b> <b>R</b> is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E

25|$|It is from Plato’s {{caution that}} {{in the modern era}} many are aware of {{political}} and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In motion picture rating systems, <b>M</b> <b>and</b> <b>R</b> rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on {{a life of their own}} once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.|$|E

25|$|The {{station has}} four tracks and two island platforms. It is the {{northern}} terminal {{for the local}} <b>M</b> <b>and</b> <b>R</b> trains, which stop on the outer tracks. To the east, the line widens to six tracks, with two tracks starting between the local and express tracks in each direction, then ramping down to a lower level, where they widen to four tracks and run under the 75th Avenue station to Jamaica Yard. F trains stop on the express track at all times, but switch to the local track {{to the east and}} continue on to Jamaica–179th Street. E trains stop on the express tracks at all times except late nights, when they make local stops along the Queens Boulevard Line. To the east, they continue on the express tracks (except evenings and weekends when they switch to the local track like the F) to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer, with limited rush-hour express service to 179th Street.|$|E
