5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the <b>main</b> <b>suspect.</b> But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E

Lamb agrees with him that it was a murder. Lamb calls Mindy O'Dell, the dean's wife and a <b>main</b> <b>suspect,</b> to his office. Logan, Veronica's on-again, off-again boyfriend, visits Veronica in her cell and they are civil to each other. After being released from jail, Veronica is stopped on the street by Josh, who has Mason (Robert Ri'chard) in the trunk of his car, frantically telling Veronica that Mason is the culprit. When Veronica disproves this claim, she tells Josh to call her using a disposable phone within 24 hours. Veronica releases Mason from the trunk.|$|E

Skinner later finds out that someone has used Mulder's FBI pass {{to gain access to the}} X-Files, and that the Bureau task force considers him the <b>main</b> <b>suspect.</b> Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen.

He briefly dates Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris), but soon falls for her best friend, new resident Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). Nick and Sharon fall deeply in love, as she earns Victor's love and trust. However, Nikki is outraged, as she thinks Sharon, who is struggling financially, happens to be using Nick {{to get to the}} Newman fortune. Nonetheless, the relationship continues to blossom. Nick believes that Sharon is a virgin and agrees to wait for her, however, her ex-boyfriend Matt Clark shows up in town to expose Sharon's secret. It is revealed that Sharon gave birth to a daughter at age sixteen, which she gave up for adoption. Nick and Sharon briefly split because of this, but soon reunite. They continue to face problems, such as Sharon being raped by Matt. When Matt is nearly shot to death, Nick becomes the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> and is sent to jail.

However, they soon reunite during a custody battle over Cassie, where they are pronounced her official parents.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the <b>main</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before his death, {{several people}} in Weatherfield had {{well-known}} reasons for wanting Frank dead {{with the investigation}} being focused on five <b>main</b> <b>suspects.</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> {{and three}} of the {{suspected}} associates were remanded into pre-trial detention on 22 August by the Southwest Finland District Court on suspicion of two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent. The <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder with terrorist intent. The motive of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28. According to the German media, the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> and two of the other suspects had previously stayed in Germany and committed crimes under several different identities.|$|E
25|$|According {{to persons}} interviewed at the Pansio {{reception}} centre by national broadcaster Yle, the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> arrived to the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking {{how he could}} join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels. The interviewees warned the reception centre management of this behaviour in January 2017. Helsinki Times published similar interviews afterwards. Yle also reported {{that the police are}} currently monitoring approximately 100 young asylum seeker men in the Southwest Finland area and that the police believe the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> had radicalized fairly quickly during August; for example, his behaviour and clothing style had changed.|$|E
25|$|On February 10, 2015, three college {{students}} {{were killed in}} their home, Finley Forest Condominiums, next to the Friday Center for Continuing Education, University of North Carolina (UNC).

25|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. But he had not yet settled on a killer. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. By making Joe the <b>main</b> <b>suspect,</b> Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie, and improved the narrative structure of the series so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E
25|$|Zoe {{is accused}} of killing the Fusion women and is {{considered}} the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> for the Fusion deaths by a serial killer. Babe doesn't believe this and provides Zoe with safety under her roof and fights back against those who try to harm Zoe, and helps her come out to everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone is accepting.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's husband, Lord Darnley, {{was killed}} in mysterious {{circumstances}} at the Kirk o'Field in Edinburgh on 10 February 1567, and she married the Earl of Bothwell on 15 May 1567. Bothwell was widely {{thought to be the}} <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> for Darnley's murder.

25|$|On 10 September 2009, the Allahabad {{high court}} acquitted Moninder Singh Pandher and {{overturned}} his death sentence. He was not named a <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> by investigators initially, but was summoned as co-accused during the trial. Pandher faces trial in five cases {{out of the}} remaining 12, and could be re-sentenced to death if found guilty {{in any of those}} killings. The same day Pandher was acquitted, the Allahabad high court upheld the death sentence for Surinder Koli, the former domestic servant of Pandher.|$|E
25|$|The Dink {{murder trial}} opened in Istanbul on 2 July 2007. Eighteen people were charged at Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No 14 in {{connection}} with the journalist's assassination. Since the <b>main</b> <b>suspect,</b> Ogün Samast was younger than 18, the hearing was not public. Reportedly, the defendants Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel repeated their testimonies given to the security forces and prosecutor. The court decided to release the defendants Osman Altay, Irfan Özkan, Salih Hacisalihoglu and Veysel Toprak to be tried without remand and adjourned the hearing to 1 October.|$|E

25|$|Four months later, in November 2014, August was tagged as the <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> {{after the}} BMW 325i of {{producer}} Chris Clark went missing {{while on a}} studio session with Santo. Clark had left the car keys {{on a table in}} the studio, but when he went to leave, the keys – and August – were gone. August’s refusal to cooperate ended with Clark going to the authorities. A month later, in December 2014, it was announced by August, via his Twitter account, that he’d been removed from Mindless Behavior.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} believe that some individual(s) may have been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on. Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered {{not to be a}} supernatural creature, but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour. This idea matches the contents of the letter to the Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager. A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Waterford, as the <b>main</b> <b>suspect.</b> Haining suggested this may have been due to him having previously had bad experiences with women and police officers.|$|E
25|$|Gardaí {{established}} that five males {{were involved in}} the shooting and robbery itself, and belong to a larger criminal gang operating in the border region. Those responsible were believed to have fled to Northern Ireland after the killing, and remained there for some weeks. The leader of the five-man gang and <b>main</b> <b>suspect</b> for the murder was identified as a young man from the Crossmaglen area of south Armagh. It is understood he was known to Detective Donohoe, providing a possible motive for his murder. However, Donohoe was originally not scheduled {{to take part in the}} credit union cash escort, making a late shift change with the officer who was originally scheduled to take part in the escort.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>suspects</b> in {{the bombing}} were members of a Sikh separatist group called the Babbar Khalsa (banned in Europe and the United States as a proscribed {{terrorist}} group) and other related groups {{who were at the}} time agitating for a separate Sikh state called Khalistan in Punjab, India.|$|R
50|$|In a {{press conference}} held on 27 April, Võ Tuấn Nhân, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, claimed that the two <b>main</b> <b>suspects</b> of the marine life {{destruction}} were red tide and toxins generated by people. However, the red tide explanation was quickly rejected by the Vietnamese Fisheries Society.|$|R
50|$|The supervillains are the <b>main</b> <b>suspects</b> {{that the}} police want apprehended and brought to justice. Each supervillain has his/her own special tactics and features.
