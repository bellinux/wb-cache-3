40|$|Abstract. The growing {{of goats}} has {{registered}} a sudden change. At {{the base of}} this situation is the production quality obtained from this specie. In these conditions, all the growing efforts of the economical efficiency obtained as a result for the breeding and exploitation for the local population must be intensified. Besides the intensification of the rising preoccupations for the productive level based on the application of different genetic improvement programs, the elaboration of new technologies {{can be one of}} the future priorities. This affirmation is based on the fact that in almost all the traditional regions of <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> are used traditional technologies, which often prove to be uneconomical. In the existing researches we have had as a priority objective the studying of the intensified possibilities of <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> for meat production...|$|R

The other aims are as follows: basic information about parameters of goat production, processing and market of bio-products, economy of <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> and subsidies in <b>goat</b> <b>breeding.</b> The <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> was monitoring at the Slunečná organic farm in the Šumava Mountains. The results were interpreted {{on the basis of the}} study of special literature and legislation about organic farming and ethology of goats. The data set of goat herd daily regime on farm was created. Winter daily regime and summer daily regime were compared. The conditions of <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> were then compared with requirements of legal rules in the Czech Republic and in the EU. The physiological and ethological needs of animals are satisfactory. It is due to modern technologies for stabling, milking, slaughtering and another handling with animals. Goats have the possibility to graze freely on pastures and they effect positively on the landscape management. They keep grasslands without woody plants and weeds...|$|R

40|$|Results of a 2 -year {{study on}} goats and sheep in {{northern}} Burkina Faso are reported. In both goats and sheep, females comprised more than 75 % of flock numbers. Intervals between parturitions in goats were 312 days overall but were significantly {{affected by the}} season of the previous birth: in sheep the interval was 280 days, this also being affected by season. There were 1. 08 kids born per litter in goats and 1. 06 lambs in sheep: litter size in sheep differed significantly between seasons and between years of parturition. Kids weighed 12. 8 kg at 150 days, there being differences due to season and parity: lambs weighed 14. 9 kg, this weight being affected by season, parity and litter size. Seasonal variations in weights of adult female goats and sheep were marked, being about 12 % below the overall annual average weight for each age class in June (end of dry season) and 12 % above the mean in November (post rains). Annual productivity was 22. 1 kg of live young per <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year, 874 g per kg of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year and 2. 08 kg per kg metabolic weight of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year.

40|$|The boer goats which {{originated}} from the South African Republic are continous breeding animals when {{kept in the}} northern hemisphere and they kidd three times in 2 years. In this study, a mixed herd was monitored to determine whether boer goats could induce return to cyclicity in sesonal <b>breeding</b> <b>goats.</b> All goats (n = 20) were pluriparous and kidded during January and February. During January a mixed group was formed (10 boer goats kept together with 10 domestic breed goats). At {{the same time a}} group of domestic breed goats (n = 12), kept in the same manner, 40 km away from the experimental group was used as controls. Blood samples were collected every 72 h to determine level of progesterone in both herds. Goats were monitored {{at the same time to}} observe for signs of oestrus. Progesterone concentrations in sera samples were determined using a RIA method. Data were analysed by ANOVA using Statistica software. We observed visual oestrus in all boer goats and in eight domestic breed goats from the mixed group during March and April. Progesterone concentrations confirmed the presence of functional corpora lutea between two visual cycles in these animals. No visual oestrus or increases in progesterone were observed in the control group of goats.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the rural kebeles around Dire Dawa for designing a simple, yet, feasible breeding scheme in the context of community-based management of animal genetic resources. Range of participatory rural appraisal tools, including focal group discussions and participatory mappings, were employed to study the local community’s Indigenous knowledge and practices in managing the goat gene pool. The breeding objective and local trait preferences were defined in a participatory manner through own-flock ranking experiments. The community generally practices selective pure breeding where by the own flock and flocks in the neighbourhood were the units of selection for bucks. There are social regulations in the community against sale of breeding does outside the community while encouraging communal use of outstanding <b>breeding</b> <b>males.</b> <b>Goats</b> are kept for multifaceted purposes ranging from products like milk, meat and live-sale to functions in socio-cultural, financial and ritual state of affairs. The breeding objective is to ensure improved milk production, through increased daily yield per doe and increased fertility per flock, and increased net income per flock, through increased number of marketable animals. Traditional criteria such as conformation, behaviour and adaptation were as important as most “production” traits in selecting breeding animals. The breeding goal traits considered were, accordingly, milk production, conformation and reproductive traits. Based on these findings, village breeding schemes, where-by flocks and breeding groups in a village are taken as focal points, is recommended as way forward in genetic improvement. The framework for a feasible implementation of such genetic improvement scheme is outlined based on the rationale of utilizing available social regulations, indigenous knowledge and traditional systems of breeding as well as future market prospects...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of the}} paper. The final published version {{is available from the}} Royal Society at [URL] differences in breeding lifespan are an important source of variation in male fitness, the factors affecting the <b>breeding</b> tenure of <b>males</b> have seldom been explored. Here, we use cross-species comparisons to investigate the correlates of <b>breeding</b> lifespan in <b>male</b> mammals. Our results show that <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> lifespan depends on the extent of polygyny, which reflects the relative intensity of competition for access to females. Males have relatively short breeding tenure in species where individuals have the potential to monopolize mating with multiple females, and longer ones where individuals defend one female at a time. <b>Male</b> <b>breeding</b> tenure is also shorter in species in which females breed frequently than in those where females breed less frequently, suggesting that the costs of guarding females may contribute to limiting tenure length. As a consequence of these relationships, estimates of skew in <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> success within seasons overestimate skew calculated across the lifetime and, in several polygynous species, variance in lifetime breeding success is not substantially higher in males than in females. The Leverhulme Trust, the Isaac Newton Trust, and the European Research Council provided the funding for this study...|$|R
