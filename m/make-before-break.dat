50|$|Ayrton shunt or {{universal}} shunt is a high-resistance shunt used in galvanometers {{to increase}} their range without changing the damping.The circuit is named after its inventor William E. Ayrton. Multirange ammeters that use this technique are more accurate than those using a <b>make-before-break</b> switch. Also it will eliminate the possibility of having a meter without a shunt which is a serious concern in <b>make-before-break</b> switches.|$|E
5000|$|Contact {{sequence}} - [...] "Make before Break" [...] or [...] "Break before Make". For example, the old style {{telephone exchanges}} required <b>Make-before-break</b> {{so that the}} connection didn't get dropped while dialing the number.|$|E
50|$|To make a {{multi-range}} ammeter, a {{selector switch}} {{can be used}} to connect {{one of a number of}} shunts across the meter. It must be a <b>make-before-break</b> switch to avoid damaging current surges through the meter movement when switching ranges.|$|E
50|$|A better {{arrangement}} is the Ayrton shunt or universal shunt, invented by William E. Ayrton, {{which does not}} require a <b>make-before-break</b> switch. It also avoids any inaccuracy because of contact resistance. In the figure, assuming for example, a movement with a full-scale voltage of 50 mV and desired current ranges of 10 mA, 100 mA, and 1 A, the resistance values would be: R1=4.5 ohms, R2=0.45 ohm, R3=0.05 ohm. And if the movement resistance is 1000 ohms, for example, R1 must be adjusted to 4.525 ohms.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a switch}} {{contains}} both normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) contacts, {{the order in}} which they make and break can be significant. In most cases, the rule is break-before-make or B-B-M; that is, the NO and NC contacts are never simultaneously closed during the transition between states. This is not always the case, Form C contacts follow this rule, while the otherwise equivalent Form D contacts follow the opposite rule, make before break. The less common configuration, when the NO and NC contacts are simultaneously closed during the transition, is <b>make-before-break</b> or M-B-B.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} loads, however, that are {{affected}} by even the slightest loss of power. There are also operational conditions where it may be desirable to transfer loads with zero interruption of power when conditions permit. For these applications, closed transition transfer switches can be provided. The switch will operate in a <b>make-before-break</b> mode provided both sources are acceptable and synchronized. Typical parameters determining synchronization are: voltage difference less than 5%, frequency difference less than 0.2 Hz, and maximum phase angle between the sources of 5 electrical degrees. This means the engine driving the generator supplying one of the sources generally must be controlled by an isochronous governor.|$|E
50|$|The second uniwave {{method is}} the {{absorption}} method, and it involves two tuned circuits and a single-pole, double-throw, <b>make-before-break</b> key. When {{the key is}} down, the arc {{is connected to the}} tuned antenna coil and antenna. When the key is up, the arc is connected to a tuned dummy antenna called the back shunt. The back shunt was a second tuned circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor, and load resistor in series. This second circuit is tuned to roughly the same frequency as the transmitted frequency; it keeps the arc running, and it absorbs the transmitter power. The absorption method is apparently due to W. A. Eaton.|$|E
50|$|Soft handover: Is one {{in which}} the channel in the source cell is {{retained}} and used for a while in parallel with the channel in the target cell. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection to the source is broken, hence this handover is called <b>make-before-break.</b> The interval, during which the two connections are used in parallel, may be brief or substantial. For this reason the soft handover is perceived by network engineers as a state of the call, rather than a brief event. Soft handovers may involve using connections to more than two cells: connections to three, four or more cells can be maintained by one phone at the same time. When a call {{is in a state of}} soft handover, the signal of the best of all used channels can be used for the call at a given moment or all the signals can be combined to produce a clearer copy of the signal. The latter is more advantageous, and when such combining is performed both in the downlink (forward link) and the uplink (reverse link) the handover is termed as softer. Softer handovers are possible when the cells involved in the handovers have a single cell site.|$|E
30|$|The re-association is {{triggered}} after connectivity {{with the}} previous coordinator is lost. Hence, the cluster handover uses a break-before-make scheme for re-association that increases latency of re-association as compared to <b>make-before-break</b> scheme.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} observations, {{it is evident}} that {{performance}} of WPANs under mobility of devices can be enhanced by decreasing both latency and frequency of re-association. In this work, the latency of re-association during cell change is decreased using the following modifications. Firstly, <b>make-before-break</b> approach is used that reduces the latency of link down detection after cluster change. Secondly, orphan scan is not used because in a <b>make-before-break</b> approach, the end device is already connected to parent coordinator while trying to find new coordinator. Thirdly, passive scan is performed on current channel to decrease the scanning time. Lastly, for high BO networks, beacon order of neighboring coordinators is decreased when weak connectivity is detected by parent coordinator with any of its member device. This helps the weakly connected member device to swiftly select the new coordinator. On the other hand, to decrease the frequency of handover, a new coordinator selection criterion is proposed. It takes into account the quality of link between the devices and mobility of coordinator. As a result, connectivity can be enhanced by selecting both stronger and less mobile links.|$|E
30|$|Equation (4) {{shows the}} basic 802.11 open system {{authentication}} (OSA) case without pre-authentication. The IEEE 802.11 takes a hard handoff break-before-make approach fundamentally, {{which means that}} an STA has to break its connection with its CAP before connecting to a TAP [25]. That is, the connection is disrupted during every HO. Thus, the total authentication delay {{in this case is}} the largest. Equation (5) shows the case of the context transfer scheme such as the trial standard IEEE 802.11 f IAPP withdrawn on 2006. In this protocol, break-before-make movements occur three times in inter-ESS HOs, and <b>make-before-break</b> movements occur four times in inter-subnet HOs. An STA should transfer the security context to the TAP via the CAP, beforehand. Equation (6) shows the standard 802.11 i intra-ESS pre-authentication case referred to as RSNA. In this case, break-before-make movements occur three times in inter-ESS HOs, and <b>make-before-break</b> movements that perform pre-authentication using PMKSA via the CAP indirectly occur four times in intra-ESS HOs. Equation (7) mathematically describes the case of the proposed scheme, which performs pre-authentication with the TAP directly beyond the border of the ESS. In this case, only the CSP operation time is needed, and not the EAP processing time.|$|E
30|$|The {{operation}} of PRA scheme consists of preemptive re-association decision (PRD) and re-association procedure (RAP). PRD is {{taken by the}} coordinator to find which member device has low connectivity and should trigger its RAP. In {{order to ensure that}} devices have <b>make-before-break</b> connectivity, PRD attempts to find weakly connected nodes based on LQI before the link is broken. RAP illustrates the sequence of steps required to associate with a new coordinator that can give longer connectivity. In the remaining of this section, both PRD and RAP are explained in length.|$|E
40|$|Switching {{connectivity}} over multiple wireless interfaces of {{a mobile}} node is essential when performing handover between heterogeneous networks. In such a communication scenario, session continuity as {{experienced by the}} user can be enhanced if soft handover is enabled through the concept of <b>make-before-break.</b> However, some of the available networking protocols need to be modified to support this feature. This work gives an insight into the supplementary modules we implemented and the modification conducted in MIPv 6 model of OMNeT++ to facilitate soft handover and data offloading for mobile nodes.

30|$|Soft {{handover}} algorithms {{are known}} as <b>make-before-break,</b> in which the UE retains the connection with the serving eNodeB while establishing a new connection to the target eNodeB. The main advantage of soft handover is lowered probability of abnormal termination due to handover failure. This is because the connection with the serving eNodeB is broken only when a reliable connection to the target eNodeB has been established. The cost for this advantage is {{that more than one}} channel need to be occupied to support only a single connection, which reduces the number of available channels and thus deteriorates the capacity of the network. The network architecture also becomes more complex since a centralized controller is needed to perform handover control for each UE. Another cost is more complicated UE hardware required to process several channels in parallel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{designed}} and implemented seamless handover on wireless LAN with MISP (Mobile Internet Services Protocol), PDMA (Packet Division Multiple Access) and mobile IP. MISP is a protocol designed for mutual authentication, IP address assignments, session key sharing and various negotiations between mobile nodes and access points {{with a single}} exchange of packets after receiving beacons. By MISP, a mobile node can quickly establish link with access points. PDMA is a new paradigm for duplexing/multiplexing accesses. It uses CSMA/CA not only within cells but also between cells to dynamically allocate communication bandwidth between cells and enables mobile nodes to access simultaneously to all the available access points. PDMA naturally enables mobile nodes to support seamless <b>make-before-break</b> style handover and to find beacons from new access points quickly.

40|$|Abstract—To provide {{seamless}} mobility to {{the wireless}} user, a continuous {{connection to the}} Internet is required while moving from one administration domain to another. To enable continuous connectivity, one prerequisite is the incorporation of seamless handover. The <b>make-before-break</b> approach facilitates seamless handover by means of executing an authentication to a new domain simultaneously while maintaining connection to current domain. The connection is only terminated after the handover to the new domain is successfully completed. However, {{the duration of the}} authentication is critical for the handover process because if the mobile nodes move very fast the remaining amount of time of connection to the current domain can become very limited. Therefore, it is a vital issue for seamless mobility to study the authentication performance of a pre-authentication framework. In this paper we model an authentication infrastructure and consider a scenario in which a high number of nodes handover to a new administration domain. The simulation of the authentication process shows the relation between authentication performance and traffic intensity. Furthermore we identify some critical points and potential bottlenecks of this pre-authentication approach. I...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of the upcoming fourth generation wireless networks is support for heterogeneous radio access technologies in combination with an all-IP type of overall architecture. Operators and users will benefit from a smooth technology transition leveraging existing investments and {{use a variety of}} access technologies simultaneously. This paper describes and evaluates an innovative mobility management scheme in such an environment. It does not require any changes to the IP stack in the mobile node and does not introduce any additional overhead to the payload traffic over air interfaces. Furthermore, it does not add any signaling overhead and outperforms existing mobility management schemes for heterogeneous environments in terms of bandwidth consumption. The architecture uses a <b>make-before-break</b> principle for vertical handovers and bidirectional tunneling using various tunneling mechanisms connecting mobile nodes through access networks to a home network.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile {{wireless}} Internet has created the need for seamless and secure communication over heterogeneous access networks such as IEEE 802. 11, WCDMA, cdma 2000, and GPRS.

We describe the design, implementation and performance of a Secure Universal Mobility (SUM) architecture. It uses standard protocols, such as SIP and Mobile IP, to support mobility and uses standard virtual private network (VPN) technologies (e. g., IPsec) to support security (authentication and encryption). It uses pre-processing and <b>make-before-break</b> handoff techniques to achieve seamless mobility (i. e., with little interruption to users and user applications) across heterogeneous radio systems.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel ?<b>Make-Before-Break?</b> routing {{protocol}} for VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks) which brings stability in route even if it contains some nodes moving opposite to the rest. Few of the existing routing protocols contain the mechanism to prevent route disruption caused by link breakages between oppositely moving nodes in a partitioned network. In our protocol, a node does not forward a RREQ (Route Request) received from a node moving in opposite direction unless a special request is made by that node in RREQ packet. The node which accepts this special request and forwards the RREQ, despite moving opposite to the previous node is called complier node. The complier node adds its information in the RREQ packet. On receiving RREQ, the destination knows that complier node is moving towards some successive nodes in the routing path. Through the RREP (Route Reply), it informs those nodes about the complier node. Each of these successive nodes waits for the approaching complier node. When it comes near, each establishes connection with the complier node on its turn. Thus the route from source to destination is maintained.

40|$|Toward {{seamless}} inter-networking between cellular {{networks and}} Wireless LAN, {{one of the}} major challenges is seamless vertical handover between different access technologies. Even in heterogeneous access networks which provide combined radio coverage, users may still suffer from packet losses due to bad radio conditions during the handover. Eurecom IPv 6 soft handover can reduce packet losses even in the case of vertical handover. Considering that Network Mobility (NEMO) has an advantage of hiding mobility functions from users involved, Eurecom IPv 6 soft handover and NEMO are expected to provide a good combination. This paper proposes IPv 6 soft handover extension for NEMO over heterogeneous access networks to achieve better performance for UDP and TCP traffic. The proposed method called NEMO-SHO uses two different interfaces simultaneously during vertical handovers, and provides good Quality of Service for the users regardless of the radio coverage quality. Using 3 G and IEEE 802. 11 b interfaces, our experiments show that NEMO-SHO can achieve better performances for UDP traffic and constant-bit-rate TCP traffic than <b>Make-Before-Break</b> handovers in lossy radio conditions.

40|$|An ad-hoc {{wireless}} network {{is a collection}} of nodes that come together to dynamically create a network, with no fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes, bandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of {{wireless network}}s (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such as voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming increasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task because of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information. Hence, {{it is important to have}} a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing capability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows. In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing protocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a cross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a node is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of SQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no additional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV possesses a <b>make-before-break</b> re-routing capability that enables near-zero packet drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation, making it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks.

The current approach towards meeting such requirements, which is to retrofit mobility solutions to different layers of the protocol stack, has given rise to an increasingly fragmented network control layer. Furthermore, retrofitting solutions in an ad-hoc manner to the protocol stack does not provide consistent support from the network to different applications. This lack of a common control layer for facilitating roaming in heterogeneous networking environments represents a crucial challenge both technically and from a user perspective.
