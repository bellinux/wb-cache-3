5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, {{but if the}} wall is {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it <b>may</b> <b>become</b> saturated and collapse.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs <b>may</b> <b>become</b> a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm <b>may</b> <b>become</b> a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they <b>may</b> <b>become</b> tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it <b>may</b> <b>become</b> necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E

5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm.

Depending on the person, they <b>may</b> <b>become</b> worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences <b>may</b> <b>become</b> salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

5|$|Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers {{has been}} reported, but they remain {{at a safe}} distance. Under most circumstances, these timid sharks are not {{regarded}} as highly dangerous to humans. However, they <b>may</b> <b>become</b> aggressive {{in the presence of}} food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species. Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and <b>may</b> <b>become</b> visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, <b>may</b> <b>become</b> a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria <b>may</b> <b>become</b> resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, {{have been}} implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and <b>may</b> <b>become</b> contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler.
