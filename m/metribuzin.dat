A study by Chuck Benbrook concluded that the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds had increased US herbicide use. That study cited a 23% increase (.3 kilograms/hectare) for soybeans from 1996-2006, a 43% (.9 kg/ha) increase for cotton from 1996-2010 and a 16% (.5 kg/ha) decrease for corn from 1996-2010. However, this study came under scrutiny because Benbrook did not {{consider the fact that}} glyphosate is less toxic than other herbicides, thus net toxicity may decrease even as use increases. Graham Brookes accused Benbrook of subjective herbicide estimates because his data, provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, does not distinguish between genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops. Brookes had earlier published a study that found that the use of biotech crops had reduced the volume and environmental impact of herbicide and other pesticides, which contradicted Benbrook.

40|$|Herbicides are an {{important}} component of weed management in wheat, particularly in the southeastern US where weeds actively compete with wheat throughout the winter for nutrients and reduce tillering and ultimately the yield of the crop. Some wheat varieties are sensitive to <b>metribuzin,</b> a low-cost non-selective herbicide, leading to leaf chlorosis, stand loss, and decreased yield. Knowledge of the genetics of herbicide tolerance in wheat is very limited and most new varieties have not been screened for <b>metribuzin</b> tolerance. The identification of genes associated with <b>metribuzin</b> tolerance will lead to the development of molecular markers for use in screening breeding lines for <b>metribuzin</b> tolerance. AGS 2035 and AGS 2060 were identified as resistant and sensitive to <b>metribuzin</b> in several previous field screening experiments as well as controlled condition screening of nine varieties in the present study.

In contrast, wheat cv. Spear, which has 50 % common parentage with Blade, showed a strong negative response to <b>metribuzin</b> for both seedling density (B=− 0. 308) and anthesis DM (B=− 0. 482), indicating sensitivity to the herbicide. Sonora 64 and Tezanos Pinto Precoz, parental lines of Blade, were also sensitive to <b>metribuzin</b> (> 187. 5 g/ha), showing similar negative responses to that of Spear for anthesis dry matter (B=− 0. 307 and − 0. 387). However, Kite, which is another parent of Blade, showed excellent tolerance to this herbicide, exhibiting only a small response (B=− 0. 076), which was statistically (P< 0. 05) different from that of Spear. In the second field study, cvv. Blade, EGA Eagle Rock, and Sloop SA barley were again far more tolerant to <b>metribuzin</b> than the sensitive cv.

Glasshouse studies, where <b>metribuzin</b> was highly active in a light sandy potting soil at what would be considered low rates in the field (50 and 100 g/ha), confirmed the sensitivity differences among wheat genotypes observed in the field. Wheat genotypes Blade, Kite, EGA Eagle Rock, and daughter line RAC 0824 were consistently tolerant to <b>metribuzin.</b> Sensitivity to <b>metribuzin</b> (50 g/ha) was observed in Spear, and most parental lines of Blade with the exception of Kite.

40|$|Little {{research}} has been done on pesticide dissipation under cold climates, and {{there is a need to}} focus on the influence of climate on pesticide degradation in soil and the risk of leaching to surface and ground waters. The objective of the work reported here was to increase the knowledge on the fate and risk of leaching of the mobile herbicide <b>metribuzin</b> under cold climatic conditions. Small-scale laboratory investigations of the <b>metribuzin</b> transformation process in soil at temperatures above and below 0 °C have been performed parallel to and for comparison with, <b>metribuzin</b> dissipation studies under field conditions at a field site on silt loam soil (Fluvic Cambisol) in the South East of Norway. As expected, field results indicated faster degradation of <b>metribuzin</b> with increasing temperature, as summer temperatures differed significantly between years. Estimated dissipation rates appeared to be further affected by precipitation patterns, with high precipitation causing faster pesticide transport through the soil profile and possibly bypassing layers of high biological activity. Estimated half-lives close to 1 month during summer were in accordance with other reports, and in good agreement with laboratory scale studies under optimum conditions at 20 °C (t 1 / 2 = 22 days). Sorption experiments showed weak sorption of <b>metribuzin</b> in this silt loam soil (Kd-values below 0. 5), only poorly correlated to soil organic carbon content (r 2 = 0. 76). Laboratory studies of <b>metribuzin</b> degradation and bioavailability at low and below zero temperatures, indicated that frost will increase the mobility of <b>metribuzin</b> in soil by increasing the pore water concentrations upon release of frost; the longer the frost period, the larger the increase in leachable <b>metribuzin</b> concentrations. Further, <b>metribuzin</b> degradation at temperatures below 5 °C was found to be so slow that we would not expect the soil microorganisms to be able to exploit this increased availability of <b>metribuzin.</b> Leaching during cold climatic periods (autumn, winter and spring) in this temporarily frozen soil, will bring <b>metribuzin</b> to deeper soil layers of low biological activity and a generally lower sorption capacity for pesticides, due to lower contents of soil organic carbon. Hence, residues of <b>metribuzin</b> might be recovered in the soil, down to deeper soil layers, one year after spraying. Risk assessment methods for pesticide leaching in cold climatic conditions should consider winter/spring processes, and knowledge about winter processes will be particularly important for forecasting effects of climatic change on leaching...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an {{important}} pulse crop. Canada is the world-leading producer and exporter of lentils, with Saskatchewan alone exporting more than 2. 0 Mt annually. Lentil is a poor competitor with both grasses and broad-leaved weeds, and chemical methods are the main form of control in mechanized broad acre production systems. Imidazolinone (Group 2) tolerance has been developed in lentil, but due to new resistance to this herbicide in weed populations, the use of <b>metribuzin</b> (MB) (Group 5, approved at 206 g a. i. ha- 1) has recently increased in western Canada. However, <b>metribuzin</b> can cause extensive damage to lentil crops under certain environmental conditions. The purpose of these studies was to develop strategies to improve tolerance to <b>metribuzin</b> in lentil through identifying potential genetic sources of improved tolerance and understanding the mode of inheritance of tolerance. Potential <b>metribuzin</b> tolerant F 2 populations were screened at 3 x (618 g a. i ha- 1) rate of <b>metribuzin</b> application for improved resistance. Commercial lentil varieties were screened at 0 x, 0. 5 x, 2 x and 4 x rates to evaluate tolerance to <b>metribuzin</b> to determine if natural variability occurs among genotypes and market classes. A mutagenized population of CDC Redberry was also screened at 10 x (2060 g a. i ha- 1) and three putative tolerant selections were identified.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Equipment for strip-till {{planting}} {{is under}} development in wheat-fallow rotations in the Columbia Basin of Oregon. This involves {{the absence of}} tillage during the fallow season. At planting time, the strip-till planter creates a narrow band into which the wheat seed is placed. The area between the rows is undisturbed except for the deposition of a 2 -cm thick layer of soil displaced from the tilled area. Chemical weed control is required between the rows. Preliminary work has shown that <b>metribuzin</b> [4 -amino- 6 -tert-butyl- 3 - (methylthio) -as-triazin- 5 (4 H) -one] is a promising herbicide for this purpose. Factors influencing the application, effectiveness, and selectivity of <b>metribuzin</b> {{used in conjunction with}} strip-till planting were investigated in the laboratory and greenhouse. Application of <b>metribuzin</b> in combination with liquid fertilizer would be convenient and economical. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the physical compatibility of four liquid fertilizers: Solution 32 at 56 kg N/ha, 10 - 34 - 0 at 45 kg P₂ 0 ₅/ha, 0 - 0 - 15 at 22 kg K/ha, and 11 - 0 - 0 - 26 at 22 kg S/ha, with three <b>metribuzin</b> formulations each of Sencor and Lexone at 112 g a. i. /ha. Wettable powder, flowable, and dispersible granule formulations of both Sencor and Lexone were tested. Only the wettable powder formulations were sufficiently compatible with the liquid fertilizers tested to be recommended for practical commercial use. Large differences were seen between the other formulations. Their use with liquid fertilizers might require the addition of compatibility agents or mixing them with water first, before adding them to the fertilizers. When compatibility is obtained after mixing them with water first, continuous agitation might be required to maintain the suspension. No major differences were observed between comparable formula tions of Sencor and Lexone. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the biological compatibility of Solution 32 and <b>metribuzin</b> on downy brome (Bromus teetorum LJ, the effect of Solution 32 on downy brome and wheat emergence, the effect of soil layer on <b>metribuzin</b> effectiveness for downy brome control, and the effect of banding width over the wheat row and wheat seeding depth on <b>metribuzin</b> phytotoxicity to wheat. More effective downy brome control was obtained when <b>metribuzin</b> was mixed with Solution 32 than when it was used alone. Solution 32 was used at 0, 36, 54, and 79 kg N/ha, and <b>metribuzin</b> at 0, 14, 28, 56, and 112 g a. i. /ha. Solution 32 itself had some phytotoxic effects on downy brome at the high rates. Wheat was not affected as severely as downy brome. Application of <b>metribuzin</b> {{to the surface of the}} newly deposited soil layer was more effective in controlling downy brome than when the herbicide was applied and then covered with the soil layer. Results suggested that better downy brome control could be obtained with <b>metribuzin</b> applied after the strip-tiller had deposited the soil layer between the rows, especially if adequate rainfall is expected. Under such rainfall conditions, <b>metribuzin</b> covered with a soil layer may leach deeper out of the root zone and less effectiveness could result. Both seeding depth of wheat and width of the unsprayed area were factors influencing <b>metribuzin</b> phytotoxicity to wheat. Greater wheat injury was observed when the herbicide was applied on top of, or too close to, the seed row, particularly when wheat was planted shallow.
