5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in <b>my</b> <b>line,</b> having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in <b>my</b> <b>line,</b> not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E

She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's You Asked for It, and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?.</b> Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film To Hell and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed To Hell and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book To Hell and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?</b> and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, {{creators of}} What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?,</b> {{produced}} That's <b>My</b> <b>Line</b> which also highlighted the unusual occupations of ordinary people. However, {{the show was}} developed as a reality show and had no panel or game elements. What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?</b> announcer Johnny Olson was the announcer for the show which ran for two seasons on CBS.|$|E
25|$|In the network's infancy, GSN {{regularly}} showcased vintage Goodson-Todman {{game and}} panel shows from the 1950s and 1960s, {{many of which}} were either originally broadcast or only preserved in black-and-white – such as What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?,</b> I've Got a Secret, To Tell the Truth and Beat the Clock. These classic shows made up much of the channel's lineup at the outset, but have been gradually cut back in prominence since the late 1990s. On October 1, 2006, only What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?</b> had a regular spot on the schedule, late Sunday/early Monday at 3:00a.m. ET; it was followed by a selection from various 1950s, 1960s and 1970s Goodson-Todman shows, usually another panel game. On December 31, GSN reinstated the Black and White Overnight to seven days a week from 3:00 to 4:00a.m. ET, showcasing What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?</b> and I've Got a Secret in the block; other shows, including Choose Up Sides, The Name's the Same, and the Bud Collyer-hosted primetime version of To Tell the Truth have been featured; this run ended March 31, 2009. Black and White Overnight has returned for two weeks in December since 2009, featuring What's <b>My</b> <b>Line?</b> and I've Got a Secret.|$|E

25|$|From 1950 to 1966, {{the game}} show was {{broadcast}} in black-and-white, as {{was typical of}} most game shows at the time.

However, Blyden never got to host the series as he was killed in an automobile accident while traveling in Morocco just before taping was to begin.
