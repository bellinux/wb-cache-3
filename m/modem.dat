5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external <b>modem</b> port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud <b>modem</b> for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external <b>modem</b> simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial <b>modem</b> port could, however, be installed in the internal <b>modem</b> slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Modem</b> Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by <b>modem</b> or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E

5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and <b>Modem</b> Adapter.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless <b>modem</b> company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E
5|$|Internet Connection Sharing, {{supported}} on compatible devices, allows {{the phone to}} share its Internet connection with computers via USB and Bluetooth. Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over PPTP protocol. Most devices with mobile connectivity also have a Radio Interface Layer.

5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbowâ€™ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A <b>modem</b> is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated <b>modem).</b> In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E
5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices.

5|$|Snapdragon {{system on}} chip {{products}} typically include a graphics processing unit (GPU), a global positioning system (GPS) and a cellular <b>modem</b> integrated into a single package. It has software included that operates graphics, video and picture-taking. There are 14 different Snapdragon products under the 200, 400, 600 and the 800 series spanning from low to high-end respectively. Some of their components include the Adreno graphics processing, the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP and processors using Qualcomm's S4 processor architecture. In addition to smartphones, the 400 series is used in smart watches and the 602A is intended for electronics in cars.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio <b>modem</b> integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{building and}} rebuilding of royal palaces in the Renaissance style probably began under James III and accelerated under James IV. These works {{have been seen}} as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun, and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a palatium ad <b>modem</b> castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed, and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.|$|E
