[...] To answer, we might {{attempt to explain}} {{the shape of the}} Milky Way galaxy using the laws of physics, although other observations might be more definitive, that is, provide larger discrepancies or less <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> like the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation or Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The flatness of the Milky Way depends on its rate of rotation in an inertial frame of reference. If we attribute its apparent rate of rotation entirely to rotation in an inertial frame, a different [...] "flatness" [...] is predicted than if we suppose part of this rotation actually is due to rotation of the universe and should not be included in the rotation of the galaxy itself. Based upon the laws of physics, a model is set up in which one parameter is the rate of rotation of the Universe. If the laws of physics agree more accurately with observations in a model with rotation than without it, we are inclined to select the best-fit value for rotation, subject to all other pertinent experimental observations. If no value of the rotation parameter is successful and theory is not within observational error, a modification of physical law is considered, for example, dark matter is invoked to explain the galactic rotation curve. So far, observations show any rotation of the universe is very slow, no faster than once every 60·1012 years (10−13 rad/yr), and debate persists over whether there is any rotation. However, if rotation were found, interpretation of observations in a frame tied to the universe would have to be corrected for the fictitious forces inherent in such rotation in classical physics and special relativity, or interpreted as the curvature of spacetime and the motion of matter along the geodesics in general relativity.|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{monitoring of}} blade vibration under operating conditions {{is essential in}} turbo-machinery testing. Blade tip timing (BTT) is a promising non-contact technique for the measurement of blade vibrations. However, the BTT sampling data are inherently under-sampled and contaminated with several <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> How to recover frequency spectra of blade vibrations though processing these under-sampled biased signals is a bottleneck problem. A novel method of BTT signal processing for alleviating <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in recovery of multi-mode blade vibration frequency spectrum is proposed in this paper. The method {{can be divided into}} four phases. First, a single measurement vector model is built by exploiting that the blade vibration signals are sparse in frequency spectra. Secondly, the uniqueness of the nonnegative sparse solution is studied to achieve the vibration frequency spectrum. Thirdly, typical sources of BTT <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are quantitatively analyzed. Finally, an improved vibration frequency spectra recovery method is proposed to get a guaranteed level of sparse solution when measurement results are biased. Simulations and experiments are performed to prove the feasibility of the proposed method. The most outstanding advantage is that this method can prevent the recovered multi-mode vibration spectra from being affected by BTT <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> without increasing the probe number...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{a finite}} {{elements}} based Digital Volume Correlation (FE-DVC) leads to lower <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in comparison to subset-based approaches. However, the associated computing time may become prohibitive when dealing with high resolution measurements. To overcome this limitation, a PGD solver was recently applied to 2 D digital image correlation. In this paper, this method is extended to measure volumetric displacements from 3 D digital images. In addition, a multigrid PGD algorithm is developed, which allows to use different discretizations in each term of the decomposition. Associated to a coarse graining of the digital images, this allows to avoid local minima, especially in presence of large displacements. Synthetic and practical cases are analyzed with the present approach and <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are compared with standard FE-DVC.

40|$|The radiometric {{calibration}} {{of synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems is typically based on the known backscatter of calibration point targets such as transponders. Before a SAR calibration campaign can begin it is therefore necessary to determine the backscatter (radar cross section or RCS) of the transponder itself. Known methods suffer from unnecessarily high uncertainty contributions and therefore also affect the radiometric uncertainty of the calibrated SAR system. In this paper we present a novel calibration approach which neither requires to disassemble the amplifier path nor necessitates a separate RCS calibration target such as a corner reflector or a circular disk. Significant sources of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> can therefore be outright avoided.

40|$|Laboratory {{measurement}} of irradiance and temperature behaviour of PV modules {{are widely used}} to predict energy produced by PV modules or systems. The inherent <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> have {{so far not been}} {{an essential part of the}} discussion. In this contribution, we investigate how the uncertainty of laboratory characterization propagates to rated energy on an exemplary basis. For three typical modules (c-Si, CdTe, CIS) and three locations, the irradiance and temperature losses were simulated. The input data used for the simulation were module characteristics as measured and modified according to the possible influence of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Statistical uncertainties as well as systematic uncorrected offsets were considered. The resulting uncertainty for expected real world losses is dependent on the location. For irradiance, it is roughly ± 1. 0 for c-Si, ± 1. 5 % for the CIS module under investigation, and ± 2. 5 % for CdTe. Uncertainty of temperature losses was ± 0. 1 % for the locations with low temperature and ± 0. 4 % for higher temperatures for all technologies. The values apply, if <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are minimized. As a consequence of these results, thorough PV module energy rating or PV system yield prediction is possible only with reliable laboratory measurements...|$|R
