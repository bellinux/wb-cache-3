6000|$|Some of {{the chiefs}} had copper rings of home manufacture, with neatly cut raised figures. The king {{held in his}} right hand an article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of split reed, with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals, point with the finger, and without {{pointing}} an African can hardly give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or <b>Malaguetta</b> <b>pepper</b> (Amomum granum Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick, but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys. Professor Smith writes [...] "Sangala woo," [...] and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the unclean hog's- bristle brush of Europe.|$|E
6000|$|The {{banks of}} the winding creek were beautified with the <b>malaguetta</b> <b>pepper,</b> the ipomsea, the hibiscus, and a yellow flower growing upon an aquatic plant like a {{magnified}} water-cress. Animal life became somewhat less rare; we saw sandpipers, hawks, white and black fish-eagles, and long-legged water-hens, here supposed to give excellent sport. An embryo rapid, formed by a gneiss-band connecting the north bank with the islet, delayed us, and the rocks on the right showed pot-holes dug by the poling- staves; during the rains canoes from Boma avoid this place, and seek fuel down stream. After a total of two hours and a quarter we reached Banza Chisalla: it is a [...] "small country," [...] in African parlance, a succursal of Boma proper, the Banza on the hills beyond the reedy, grassy plain. The site is charming--a flat palm-orchard backed by an amphitheatre of high-rolling ground, and the majestic stream approaches it through a gate, whose right staple is the tall Chisalla, and whose left is a rocky islet with outlying needles.|$|E

According to that 'chief factor for the African Company,' the merchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for {{cardamoms}} and ivory. This was {{during the reign of}} Charles V., and between 1364 and 1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief stations were Goree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian coast, then called 'of Grain,' from the 'Guinea grains' or <b>Malaguetta</b> <b>pepper</b> (Amomum granum Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold Coast. Here they founded 'Petit Paris' upon the Baie de France, at 'Serrelionne;' 'Petit Dieppe,' {{at the mouth of the}} St. John's River, near Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and 'Cestro' [Footnote: Now generally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the Portuguese cestos--pepper.] or 'Sestro Paris,' where, three centuries afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence Admiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little 'Boutoo' of our charts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still preserved in the great western prairies.|$|E
