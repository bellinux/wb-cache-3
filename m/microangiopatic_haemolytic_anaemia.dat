40|$|Methods: Serum cardiac {{troponin}} I {{concentrations were}} measured in 11 healthy dogs, 27 dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> and 49 hospitalised dogs without primary cardiac or haematological disorders. Results: Dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> have higher serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I than hospitalised ill dogs (P < 0. 005) and healthy dogs (P < 0. 01). Using a cut-off {{of less than}} 0. 1 ng/mL, 20 of 27 dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> had increased serum cardiac troponin I concentrations, which was a significantly higher proportion compared to the hospitalised ill dogs (P < 0. 001, 16 out of 49 dogs) and healthy dogs (P < 0. 05, 3 out of 11 dogs). Clinical Significance: Dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> have {{a higher incidence of}} subclinical myocyte damage than healthy dogs or dogs with non-haematological or primary cardiac illnesses.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia’s</b> are characterised by {{increased}} RBC destruction {{and evidence of}} accelerated erythropoiesis. Haemolysis due to intrinsic RBC disorders, i. e. the inherited <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias</b> are more common. Most of these anaemias are easily recognisable under the light microscope. MATERIALS AND METHODS To study the clinical and morphological profile {{of different types of}} <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> due to RBC defects in patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala, India. RESULTS A cross-sectional study was carried out among 217 patients of <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> admitted in a tertiary care hospital over a period of five years from January 2012 to December 2016. The data on sociodemographic profile, relevant clinical history and clinical examination were collected in predesigned and pretested standard proforma and morphological parameters were assessed by using standard guidelines. CONCLUSION Sickle cell anaemia was found to be the most common of <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias</b> reported in the hospital. HbE and HbD are extremely rare entities with only a single case report each. A single case of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) was reported, this was included as it is an intrinsic RBC disorder...|$|R

40|$|ALTHOUGH {{red cell}} {{survival}} is reduced in many patients with Hodgkin's disease, frank <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> is uncommon. Auto-immune haemolysis is rare, and {{little is known}} of the mechanisms involved {{in the majority of}} cases (Bowdler and Prankerd, 1962). This report concerns two cases of Hodgkin's disease with clinically significant <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> one of whom had fully developed hypersplenism. Both were found to have, in addition, grossly deficient immunoglobulin levels, a rare occurrence in Hodgkin's disease (Videbaek, 1962, personal communication; Hoffbrand, 1964).

40|$|SYNOPSIS A {{patient with}} {{infectious}} mononucleosis complicated by acute <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> is described. The patient had, {{in addition to}} non-specific cold agglutinins in the serum, a positive Donath-Landsteiner reaction {{in the absence of}} syphilis. The association of a positive Donath-Landsteiner reaction with <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> in infectious mononucleosis has been described only once before. Acute <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> is an uncommon compli-cation of infectious mononucleosis. In a recent survey of the literature on this subject only 53 cases were found (Worlledge and Dacie, 1969). Hoagland (1967) stated that approximately 3 % of the patients in his series of 500 cases had <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia.</b> In addition to the heterophil antibodies reactive with sheep red cells, which are a major criterion for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, patients with this condition have often been found to have other hetero- and autoantibodies {{in the course of the}} illness. These include reagins, which give rise to false positive Wassermann reactions (Zarafonetis and Kent, 1954; Carter 1966), rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor, an antibody similar to anti-thyroglobulin, and possibly leucoagglutinins (Carter, 1966). Autoantibodies to red cells are found not infrequently and may be associated with auto-immune <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Those most commonly described are cold agglutinins, either non-specifi...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} whether heightened {{platelet activation}} {{is a common}} feature of canine immune-mediated <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and to evaluate the hypothesis that platelet activation {{plays a role in}} the pathogenesis of thromboembolism. Methods: Using whole-blood flow-cytometric analysis, the proportion of activated platelets and platelet-leucocyte aggregates in blood samples from 14 dogs with immune-mediated <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> and 14 healthy dogs was calculated. General linear models with binomial errors were used to compare groups. Results from the immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia-affected dogs were then correlated with established risk factors for thromboembolism in canine immune-mediated <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> D-dimer concentration and antithrombin activity. Results: There was a strong correlation between platelet activation and severe thrombocytopenia, with heightened platelet activation being observed predominantly in severely thrombocytopenic dogs. Clinical Significance: Dogs with immune-mediated <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> particularly those with concurrent severe thrombocytopenia, are likely to have heightened platelet activation, which {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of thromboembolism...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} surface {{counting}} with 51 Cr-labelled red cells in predicting response to splenectomy in <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> has been analysed in 18 cases.

The reasons for these discrepancies are discussed, The only patient who completely failed to respond to splenectomy had a sideroblastic element to the anaemia.

40|$|Hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> is {{any of a}} {{heterogeneous}} group of anaemias characterised by increased destruction/haemolysis of erythrocytes because of inherited erythrocyte membranopathies, enzymopathies, or haemoglobinopathies. The affected erythrocytes, of normal morphology or not, are more fragile, less deformable, and more susceptible to shear and oxidative damages. Erythrocytes, as most of eukaryotic cells, constitutively release phospholipid extracellular vesicles in vitro and in vivo in {{a process known as}} vesiculation. These extracellular vesicles embrace {{a heterogeneous}} group of vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins. They are described in literature as exosomes if they are of endosomal origin or as microvesicles if vesicles are formed by a one-step budding process directly from the plasma membrane. Extracellular vesicles contain a multitude of bioactive molecules which are implicated in intercellular communication and in different biological and pathophysiological processes. Mature erythrocytes release mainly microvesicles. In hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias,</b> the underlying diverse molecular defects alter and determine erythrocyte vesiculation, which results in shedding microvesicles of different compositions and concentrations. Despite extensive research into erythrocyte biochemistry and physiology, {{little is known about the}} deformability of erythrocytes and their vesiculation in hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias.</b> Moreover, the impact of erythrocyte-derived microvesicles on the pathophysiology of hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias</b> is not completely assessed. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding extracellular vesicles biology, with a focus on erythrocyte vesiculation. Also, we review recent scientific findings about the molecular defects of hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias,</b> and their correlation with erythrocyte deformability and vesiculation. Integrating the bio-analytical findings about abnormalities of erythrocytes and their microvesicles may be critical for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of hereditary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{cases are}} {{described}} in which severe mechanical <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> developed shortly after operation for repair of non-rheumatic mitral regurgitation.

Subclinical haemolysis or mild <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> may occur with unoperated valve lesions, but hitherto frank <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> has been observed only when turbulent blood flow {{is associated with the}} presence of a prosthetic valve or patch of prosthetic fabric.
