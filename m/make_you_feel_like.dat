They <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the most horrible {{person in the world}} and that your house is the temple of doom."

NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E

The developers noted that the city setting allowed them to create more varied environments. Capcom also decided to give the game a more action-oriented style, {{which resulted in the}} 180-degree turn and the introduction of a dodge feature so that the player can avoid enemy attacks. Additionally, the developers designed the game so that up to nine enemies can appear {{at the same time and}} improved their artificial intelligence to hunt the player up and down stairs. The eponymous Nemesis creature was inspired by the liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator from [...] According to Mikami, [...] "I wanted to introduce a new kind of fear into the game, a persistent feeling of paranoia. The Nemesis brings that on in spades. When it disappears after the first confrontation, you live in constant dread of the next attack.

[...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't have to believe to enjoy." [...] Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: [...] "The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling." ...|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I could get my hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E

Sun {{is related to the}} 'universe, space and stars'-feel of the album, which is also strongly connected to the lyrics." [...] Although the songs that would appear on Wintersun had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track's respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he'd been playing since 1996.|$|E

Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods", while TweakTown said that [...] "some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn’t, and others just sending a shiver up your spine as you hit redline".

[...] The album contained the band's first single, [...] "I'm in Trouble", Westerberg's [...] "first truly good song". Sorry Ma included the song, [...] "Somethin to Dü", a homage to another Minneapolis punk band, Hüsker Dü. The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which started when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over Hüsker Dü, and Hüsker Dü landed an opening slot at a Johnny Thunders gig that the Replacements had wanted. Hüsker Dü also influenced the band's music. The Replacements began playing faster and became more influenced by hardcore punk. Despite this, the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene.

In contrast, The Verge and Ars Technica claimed they were unable to reach the device's advertised battery life. PC Magazine praised the Priv's call quality, noting that it had a clear microphone and [...] "delivers very loud maximum speakerphone and earpiece volume with zero distortion or wobble."
