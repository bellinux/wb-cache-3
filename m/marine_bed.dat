A. ” (Asturias, Spain) in order to collect specimens of Carboniferous ostracodes. Two new species of Hollinella were found and are being described in this article. Besides it turned out that, at least in this coal-mine, the <b>marine</b> <b>bed</b> from which the fossils were collected directly overlies one of the two productive zones in the mine.

40|$|A buried Holocene <b>marine</b> <b>bed</b> was {{discovered}} upon drilling a water well in Algarrobo (33 ° 22 'S), {{located on the}} coast of central Chile. Radiocarbon dating of a wood fragment found within the deposit indicates an age of 6450 cal yr BP. The top of this bed, 0. 25 m-thick, was reached at an elevation of 3. 8 m above mean sea level. This bed contains abundant monospecific faunas of foraminifers (Ammonia tepida) and ostracodes (Cyprideis beaconensis), indicative of deposition in a very shallow, transitional marine environment. Palynologic analysis reveals a Chenopodiaceae-dominated (~ 70 %) assemblage, indicating a relatively arid and warm climate...|$|E
40|$|The {{amounts of}} silt and clay {{in the coastal}} sands and the marine sediments of Nagura Bay were small as {{compared}} with Kabira Bay, which has a narrower bay mouth. Main primary minerals of the coastal sands and the marine sediments were quartz and feldspar in both Nagura {{and the head of}} Kabira Bay. Small amounts of aragonite were in the marine sediments of Nagura Bay. Whereas, considerable amounts of calcite and aragonite were in the coastal sands and the marine sediments in the bay mouth and the bay center of Kabira Bay. The above-mentioned differences were assumed to be due to the difference {{in the shape of the}} bays, particularly to the bay mouth features.

40|$|The Upper Miocene {{succession}} of Crevillente presents an alternation of continental and <b>marine</b> <b>beds.</b> The <b>marine</b> fossils {{have been studied}} {{in order to obtain}} a reliable correlation with other marine sections. On the basis of these data, the entire section can be dated as Upper Tortonian/Messinian. The alternation of continental and <b>marine</b> <b>beds</b> fits the known eustatic sea-level and climatic curves. These correlations are used to assign ecological preferences to the components of the micromammal faunas at species level; it becomes clear that working at the genus level does not provide valid results. With the assignments, it is possible to demonstrate consistent climatic differences between the coastal plain of Crevillente and the area of Teruel on the Meseta of Central Spain. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Marine mining {{is defined}} "a {{commercial}} recovery of minerals other than {{oil and gas}} {{from the surface of}} or below the seabed by operations connected only indirectly with land (i. e., by ships or pipelines). " A great deal has been said and written-particularly in the last decade-about the mineral potential of the seabed. The demand for most minerals and mineral base commodities has increased at almost an exponential rate. Accompanied by the demand has been a considerable and steady increasing effort devoted to research and development of new technologies needed for marine mining. However, the number of operations falling within the definition of marine mining and the number of countries involved are remarkably limited. Indeed, as if to mirror the increasing demand for minerals concerned, the volume of literature on marine mining also seems to be increasing exponentially-it is almost {{to the point where it}} is tempting to suggest that publishing is the largest sector of the marine mining industry. The current status of mining, research, and commodities may be classified in six categories: 1) The production of sulfur from offshore wells. 2) Marine manganese nodules. 3) Phosphorites. 4) Sand, shells, and gravels from the <b>marine</b> <b>bed.</b> 5) Marine placer mining. 6) Hard-rock mining under the ocean...|$|E
40|$|Since {{last twenty}} years, we have {{clarified}} the stratigraphy, paleontology and neotectnics of the Osaka Group in the Saho and Nishinara Hills {{and the eastern}} part of the Nara Basin. On the contrary, there is little information about correlative strata deposited in the Nara Basin. Several core samples were recovered from these strata at the middle-western area of this basin by Kinki-Noseikyoku. Such plant micro fossils as dinoflagellate cysts, Chlorophyceae, spores, pollen and acritarchs were obtained from these materials. Based on stratigraphical and paleontological evidences obtained from the core samples, the followings are newly added. i) The occurrence of marine dinoflagellate cysts indicates that the strata mainly composed of sand and mud intercalate three marine beds at least. ii) Such characteristic dinoflagellate cyst assemblage as abundance of Polysphaeridium zoharyi (ROSSIGNOL) and presence of Hystrichokolpoma rigaudiae DEFLANDRE & COOKSON suggests that the lower <b>marine</b> <b>bed</b> (- 75. 0 ～ 80. 5 m) is assigned to Ma- 1 Bed distributed on the Saho-Nishinara Hills. iii) The middle and upper marine beds (- 42. 3 ～ 45. 2 m and - 25. 0 ～ 28. 3 m respectively) are tentatively correlative with Ma- 2 and Ma- 3 Beds of the Osaka Group. iv) The lower part of these strata (from - 75. 0 to - 188 m) is probably assigned to the lower parts of the Osaka Group...|$|E
40|$|The Ilerdian Stage {{was created}} by Hottinger and Schaub in 1960 to {{accommodate}} a significant phase in the evo¬lution of larger foraminifera not recorded in the northern European basins, and has since been adopted by most researchers working on shallow marine early Paleogene deposits of the Tethys domain. One of the defining cri¬teria of the stage is a major turnover of larger foraminifera, marked by the FO's of Alveolina vredenburgi (for¬merly A. cucumiformis) and Nummulites fraasi. There is now conclusive evidence that this turnover was coeval {{with the onset of}} the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) and, consequently, with the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary, a temporal correspondence that reinforces the usefulness of the Ilerdian as a chronostratigraphic sub¬division of the early Eocene in a regional context. However, in addition to the paleontological criteria, the defin¬ition of the Ilerdian was also based on the designation of two reference sections in the southern Pyrenees: Tremp (stratotype) and Campo (parastratotype). In both sections, the base of the stage was placed at the lowest <b>marine</b> <b>bed</b> containing A. vredenburgi specimens. Using the CIE as a correlation tool we demonstrate that these two marine beds occur at different chronological levels, being older in Campo than in Tremp. Further, we show that both beds are in turn younger than the lowest strata with Ilerdian larger foraminifera at the deep-water Ermua section in the Basque Basin (western Pyrenees). Since the age of stage boundaries must be the same everywhere, the choice of these stratotype sections was misleading, since in practice it resulted in the Ilerdian being used as a facies term rather than as a chronostratigraphic unit. To eliminate that conflict, and yet be respectful with established tradition, we propose to redefine the Ilerdian Stage following a procedure similar to the one used by the International Commission on Stratigraphy to establish global chronostratigraphic standards, namely: by using a "silver spike" to be placed in the Tremp section {{at the base of the}} Claret Conglomerate, a widespread lithological unit that in the Tremp-Graus Basin coincides with the onset of the CIE. The redefined regional Ilerdian Stage becomes thus directly correlatable to the lower part of the global Ypresian Stage, as cur¬rently defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy...|$|E

40|$|Sand {{jets and}} {{particle}} clouds {{are common in}} many engineering areas such as <b>marine</b> <b>bed</b> capping, dredging, and artificial island construction. Because of {{the wide range of}} their application, a better understanding of particle cloud?s behavior will lead to increase the efficiency of engineering systems and lead to an improvement in predicting the behavior of solid-liquid flows. There are many parameters that can control the behavior of particle clouds behavior such as nozzle diameter do, particle size D 50, released mass m, impact velocity of sand particles (at the surface) ui and initial oblique angle of the particle cloud. Moreover, some characteristics of two-phase flows such as entrainment coefficient and drag coefficient can be very important for controlling the impact of the two-phase flow. In this research, laboratory experiments were conducted to find the impact of controlling parameters on the dynamics of vertical and oblique particle clouds in the water media. For considering the impact velocity of sand particles on the surface, the ui was varied by changing the release height H. Nozzle size and mass of particles were grouped to form a non-dimensional parameter as aspect ratio Lo/do, where Lo is a length of sand particles occupied in a pipe with a nozzle diameter of do. It was found that the modified initial energy and circulation are correlated with Lo/do. A direct correlation between the width and frontal velocity of particle clouds with Lo/do was found. These relationships were formulated power law equations and can be used for prediction of cloud size and its frontal velocity. A wide range of particle sizes (D 50 = 0. 1375 mm? 0. 718 mm) was used to study the effects of particle size on spreading of sand jets and particle clouds. Effects of Lo/do and particle size on the evolution of sand particles in water media was also investigated. It was found that particle clouds with small particle sizes (D 50 = 0. 1375 mm) formed a sphere shape whereas particle cloud with a large particle size (D 50 = 0. 595 mm) forms an arc shape...|$|E
40|$|Banded iron {{formations}} were a prevalent {{feature of}} marine sedimentation ~ 3. 8 – 1. 8 {{billion years ago}} and they provide key evidence for ferruginous oceans. The disappearance of banded iron formations at ~ 1. 8 billion years ago was traditionally taken as evidence for the demise of ferruginous oceans, but recent geochemical studies show that ferruginous conditions persisted throughout the later Precambrian, and were even a feature of Phanerozoic ocean anoxic events. Here, to reconcile these observations, we track the evolution of oceanic Fe-concentrations by considering the temporal record of banded iron formations and <b>marine</b> red <b>beds.</b> We find that <b>marine</b> red <b>beds</b> are a prominent feature of the sedimentary record since the middle Ediacaran (~ 580 million years ago).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Late Triassic {{sandstones}} from Quadrant 22 in the North Sea contain {{two generations}} of chlorite cement. Grain-coating chlorites consisting of curved, irregular crystal plates formed very early in diagenesis and are largely confined to marginal <b>marine</b> <b>beds.</b> Later diagenetic pore-filling chlorites, consisting of euhedral platy crystals, occur throughout the sequence in fluvial as well as marginal <b>marine</b> <b>beds.</b> Both generations of cement show similar XRD patterns; the 001 basal reflection of 14. 0 - 14. 06 A is broad and of low intensity, whereas the 002 reflection at 7. 05 A is sharp and intense. Slight contraction of the 14 A basal spacing to 13. 6 A occurs after heating to 600 ~ Electron microprobe analyses show the cements to be Fe-tich clinochlores with Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios varying between 0. 41 and 0 - 50. They are more Mg-and Si-enriched than most other reported North Sea authigenic chlorites. The grain-coating chlorites have an average composition of (Fe 3. 06 A 13. 93 Mg 3. 32) [(Si 6. 76 All. 24) O 20] (on) l 6. The pore-filling chlorites tend to show more variable compositions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Surface and {{subsurface}} {{data are}} combined {{to determine the}} structure of the western half of the Simi fault system in the Las Posas and Camarillo Hills area. Cretaceous (?) to Eocene sedimentary rocks, present only in the subsurface, are overlain by late Eocene to early Miocene nonmarine stata (Sespe Formation) and middle Miocene volcanics and sedimentary rocks (Conejo Volcanics and Topanga Formation undifferentiated), in part exposed in the Las Posas Hills. Late Miocene <b>marine</b> <b>beds</b> (Modelo Formation) are present in the subsurface in the Camarillo Hills and may crop out in the eastern Santa Rosa Valley. These rocks are overlain unconformably by <b>marine</b> Pliocene-Pleistocene <b>beds</b> (Saugus Formation), older and younger Quaternary alluvium, and alluvial fan deposits. Normal faults cause the Sespe to subside towards a thick volcanic pile, built up in the Conejo Hills in the middle Miocene.

30|$|Following a subaerial eruption, primary tephra grains are transported {{through the}} air before falling onto the water surface and {{settling}} through the water column to the sea floor. During the transportation process, grain separation can occur, potentially resulting {{in the formation of}} normal and/or reverse grading structures in <b>marine</b> tephra <b>beds.</b> For example, large pumice grains might remain afloat on the water surface for extended periods, settling later, and thus forming the upper part of a tephra bed. Large pumice grains might also be transported by ocean currents, forming a drift pumice layer distal to the main tephra distribution. Examples of drift pumices occur on marine terrace deposits along the Japan Sea coastline (Toyokura et al. 1991; Shiraishi et al. 1992).
