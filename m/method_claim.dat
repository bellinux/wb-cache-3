[...] Legal obligations (such as options and futures contracts) and business risks [...] "cannot meet the test because they are not physical objects or substances, and they are not representative of physical objects or substances."

2500|$|<b>Method</b> <b>claim</b> 1 of {{the patent}} {{application}} claims a three-step method for a broker to hedge risks for purchaser-users of an input {{of a product}} or service (termed a commodity). For example, an electric power plant might be a purchaser and user of coal, which it purchases from coal-mining companies (producer-sellers) and uses to make electricity. The power plant might seek to insulate itself from upward changes {{in the price of}} coal by engaging in [...] "hedging" [...] transactions. The risk can be quantified in terms of dollars (termed a [...] "risk position"). Thus, if the purchaser-user uses 1000 tons of coal in a given period, and the potential price spike is $10 per ton, the purchaser-user's total risk position for that period is 1000 × $10, or $10,000.|$|E
2500|$|First, the Court said, the {{distinction}} between method and product claims is insupportable. In United States v. Univis Lens Co., [...] the most recent decision of the Court on exhaustion, some of the patents held exhausted were method patents. Earlier, in Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, some patents covered a method of combusting gasoline in an automobile engine––and the exhaustion doctrine was held applicable. Furthermore, because {{it is easy to}} write patent claims for the same invention either in method format or apparatus format, the exhaustion doctrine could easily be evaded if reliance on method claims was sufficient to avoid exhaustion: [...] By “including a <b>method</b> <b>claim</b> for the machine’s patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.” ...|$|E
40|$|This Issue Brief {{examines}} {{recent cases}} addressing the patent eligibility of computer-implemented <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> and their {{implications for the}} development of cloud computing technologies. Despite the Supreme Court’s refusal to endorse the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive patent eligibility inquiry, lower courts have continued to invalidate <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> using a stringent “particular machine” requirement alongside the requisite abstract ideas analysis. This Issue Brief argues that 1) post-Bilski v. Kappos cases have failed to elucidate what constitutes a particular machine for computer-implemented methods; 2) in light of substantial variance among Federal Circuit judges’ Section 101 jurisprudence, the application of the particular machine requirement has become subject to a high degree of panel-dependency, such that its relevance for analyzing software <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> has come under question; 3) notwithstanding the unease expressed by practitioners and scholars for the future of cloud computing patents, the courts’ hardening stance toward computer-implemented <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> will do little to deter patenting in the cloud computing context. Instead, clouds delivering platform and software services will remain capable of satisfying the particular machine requirement and supporting patent eligibility, especially given the possible dilution of the particular machine requirement itself...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> fell {{within the}} {{dictionary}} {{concept of a}} ’process,” but {{were excluded from the}} statutory meaning of that term by the decision in Bilski. That decision holds that the Supreme Court’s machine-or-transformation test is the “definitive test to determine whether a process claim is tailored narrowly enough to encompass only a particular application of a fundamental principle rather than to pre-empt the principle itself.” Claim 1 does not satisfy either prong of the machine-or-transformation test. “Applicants’ <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> are not tied to any particular machine or apparatus. Although Applicants argue that the <b>method</b> <b>claims</b> are tied to the use of a shared marketing force, a marketing force is not a machine or apparatus,” because it is not a “mechanical device or combination of mechanical powers and devices to perform some function and produce a certain effect or result.’” ...|$|R

50|$|Under present U.S. patent law, a <b>method</b> <b>claim</b> of {{a patent}} is infringed {{only when a}} single actor {{performs}} {{each step of the}} claim. Similarly, induced infringement of a <b>method</b> <b>claim</b> has the same requirement. System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system. Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a <b>method</b> <b>claim,</b> whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.|$|E

50|$|The {{two most}} common {{defenses}} to {{a claim for}} patent infringement are non-infringement and invalidity. The defense of non-infringement is {{that at least one}} element of an asserted claim is not present in the accused product (or {{in the case of a}} <b>method</b> <b>claim,</b> that at least one step has not been performed). The defense of invalidity is a counter-attack on the patent itself., i.e., the validity of the patent and the allegedly infringed claims.|$|E

5000|$|However, the Federal Circuit {{pointed out}} these two cases were {{actually}} different.

5000|$|Bilski points out, and the PTO {{recently}} {{emphasized in}} a memorandum to its Examining Staff, {{that there are}} two [...] "corollaries" [...] to the machine-or-transformation test. First, a mere field-of-use limitation is generally insufficient to make an otherwise ineligible <b>method</b> <b>claim</b> patent-eligible. The PTO Guidance Memo explains that “this means the machine or transformation must impose meaningful limits on the method claim's scope it to pass the test.” What makes a limitation meaningful is unstated, but perhaps that concept can be defined in terms of whether the limitation places only an insubstantial limitation on claim scope or preemptiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The Board of Appeal first drew a {{distinction}} between a method for doing business as such, excluded under Article 52(2)(c) EPC (Article 52(2) EPC provides that methods for doing business are not regarded as inventions {{within the meaning of}} [...] ), and a method for doing business having a technical character. The mere fact that data processing and computing means, i.e. technical means, are recited in a <b>method</b> <b>claim</b> does not necessarily confer a technical character to the claimed method. In other words, [...] "technical means for a purely nontechnical purpose and/or for processing purely nontechnical information does not necessarily confer technical character".|$|E

The method is implemented with a “particular machine”—“a rotating laser source mounted directly on a shaft driven directly by a motor mounted on a portable pedestal” (<b>method</b> <b>claim</b> 14). But it is debatable whether entertaining a cat may be considered a useful Art, and some may argue that this “discovery” {{is not the kind}} of discovery that the Patent Clause contemplates.|$|E
