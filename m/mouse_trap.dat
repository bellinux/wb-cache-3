Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game <b>Mouse</b> <b>Trap.</b> The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby.

500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Final Destination films is the {{threshold}} or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. Conrich frames the complex death sequences in Final Destination films as [...] "death games, contraptions or puzzles {{in which there are}} only losers", which he compares to Rube Goldberg machines, the Grand Guignol, and <b>Mouse</b> <b>Trap.</b> Brinkema picks out the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from Final Destination 3 as epitomizing the death sequences in the Final Destination series. The characters' deaths are brought about by [...] "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen doorstop. The scene utilizes logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the deaths of the characters, as well as to allow Wendy to recognize the threat that they face. The [...] "literal tipping point", at which the characters can no longer escape, occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an air-conditioning unit, which was turned on by the rising heat. Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as paradigmatic of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the [...] "theatrics and kinetics" [...] of the former.|$|E

[...] Wilfrid Smith in the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: [...] "The difference between victory and defeat yesterday was Daley. [...] Few players ever have so throroly [...] dominated an offense." [...] On the game's first play from scrimmage, Daley scored on a 37-yard sweep around the right end, [...] "tearing out of a tackler's arms on the 10 yard line." [...] Elroy Hirsch also scored on three-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. [...] Hirsch's touchdown was set up by a 67-yard [...] "quick kick" [...] by Hirsch that was rolled dead at the Northwestern one-yard line. Northwestern was forced to punt into the wind, giving Michigan good field position at the Northwestern 29-yard line. Northwestern scored on a 12-yard run by 1943 Western Conference MVP Otto Graham in the fourth quarter. [...] Thirty seconds after the touchdown by Graham, Daley scored on a 64-yard run, described in one account as [...] "a <b>mouse</b> <b>trap</b> play." [...] On Daley's long run, Northwestern's Otto Graham, playing at the safety position, was the last man Daley needed to pass. [...] Daley ran directly at Graham and [...] "then cut away cleanly" [...] for the touchdown. [...] Merv Pregulman converted on all three extra point kicks for Michigan. [...] Pregulman also intercepted a pass thrown by Graham to stop a late drive by the Wildcats. [...] Through the first three games, Michigan's backs had combined for 753 rushing yards.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRAcr. -Data {{obtained}} from published studies and from <b>mice</b> <b>trapped</b> {{for use in}} our laboratory were analyzed to determine the relationship between frequency of t-haplotypes in wild house mice (Mus musculus) and other variables such as sex, age at capture, and kind of t-haplotype found in the population. In addition, the frequency of t-alleles in populations from which mice had been sampled repeatedly was examined to determine whether, within populations, frequency of t-haplotypes tends to change over time. Populations in which semilethal haplotypes predominated had higher frequencies of heterozygous animals than populations in which the predominant haplotype was a lethaL Furthermore, frequencies of t-haplotypes were higher in males than in females.

40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} whether rodents that are intensely {{exposed to the}} deer tick–transmitted agents of Lyme disease, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and human babesiosis are also exposed to deer tick virus (DTV), we assayed serum samples from white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) in sites densely infested by deer ticks. To conduct serosurveys, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay by cloning, expressing, and purifying {{a portion of the}} DTV envelope glycoprotein (DTV rE) for use as test antigen. Sera from <b>mice</b> and voles <b>trapped</b> in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin were screened by ELISA for IgG reactive to DTV rE. Samples that were positive or borderline by ELISA were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples reactive in both assays were considered to be positive. Three percent of 264 mouse samples collected from sites in Rhode Island, 3. 8 % of 52 samples from <b>mice</b> <b>trapped</b> in Wisconsin, and 3. 9 % of 282 samples collected from <b>mice</b> <b>trapped</b> on Nantucket Island, MA were positive. No samples from either Great Island, MA, or voles from any study site were reactive. A reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction yielded molecular evidence of DTV infecting questing adult deer ticks in sites where seroreactive <b>mice</b> were <b>trapped,</b> but not from ticks collected where serologic evidence of virus perpetuation was absent. White-footed mice appear to be exposed to DTV in certain sites where other deer tick-borne agents perpetuate. This virus may be maintained in the same enzootic cycle...|$|R
