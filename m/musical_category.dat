500|$|Kinky Boots {{received}} a season-high 13 Tony Award nominations. Matilda, which The New York Times {{described as the}} [...] "unalloyed critical hit" [...] of the season, received 12 nominations, 11 {{of them in the}} same categories as Kinky Boots. In addition to its critical success, Matilda had won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding musical and had set a record by winning the most Olivier Awards in history. Nevertheless, Kinky Boots won a season-high six Tonys, including Best Musical, which the press described as an upset, and Lauper's win for Best Score made her the first woman to win alone in that category. The creative team are Americans, and reviewer David Cote, an American writing in The Guardian, judged that the show's win was a case of [...] "the balance of love going to a homegrown American musical, Kinky Boots, over the British import Matilda." [...] The other Tony wins were for best actor (Porter), sound design (Shivers), choreography (Mitchell) and orchestrations (Oremus). [...] Fierstein, Sands, Ashford, Mitchell (as director) and the three other designers were all nominated but did not win. Kinky Boots also won the 2013 Artios Award for Outstanding Achievement in Casting in the Broadway <b>musical</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer's {{performance}} {{continued to}} draw rave reviews from film critics, who hailed {{it as one}} of the decade's most powerful and sexiest. Film critic Roger Ebert predicted that The Fabulous Baker Boys would become [...] "one of the movies they will use as a document... when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star", concluding, [...] "This is the movie of her flowering - not just as a beautiful woman, but as an actress with the ability to make you care about her, to make you feel what she feels." [...] Ebert also identified Pfeiffer as a successor to classic Hollywood actresses Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Pfeiffer won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, her first win and second nomination after having been nominated the previous year for her performance as in Married to the Mob (1988). Some critics questioned why she had not been nominated in the award's Comedy or <b>Musical</b> <b>category</b> instead considering her several musical performances given throughout The Fabulous Baker Boys. Pfeiffer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, her second Academy Award nomination. According to film critic Emanuel Levy, Pfeiffer and fellow nominee Jessica Tandy were considered to be the category's top two contenders due to the lackluster performances delivered by other nominees that year; the competition between Pfeiffer and Tandy was dubbed [...] "Old Hollywood Vs. Young Hollywood" [...] by the media {{as a result of the}} age difference between Pfeiffer (31) and Tandy (80) at the time. Despite being largely favored to win, Pfeiffer ultimately lost the award to Tandy, who won for her performance in Driving Miss Daisy (1989), a result that upset both surprised critics and the general public. Critics believe Tandy won because Academy Award voters felt sentimental towards her age, aided by the fact that her film had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture while The Fabulous Baker Boys was not. Katey Rich of Vanity Fair insists that the award rightfully belonged to Pfeiffer, ranking the spectacle among [...] "10 Times the Golden Globes Got It Right and the Oscars Didn't". Pfeiffer became one of only seven actresses to win Best Actress awards from all four major United States film critics associations – the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, The National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics – for a single performance, as well as the only one of these seven actresses who did not go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for that same performance. According to Stylist, Pfeiffer won nearly every recognized [...] "Best Actress" [...] film award except for the Academy and British Academy Film Awards.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generic model of emergence of <b>musical</b> <b>categories</b> during the listening process. The model {{is based on}} a preprocessing and a categorization module. Preprocessing results in a perceptually plausible representation of music events extracted from audio or symbolic input. The categorization module lets a taxonomy of musical entities emerge according to a cognitively plausible online learning paradigm. We show the advantages of using a conceptual clustering method in the musical domain. The system extracts multi-level hierarchies and can be tuned to clustering at various resolutions. The potential of the model is exemplified by exposing it to three different datasets resulting in <b>musical</b> <b>categories</b> of scales, motives, and harmonies consistent with music theory. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a formal model will be {{presented}} that attempts to organise melodic segments into `significant' <b>musical</b> <b>categories</b> (e. g. motives). Given a segmentation of a melodic surface, the proposed model constructs an appropriate representation for each segment {{in terms of a}} number of attributes (these reflect melodic and rhythmic aspects of the segment at the surface and at various abstract levels) and then a clustering algorithm (the Unscramble algorithm) is applied for the organisation of these segments into `meaningful' categories. The proposed clustering algorithm automatically determines an appropriate number of clusters and also the characteristic (or defining) attributes of each category. As a test case this computational model has been used for obtaining a motivic analysis of Schumann's Trumerei. Keywords: motivic analysis, <b>musical</b> <b>categories,</b> similarity, clustering 1.
