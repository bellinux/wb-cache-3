5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the <b>mechanism</b> of catalase is actually a ping–pong <b>mechanism,</b> a type of <b>mechanism</b> that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F.

5|$|The <b>mechanism</b> of {{proteolysis}} by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through}} a threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This <b>mechanism</b> may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical <b>mechanism</b> that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common <b>mechanism,</b> they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E

40|$|When {{we apply}} the <b>mechanisms</b> of an {{object-oriented}} language we form concrete architectures over some domain. Over time we identify recurring patterns and transform the concrete architectures into more general architectural ab-stractions. Such abstractions are then used {{in combination with}} the language <b>mechanisms</b> to form other kinds of con-crete architectures in diagrams and programs: we apply a combination of language <b>mechanisms</b> and architectural abstractions in the modeling and programming process. Our knowledge concerning the needs and possibilities in the modeling process, especially those captured in the architectural abstractions, enables us to invent new lan-guage <b>mechanisms,</b> typically abstraction <b>mechanisms.</b> Such abstraction <b>mechanisms</b> replace several architectural ab-stractions because of the generality of the <b>mechanisms,</b> and because of their integration with other <b>mechanisms</b> of the language: we invent abstraction <b>mechanisms</b> to replace ar-chitectural abstractions.
