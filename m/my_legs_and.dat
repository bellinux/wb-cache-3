It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordeeva and Grinkov won {{almost every}} {{competition}} they entered. In the 31 competitions whose results are {{known at the}} senior and professional levels, they finished first 24 times, and never lower than second {{from the time they}} won their first senior world title. They {{are one of the few}} pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition. [...] They landed the difficult element with ease at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the element at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov's boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating), they were disqualified from that event. They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, [...] making the added physical stress unnecessary. [...] Katia states in her book, [...] "My Sergei: A Love Story" [...] that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team's Doctors: [...] "That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist, in which Sergei threw me in the air, I did a split, then closed <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> made four turns before he caught me. We were the only pair to do this quadruple element, and it was very exhausting—more exhausting than difficult, really. Soviet doctors had measured my pulse rate as exceeding two hundred beats per minute when I did it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's a nasty rip on <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> arm feels mighty sore, but that's all the damage. Seems to me I haven't much to {{complain}} of, considering how far I fell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{she wanted}} to know about the accident, and I told her how you druv up and screwed that thing around <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> backed the train down. She was a good deal took with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{it stands}} to reason,' said the Model. 'Work another week at <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> it'll be the same thing. You'll make 'em out as knotty and as knobby, at last, as if they was the trunks of two old trees. Then, take and stick <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> throat on to another man's body, and you'll make a reg'lar monster. And that's the way the public gets their reg'lar monsters, every first Monday in May, when the Royal Academy Exhibition opens.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I wont," [...] I spluttered, still {{striking}} out with <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> one arm. [...] "Take hold of this, {{and we can}} all go in together." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I meditated taking to <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> running my chances, but this idea was knocked {{in the head}} by Farmer Decker {{grasping}} me by the collar.|$|E
60|$|I leaped up, {{sending an}} agonising shoot of pain through <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> hastened to meet her. Dumps, as if jealous of me, sprang wildly on before, and danced round his {{mistress}} in {{a whirlwind of}} delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm {{not saying}} he did,' Mr. Crow snapped out short as pie crust. 'He took hold of <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't get here without him, and that's why the miserable {{creature}} is making so much trouble.' ...|$|R

60|$|To return: {{the sound}} of the shot, like that of John Peel's horn, aroused Hans from his sleep. He thrust his head between <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> saw Komba fall.|$|E
60|$|But, {{passing along}} a narrow path through {{a clump of}} cottonwoods, some object brushed against <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> I {{stumbled}} and nearly fell. I looked with sudden anxiety at Paul.|$|E
60|$|I {{was not so}} sure of that. I had leisure to {{entertain}} the retort in my mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms, to my face.|$|E
50|$|Aspirated and ejective consonants form phonemic contrasts: kok, kok, and kok {{all have}} {{different}} meanings: (<b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>my</b> tongue, <b>and</b> fire, respectively).|$|R
6000|$|... "'He {{sprang up}} from the ground somewhere as I was leaving the outpost,' he said. 'I believe he was making for it, for he walked blindly into my horse. He got hold of <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> of course none of our chaps dared touch him then.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ain't that right?" [...] said Mrs. Widdup. [...] "The air's real warm. And there's bock-beer {{signs on}} every corner. And the park's all yaller and pink and blue with flowers; and I have such {{shooting}} pains up <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> body." ...|$|E
60|$|I presume Mrs. Keeley will do Ruth Pinch. If so, I {{feel secure}} about her, and of Mrs. Gamp I am certain. But a queer {{sensation}} begins in <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> comes upward to my forehead, when I think of Tom.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. I {{may as well}} walk to {{the house}} and stretch <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> calm my nerves a little. [Looking at his watch] I suppose you know that we have come from Hyde Park Corner to Richmond in twenty-one minutes.|$|E

6000|$|... "I should {{much prefer}} that she should, for then I {{could get up}} on <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> answer her off the reel."

60|$|It was, as I {{remember}} it, a lard pail, {{very wide}} across the top, {{and without a}} cover. As I toddled along, the beer slopped over the rim upon <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> <b>And</b> as I toddled, I pondered. Beer was a very precious thing. Come to think of it, it must be wonderfully good. Else why was I never permitted to drink {{of it in the}} house? Other things kept from me by the grown-ups I had found good. Then this, too, was good. Trust the grown-ups. They knew. And, anyway, the pail was too full. I was slopping it against <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> spilling it on the ground. Why waste it? And no one would know whether I had drunk or spilled it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have felt}} my own," [...] he cried. [...] "I have felt it moving within me, {{so that it}} made me act. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms and brain would not go into action if they were dead, if the spirit {{had gone out of}} them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Hark’ee, Master Bump-ho,” {{said the}} steward; “don’t you fear for Ben, When the watch is called, set me of <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> {{give me the}} {{bearings}} and the distance of where {{you want me to}} steer, and I’ll carry sail with the best of you, I will.” ...|$|E
60|$|Wallace's big sorrel plunged {{after him}} and the rolling stones cracked. Suffering as I was by this time, with cramp in <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> torturing pain, I {{had to choose between}} holding my horse in or falling off; so I chose the former and {{accordingly}} got behind.|$|E
6000|$|At this {{my voice}} ran up <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> {{out of my}} mouth. [...] "Thirty shillings a week, half salary for rehearsals.

6000|$|... "Will ye bleed to death, Davy?" [...] she cried, as {{she slipped}} off <b>my</b> <b>legging</b> <b>and</b> {{bent over the}} wound. Her eye {{lighting}} on a gourdful {{of water on the}} puncheon table, she tore a strip from her dress and washed and bound me deftly. The bullet was in the flesh, and gave me no great pain.|$|R
60|$|With {{uncertain}} steps I {{moved to}} a stone a yard or two away and sat down upon it.
