40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ability of {{portfolio}} and foreign direct investment flows to track <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> euro and the yen against the dollar. Net portfolio flows from the euro area into US stocks - possibly reflecting differences in expected productivity growth - track <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> euro against the dollar closely. Net FDI flows, which capture <b>the</b> recent burst <b>in</b> cross-border M&A activity, appear less important <b>in</b> tracking <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> euro-dollar rate, possibly because many M&A transactions consist of share swaps. <b>Movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yen versus the dollar remain more closely tied to conventional variables such as the current account and interest differential.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} an affine model {{that characterizes the}} dynamics of the term structure of interest rates in Mexico. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the relationship between the term structure factors and macroeconomic variables. First, we show that the model fits the data remarkably well. Second, we show that the first factor captures <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> level of the yield curve, while the second factor captures <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slope of the curve. Third, the variance decomposition results show that the level factor accounts for a substantial part of the variance at the long end of the yield curve at all horizons. At short horizons, the slope factor accounts for much of the variance at the short end of the yield curve. Finally, we show that <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> level of the yield curve are associated with <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> long-term inflation expectations, while <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slope of the curve are associated with <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short-term nominal interest rate.
