50|$|Japan Tobacco is the {{successor}} entity to a nationalized tobacco monopoly first {{established by the}} Government of Japan in 1898 to secure tax revenue collections from tobacco leaf sales. In 1904, the government's leaf monopoly was extended to a complete takeover of all tobacco business operations in the nation, including all <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> products such as cigarettes. The ostensible reason {{for the expansion of}} control was to help fund the 1904 - 1905 Russo-Japanese War, but because all foreign tobacco interests in Japan at the time were forcibly evicted under the monopolization scheme, this also protected the domestic tobacco business for over eighty years.|$|E

50|$|These taxes, {{collected}} by public administrations {{or by the}} institutions of the EU, apply to the production and the consumption of goods and of services. These taxes are independent from profits. They include taxes on the products and others taxes on the production. The taxes on the production cover essentially the taxe professionnelle, the taxe foncière and the versement transport (the professional tax, tax land and the payment transport), which apply to the use of labour and the property or the use of land, buildings and other assets used for the sake of production. They are local taxes, so they are not {{collected by}} the central government (see Local taxes). Taxes on consumption traditionally consisted of indirect duties on the consumption and excise duties, applying only on the use of certain products (alcoholic beverages, <b>manufactured,</b> <b>tobacco</b> products and energy products). However, the establishment of the VAT and its generalization have considerably reduced the scope and thus the revenue of these indirect duties and excise duties even if one of them, the tax on petroleum products, is still considerable. The revenue from the excise duties amounted in 2007 to €2.7 bn, without the TIPP.|$|E
50|$|At Weybourne {{the coast}} has an unusually steep shingle beach which was {{regarded}} as vulnerable {{to the threat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588. The village was also a well-used location for smuggling items such as over-proof gin and pressed bales of tobacco. The coast between Sheringham and Weybourne was popular for landing goods because ships could anchor closer to the shore {{than anywhere else in the}} area. There was also a convenient gap in the cliffs through which goods could be easily transported. Local folklore says that the miller at the local windmill would stop the mill's sails in the form of a cross to warn the smugglers that the customs or coastguards were on to them; when the coast was clear he would set the sails going once more. On Weybourne beach there was so little cover for the waiting land party that the men were reputed to bury themselves neck-deep in the shingle until the smuggling vessel appeared on the horizon. This story perhaps stretches credulity, but the fact that it is also told of Suffolk locations adds at least a little weight. In the 1800s, William J. Bolding, the owner of Weybourne water mill and much of the inland areas at Weybourne, reputedly turned a blind eye to goods landed on the beaches bordering his property, and was rewarded with contraband left discreetly on his doorstep. In February 1837, a Lieutenant George Howes and his men from Weybourne intercepted a large gang of armed smugglers at nearby Kelling. Many shots were exchanged and the coastguards recovered five horses with carts carrying 540 gallons of brandy and around 4,000 pounds of <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an historical {{account of the}} consumption of <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> in post-Unification Italy. The main phases of the monopoly are first reviewed. National and regional time series estimates for the years from 1871 to 1913 are then presented. At the national level, the new figures document a long-term reduction in per-capita consumption and a long-term increase in real per-capita spending. Per-capita real spending on tobacco followed rather closely the familiar Kuznets cycle with upper turning points in the mid- 1870 s, 1887, and, at an unprecedented level, in the pre-WWI years. The new estimates provide additional support to the «optimistic view» of the much debated «crisis» of the 1880 s. The longitudinal features of the new regional estimates are also exploited. A standard myopic model of tobacco consumption is considered and tentative estimates of both short and long run income and price elasticities are provided. The paper ends by presenting possible directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|It {{is renowned}} the {{importance}} of trade balance for maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium. So, {{the objective of the}} study was to identify main products in Brazilian agricultural exports from 1989 to 2012 and, secondly, to describe the identified products and formulate questions for future investigations. There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits and meat and edible meat offal must be cited. At second level in terms of frequency in export items there are animal and vegetable fats and oils, cocoa and cocoa preparations, preparations of vegetables and tobacco and <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco.</b> It is also remarkable specific codes of cocoa and cocoa preparations, sugars and sugar confectionery, and fruits, for example.

There is a general concept among the younger generation that chewing tobacco (spit tobacco, smokeless tobacco) is safe or less harmful than smoking, which has led to an increase in tobacco chewing habit. Chewable tobacco is a greater health hazard having 24 - 30 % higher tobacco content. In addition to oral cancer chewing tobacco leads to impaired functions of heart, nerves, brain and altered hormonal activities.

In contrast to value added tax, they are mainly specific taxes, i. e. expressed as a monetary amount per quantity of the product. The most commonly applied excise duties are those on alcoholic beverages, <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> products and energy products (motor fuels and heating fuels, such as petrol and gasoline, electricity, natural gas, coal and coke). The basic principles applicable to all products subject to excise duties have been laid down in Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. Products subject to excise duties are generally produced, and can afterwards be held under duty suspension, in tax warehouses. The establishment and operation of tax warehouses is subject to the authorization of the Member States. They should respect the principles laid down in Commission Recommendation 2000 / 789 /EC of 29 November 2000 setting out guidelines for the authorisation of warehousekeepers under Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC in relation to products subject to excise duty.

40|$|The tobacco health nexus? Health {{messages}} in narghile advertisements In {{many parts of}} the world, cigarettes are not the only form of tobacco smoked. 1 2 In the eastern Mediterranean region, narghile (water pipe) is a more traditional form of tobacco consumption. The Lebanon Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), conducted among schoolchildren in 2005, indicated that 61 % were current users of tobacco and 33. 9 % currently smoked narghile. 3 Research on the narghile smoke constituents suggest it is as harmful—if not more harmful—than cigar-ettes. 4 5 Recently, narghile smoking has become ‘‘big business’’ and a variety of marketing techniques are being used to emphasise the enjoyable facet of smoking while disregarding its detrimental health effects. One interesting marketing technique has been the use of health messages to market narghile products. This makes the narghile look like a healthy behaviour, more acceptable and, thus, more attractive for many people. For example, in one advertisement for locally <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco,</b> the slogan ‘‘untouched by human hands’ ’ was used as an indicator of ‘‘the purity’ ’ of the product. In addition, the product was shown to be manufactured in state-of-the-art machines, indicating a Figure 1 Ad for type of charcoal used to light the narghile.
