40|$|We {{propose a}} catastrophic {{eruption}} model for magnetar's enormous energy release during giant flares, {{in which a}} toroidal and helically twisted flux rope is embedded within a force-free magnetosphere. The flux rope stays in stable equilibrium states initially and evolves quasi-statically. Upon the loss of equilibrium point is reached, the flux rope cannot sustain the stable equilibrium states and erupts catastrophically. During the process, the magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere is rapidly released {{as the result of}} destabilization of global magnetic topology. The magnetospheric energy that could be accumulated is of vital importance for the outbursts of magnetars. We carefully establish the fully open fields and partially open fields for various boundary conditions at the magnetar surface and study the relevant energy thresholds. By investigating the magnetic energy accumulated at the critical catastrophic point, we find {{that it is possible to}} drive fully open eruptions for dipole dominated background fields. Nevertheless, it is hard to generate fully open magnetic eruptions for <b>multipolar</b> background <b>fields.</b> Given the observational importance of the <b>multipolar</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> in the vicinity of the magnetar surface, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility of the alternative eruption approach in <b>multipolar</b> background <b>fields.</b> Fortunately, we find that flux ropes may give rise to partially open eruptions in the <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields,</b> which involve only partial opening up of background fields. The energy release fractions are greater for cases with central-arcaded multipoles than those with central-caved multipoles emerged in background fields. Eruptions would fail only when the centrally-caved multipoles become extremely strong. Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} role of complex <b>multipolar</b> {{magnetic}} <b>fields</b> in determining physical processes near the surface of rotation powered pulsars. We model the actual magnetic field as the sum of global dipolar and star-centered <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields.</b> In configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields,</b> 'neutral points' and 'neutral lines' exist close to the stellar surface. Also, the curvature radii of magnetic field lines near the stellar surface can never be smaller than the stellar radius, even for very high order multipoles. Consequently, such configurations are unable to provide an efficient pair creation process above pulsar polar caps, necessary for plasma mechanisms of generation of pulsar radiation. In configurations involving axially symmetric and non-uniform multipoles, {{the periphery of the}} pulsar polar cap becomes fragmented into symmetrically distributed narrow sub-regions where curvature radii of complex magnetic field lines are less than the radius of the star. The pair production process is only possible just above these 'favourable' sub-regions. As a result, the pair plasma flow is confined within narrow filaments regularly distributed around the margin of the open magnetic flux tube. Such a magnetic topology allows us to model the system of twenty isolated sub-beams observed in PSR B 0943 + 10 by Deshpande & Rankin (1999, 2001). We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission in the ensemble of finite sub-beams, based on specific instabilities. We propose an explanation for the subpulse drift phenomenon observed in some long-period pulsars. Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures, MNRAS, in pres...|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} magnetic Bp star HD 137509 exhibits complex rotational modulation of {{the longitudinal}} field and other magnetic observables. Interpretation of this magnetic {{variability in the}} framework of the low-order <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> models suggests a very strong quadrupolar component to dominate the surface field topology of HD 137509. I have examined the high-quality VLT/UVES spectra of HD 137509 and discovered resolved Zeeman split components in some of the spectral lines. The inferred mean surface field modulus, = 29 kG, agrees with the multipolar model predictions. This confirms the presence of an extremely strong non-dipolar magnetic field in HD 137509 and establishes this star as the object with the second-largest field among magnetic chemically peculiar stars.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel scheme to {{normalize}} scattering modes {{of the electromagnetic}} field. By relying on analytical solutions for Maxwell's equations in the homogenous medium outside the scatterer, we derive normalization conditions that only depend on the electromagnetic field {{on the surface of}} a sphere containing the scatterer. We pay special attention to the important cases of plane wave illumination and illumination with a <b>multipolar</b> <b>field,</b> for which an explicit and easy to use normalization condition is derived. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by normalizing scattering modes of some selected metallic and dielectric scatterers of different geometries in the context of different application scenarios. Since every quantum mechanical treatment of light-matter interaction requires the proper normalization of electromagnetic fields, we deem our proposed normalization scheme broadly applicable independent of the scatterer involved.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field topology {{in the surrounding}} of neutron stars {{is one of the}} key questions in pulsar magnetospheric physics. A very extensive literature exists about the assumption of a dipolar {{magnetic field}} but very little progress has been made in attempts to include multipolar components in a self-consistent way. In this paper, we study the effect of <b>multipolar</b> electromagnetic <b>fields</b> anchored in the star. We give exact analytical solutions in closed form for any order l and apply them to the retarded point quadrupole (l= 2), hexapole (l= 3) and octopole (l= 4), a generalization of the retarded point dipole (l= 1). We also compare the Poynting flux from each multipole and show that the spin down luminosity depends on the ratio R/r_ L, R being the neutron star radius and r_ L the light-cylinder radius. Therefore the braking index also depends on R/r_ L. As such multipole fields possess very different topology, most importantly smaller length scales compared to the dipolar field, especially close to the neutron star, we investigate the deformation of the polar caps induced by these <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields.</b> Such fields could have a strong impact on the interpretation of the pulsed radio emission suspected to emanate from these polar caps as well as on the inferred geometry deduced from the high-energy light-curve fitting and on the magnetic field strength. Discrepancies between the two-pole caustic model and our new multipole-caustic model are emphasized with the quadrupole field. To this respect, we demonstrate that working with only a dipole field can be very misleading. Comment: accepted for publication in MNRAS, references added and typos correcte...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the <b>multipolar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> structure variation at neutron star surface {{by means of}} the catastrophic eruption model, and find that the variation of the geometry of <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields</b> on the magnetar surface could result in the catastrophic rearrangement of the magnetosphere, which provides certain physical mechanism for the outburst of giant flares. The magnetospheric model we adopted consists of two assumptions: a helically twisted flux rope is suspended in an ideal force-free magnetosphere around the magnetar, and a current sheet emerges during the flux rope evolution. Magnetic energy accumulates during the flux rope's gradual evolution along with the variation of magnetar surface magnetic structure before the eruption. The two typical behaviors, either state transition or catastrophic escape, would take place once the flux rope loses equilibrium, thus tremendous accumulated energy is radiated. We have investigated the equilibrium state of the flux rope and the energy release affected by different multipolar structures, and find structures that could trigger violent eruption and provide the radiation approximately 0. 5 % of the total magnetic energy during the giant flare outburst. Our results provide certain multipolar structures of the neutron star's magnetic field with an energy release percentage 0. 42 % in the state transition and 0. 51 % in the catastrophic escape case, which are sufficient for the previously reported energy release from SGR 1806 - 20 giant flares...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Following {{a cursory}} review and {{synthesis}} of multipolar continua, {{the rudiments of}} graph theory, and granular mechanics, a graph-theoretic, energy-based homogenization is proposed for the systematic derivation of multipolar stress and kinematics in granular media. This provides a weakly non-local hierarchy of <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> equations for quasi-static mechanics based on polynomial representations of the kinematics of the type employed in past works. As an improvement on those works, a method is proposed for avoiding ”overfitting ” of fluctuations based on the so-called ”Generalized Additive Method ” of statistics. Among other results, it is shown that the standard formula for Cauchy stress in granular media may break down owing to multipolar effects, and that granular rotations in the typical granular medium should not lead to Cosserat effects, as the lowest-order departure from the simple-continuum model.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of hydration free energies is a sensitive test to assess force fields used in atomistic simulations. We showed {{recently that the}} vibrational relaxation times, 1 D- and 2 D-infrared spectroscopies for CN(-) in water can be quantitatively described from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with <b>multipolar</b> force <b>fields</b> and slightly enlarged van der Waals radii for the C- and N-atoms. To validate such an approach, the present work investigates the solvation free energy of cyanide in water using MD simulations with accurate multipolar electrostatics. It is found that larger van der Waals radii are indeed necessary to obtain results close to the experimental values when a <b>multipolar</b> force <b>field</b> is used. For CN(-), the van der Waals ranges refined in our previous work yield hydration free energy between - 72. 0 and - 77. 2 kcal mol(- 1), which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In addition to the cyanide ion, we also study the hydroxide ion {{to show that the}} method used here is readily applicable to similar systems. Hydration free energies are found to sensitively depend on the intermolecular interactions, while bonded interactions are less important, as expected.

30|$|It is also {{possible}} that compositional dynamos might be run by crystallization elsewhere in the core rather than its center. Breuer et al. (2010), summarizing earlier suggestions (Stevenson 1983), note that saturation of metal in light elements might occur at the lower pressures of a magma ocean that might later exsolve from the metal due to oversaturation at higher pressures after the metal segregates to form the core. Flow of exsolved material upwards in the core could drive a dynamo, which Hirose et al. (2017) show that it is quite efficient and possibly operates the present-day Earth’s. No computationally simulated dynamos have yet been constructed to operate in this regime, though Hori et al. (2012) note that volumetric buoyancy sources, which could characterize exsolution-driven dynamos, yield more <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields</b> and hence less spatial regularity to the field, perhaps mimicking Mars’ surface magnetism. If, however, the Earth’s dynamo operates this way (Hirose et al. 2017), its strong dipolarity contradicts the volumetric source field morphology inference.|$|R

In particular, inspiralling compact binaries are well-modelled by a system of two point-particles moving on a quasi-circular orbit whose decay by emission of gravitational radiation is described by a post-Newtonian expansion. In this paper we summarize the basics of the computation by means of a series of multipole moments of the exterior field generated by an isolated source in the post-Newtonian approximation. This computation relies on an ansatz of matching the exterior <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> to the inner field of a slowly-moving source. The formalism can be applied to point-particles at the price of a further ansatz, that the infinite self-field of point-particles can be regularized in a certain way.

Observations were obtained at the 2. 1 -m Otto Struve Telescope of McDonald Observatory with 3 s and 1 s integration times respectively. In an attempt to understand the observed complex changes in accretion flow geometry observed in BY Cam, we performed full 3 D MHD simulations assuming a variety of white dwarf magnetic field structures.

We compare model predictions with photometry at various phases of the beat cycle and find that synthetic light curves derived from a <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> structure are broadly consistent with optical photometry. FL Ceti is observed to have two very small accretion regions at the foot-points of the white dwarf’s magnetic field.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a methodology for tailoring {{the design of}} metamaterial dielectric resonators, which represent a promising path toward low-loss metamaterials at optical frequencies. We first describe a procedure to decompose the far field scattered by subwavelength resonators in terms of <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> components, providing explicit expressions for the multipolar far fields. We apply this formulation to confirm that an isolated high-permittivity cube resonator possesses frequency separated electric and magnetic dipole resonances, {{as well as a}} magnetic quadrupole resonance in close proximity to the electric dipole resonance. We then introduce multiple dielectric gaps to the resonator geometry in a manner suggested by perturbation theory, and demonstrate the ability to overlap the electric and magnetic dipole resonances, thereby enabling directional scattering by satisfying the first Kerker condition. We further demonstrate the ability to push the quadrupole resonance away from the degenerate dipole resonances to achieve local behavior. These properties are confirmed through the multipolar expansion and show that the use of geometries suggested by perturbation theory is a viable route to achieve purely dipole resonances for metamaterial applications such as wave-front manipulation with Huygens' metasurfaces.

Here, we calculate the ellipticity of a non-barotropic neutron star with (i) a quadrupole poloidal-toroidal field, and (ii) a purely poloidal field containing arbitrary multipoles, deriving {{the relation between the}} ellipticity and the multipole amplitudes. We present, as a worked example, a purely poloidal field comprising dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components. We show the correlation between field energy and ellipticity for each multipole, that the l= 4 multipole has the lowest energy, and that l= 5 has the lowest ellipticity. We show how a mixed <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> creates an observationally testable mismatch between the principal axes of inertia (to be inferred from gravitational wave data) and the magnetic inclination angle. Strong quadrupole and octupole components (with amplitudes ~ 10 ^ 2 times higher than the dipole) in SGR 0418 + 5729 still yield ellipticity ~ 10 ^{- 8 }, consistent with current gravitational wave upper limits.

The low-beta quadrupoles are thus equipped with correct-ing coils up to the dodecapole order. The correction is planned to rely on magnetic measurements. We show that a relatively simple method allows an accurate measurement of the <b>multipolar</b> <b>field</b> aberrations using the beam. The principle is to displace the beam in the non-linear fields by local closed orbit bumps and to measure the variation of sensitive beam observables. The resolution and robustness of the method are found appropriate. Experimentation at RHIC showed clearly the presence of normal and skew sex-tupolar field components in addition to a skew quadrupolar component in the interaction regions. Higher-order com-ponents up to decapole order appear as well. 1 PRINCIPLE OF THE MEASUREMENT To avoid a strong perturbation of the beam dynamics, the beam is moved locally to large amplitudes using a closed orbit bump. The non-linearity inside the orbit bump acts by feed-down to all lower orders. Its order and magnitude are deduced from the variation of suitable observables with the bump amplitude. This method is extrapolated from [1] where it was used to measure the azimuthal dependence of a parasitic skew gradient in LEP. In this paper, we consider the feed-downs to dipole and quadrupole orders. Measurement of the Orbit Perturbation We select as an observable the rms orbit perturbation measured outside the bump.

40|$|Context: dynamo {{action in}} giant planets and rapidly {{rotating}} stars {{leads to a}} broad variety of magnetic field geometries including small scale multipolar and large scale dipole-dominated topologies. Previous dynamo models suggest that solutions become multipolar once inertia becomes influential. Being tailored for terrestrial planets, most of these models neglected the background density stratification. Aims: we investigate {{the influence of the}} density stratification on convection-driven dynamo models. Methods: three-dimensional nonlinear simulations of rapidly rotating spherical shells are employed using the anelastic approximation to incorporate density stratification. A systematic parametric study for various density stratifications and Rayleigh numbers allows to explore the dependence of the magnetic field topology on these parameters. Results: anelastic dynamo models tend to produce a broad range of magnetic field geometries that fall on two distinct branches with either strong dipole-dominated or weak <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields.</b> As long as inertia is weak, both branches can coexist but the dipolar branch vanishes once inertia becomes influential. The dipolar branch also vanishes for stronger density stratifications. The reason is the concentration of the convective columns in a narrow region close to the outer boundary equator, a configuration that favors non-axisymmetric solutions. In multipolar solutions, zonal flows can become significant and participate in the toroidal field generation. Parker dynamo waves may then play an important role close to onset of dynamo action leading to a cyclic magnetic field behavior. Conclusion: Our simulations also suggest that the fact that late M dwarfs have dipolar or <b>multipolar</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> can be explained in two ways. They may differ either by the relative influence of inertia or fall into the regime where both types of solutions coexist.

The magnetic measurements were performed using 8 cc cubic samples and provided well-defined reverse and normal polarity directions prior and after the last reversal. In three records stepwise demagnetization of the transitional samples revealed a succession of scattered directions instead of a well-defined characteristic component of magnetization. There is no relationship with changes in magnetic mineralogy, magnetic concentration and magnetic grain sizes. This behavior could be caused by weakly magnetized sediment. However the transitional samples of two cores have almost three orders of magnitude stronger magnetizations than the non-transitional samples that yielded unambiguous primary directions {{in the other two}} cores. Moreover a similar proportion of magnetic grains was aligned in all records. Therefore, the large amount of magnetic grains oriented by the weak transitional field did not contribute to improve the definition of the characteristic component. We infer that the weakness of the field might not be only responsible. Assuming that the transitional period is dominated by a <b>multipolar</b> <b>field,</b> {{it is likely that the}} rapidly moving non-dipole components generated different directions that were recorded over the 2 cm stratigraphic thickness of each sample. These components are carried by grains with similar magnetic properties yielding scattered directions during demagnetization. In contrast, the strongly magnetized sediments of the fourth core from the West Equatorial Pacific Ocean were exempt of problems during demagnetization. The declinations rotate smoothly between the two polarities while the inclinations remain close to zero. This scenario results from post-depositional realignment that integrated various amounts of pre- and post-transitional magnetic directions within each sample. The present results point out the impossibility of extracting reliable information on geomagnetic reversals from low-medium deposition rate sediments with the current sampling techniques.

The hollow structure of this molecule is obtained by decorating the vertices of a soccer ball by carbon atoms [3]. This uncommon geometry, reminiscent of a «rolled-up piece of graphite,>, is the origin of unusual properties for the C 60 molecule and other fullerenes with a similar topology.

Then, I will discuss the possibility of collective electronic excitations in response to external electromagnetic fields. At the first glance, the occurrence of collectivity in these excitations may surprise in view of the relatively large gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HO MO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) found in the fuHerenes. I will address the nature of these collective electronic modes and compare them to similar modes found in graphite. Most important, I will discuss the possibility of their excitation by external <b>multipolar</b> electromagnetic <b>fields</b> and inelastic electron scattering. Results-for the static polarizability of C 60 will be summarized in sect. 1, collectivity of dipole excitations in C 60 will be discussed in sect. 2, the dynamic response of C 20, C 60 and C 70 to <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields</b> will be addressed in sect. 3, and the inelastic scattering of electrons from C 60 and C 70 clusters will be summarized in sect. 4.

40|$|The multipolar {{solution}} of the electromagnetic field is useful in light-matter interactions. Here is presented a method to control the superpositions of <b>multipolar</b> electromagnetic <b>fields</b> using paraxial beams. This is applied to orbital angular momentum paraxial modes, which allow us to calculate their total angular momentum. This quantity {{plays an important role}} in the control of electronic transitions in atoms and molecules. The results here can easily be extended to highly focused laser beams. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We present {{reconstruction}} {{methods for}} radial {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) data which were spatially encoded using a pair of orthogonal <b>multipolar</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> for in-plane encoding and parallel imaging. It is shown that a direct method exists in addition to iterative reconstruction. Standard direct projection reconstruction algorithms can be combined with a previously developed direct reconstruction for <b>multipolar</b> encoding <b>fields</b> acquired with Cartesian trajectories. The algorithm is simplified by recasting the reconstruction problem into polar coordinates. In this formulation distortion and aliasing become separate effects. Distortion occurs only along the radial direction and aliasing along the azimuthal direction. Moreover, aliased points are equidistantly distributed in this representation, and, consequently, Cartesian SENSE is directly applicable with highly effective unfolding properties for radio-frequency coils arranged with a radial symmetry. The direct and iterative methods are applied to simulated data to analyze basic properties of the algorithms {{and for the first}} time also measured in vivo data are presented. The results are compared to linear spatial encoding using a radial trajectory and quadrupolar encoding using a Cartesian trajectory. The direct reconstruction gives good results for fully sampled datasets. Undersampled datasets, however, show star-shaped artifacts, which are significantly reduced with the iterative reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Several {{strategies}} for simulating the ultrafast dynamics of molecules induced by interactions with electromagnetic fields are presented. After {{a brief overview}} of the theory of molecule-field interaction, we present several representative examples of quantum, semiclassical, and classical approaches to describe the ultrafast molecular dynamics, including the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method, Bohmian dynamics, local control theory, semiclassical thawed Gaussian approximation, phase averaging, dephasing representation, molecular mechanics with proton transfer, and <b>multipolar</b> force <b>fields.</b> In addition to the general overview, some focus is given to the description of nuclear quantum effects and to the direct dynamics, in which the ab initio energies and forces acting on the nuclei are evaluated on the fly. Several practical applications, performed {{within the framework of the}} Swiss National Center of Competence in Research “Molecular Ultrafast Science and Technology,” are presented: These include Bohmian dynamics description of the collision of H with H 2, local control theory applied to the photoinduced ultrafast intramolecular proton transfer, semiclassical evaluation of vibrationally resolved electronic absorption, emission, photoelectron, and time-resolved stimulated emission spectra, infrared spectroscopy of H-bonding systems, and <b>multipolar</b> force <b>fields</b> applications in the condensed phase...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe early dynamos of Mars and Earth {{probably}} operated {{without an}} inner core being present. They were thus exclusively driven by secular cooling and radiogenic heating which can both be modeled by homogeneously distributed heat sources. Some previous dynamo simulations that explored this driving mode found dipole dominated magnetic fields, while other reported multipolar configurations. Since these models differed {{both in the}} employed outer thermal boundary conditions and {{in the size of}} the inner core, which was still retained for practical reasons, the cause for the variation in field geometry remained unclear. Here we investigate this issue and find that strong dipole dominated fields are preferred for fixed heat flux conditions whereas weaker <b>multipolar</b> <b>fields</b> are typical for fixed temperature conditions. The size of the inner core, on the other hand, proved to be of minor influence. The stronger dipolar fields for fixed heat flux conditions promote larger convective structures. Since the mantle of the terrestrial planets controls the heat flux rather than the temperature at the core-mantle boundary, our results suggest that the early dynamos of Mars and Earth would have produced dipole dominated magnetic fields...|$|R
