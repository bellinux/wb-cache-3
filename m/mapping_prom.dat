40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 87) There {{are several}} methods {{which can be}} used in the design of a digital computer. Each of these approaches has its advantages and its disadvantages. To learn the trade-offs that apply to the bit slice and microprogram methods, a partial build up of a NOVA CPU was done. In the build up, special attention was focused on the sequencing and central of the CPU. The Project Report presents the outcome of the hardware build up and, in particular, it addresses the issues involved in microcode sequencing and decoding. Two methods of sequencing and decoding are presented in detail. One method relies on firmware to do all the sequencing and mode decoding, such as address modes. The other method relies on firmware and the <b>Mapping</b> <b>PROM</b> to do the sequencing and mode decoding. This project Report investigates the implications of both methods on speed and memory requirements for the CPU. Finally, this Project Report presents technology trends, and investigates the potential use of bit slice technology in future systems...|$|E
5000|$|Humphrey’s Loculus series (1999-2001) {{continued}} the artist’s interest in meditative repetition. The Loculus works involved masses of hand-stitched red discs, {{affixed to the}} wall or standing structures by trails of thread. As Ariella Budick noted in Newsday Magazine in 2000, the works had a biological appearance “like an enlargement of clustered cells. (The title refers to the cavities in a plant ovary.)” [...] These clusters drew comparisons both to the biologic imagery of blood clots and spermazoa, and more figuratively to strategic <b>maps</b> and <b>prom</b> corsages. Works from Humphrey’s Loculus series were shown at Kiang Gallery in Atlanta, Dorsky Gallery in New York, the Islip Art Museum in Islip, NY, and were included in Site and Insight at MoMA PS1 in 2003.|$|R
