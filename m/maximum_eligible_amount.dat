Because it has many parts which have little difference in shape and size, it is very easy to make mistake in assembly parts of this component. Due to mass production, it is high time to develop an online inspection system for the aseembly quality.

Under the command of the CCS, the sensor is able to automatically inspect the component’s parts of which are wrong assmbly, reverse assembly and missing assmbly. Also the sensor can send the inspection information to the CCS. Subsequently, the CCS judges the information and dispalys the judgment result in time.

30|$|Since {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, one of the main application areas of remote sensing in agriculture in Europe has been the control of area-based agricultural subsidies given to the farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) [1]. For many years, this activity, also referred to as controls with remote sensing (CwRS), has consisted in checking whether the area and the crop type declared by the farmer are in line with the real situation as identified mainly from satellite remote sensing data. In the early years, when the identification of crop types was very important, both computer aided photo-interpretation methods (CAPI) and automatic classification procedures were involved in CwRS. Recent changes in the CAP decreased the importance of crop-type identification during the control procedure, while increasing the importance of the detection of anomalies related to the compliance with the rules defined as good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). While CwRS covers the control aspect of the CAP management there is another important element: the land parcel identification system (LPIS). The LPIS is the so called reference system for locating and identifying each agricultural parcel in the EU that is declared in the farmers’ annual applications. The LPIS has to be as up to date as possible in order to reflect the real situation on the ground inside the LPIS parcels in terms of the correct quantification of the <b>maximum</b> <b>eligible</b> area in each LPIS parcel. For identification of these parcels, the use of digital geographic information system (GIS) techniques has been compulsory since January 2005, by a legislation change in 2000 [2].|$|R

40|$|The {{child and}} {{dependent}} care tax credit (CDCTC) is a nonrefundable tax credit {{designed to help}} offset the expenses of providing care for {{children under the age}} of 13 or disabled dependents as long as a parent or caretaker is working or searching for work. 1 One-earner couples are not eligible for the credit. Under current law, eligible expenses are limited to the lesser of $ 3, 000 per child (up to a maximum of $ 6, 000) or the earnings of the lesser-earning spouse. The maximum credit is reduced by any tax-free child-care benefits paid by an employer. The credit rate applied to eligible expenses is 35 percent for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $ 15, 000, phasing down to 20 percent for those with AGI greater than $ 43, 000. Thus, in theory, a low-income family could qualify for a maximum $ 2, 100 credit (35 percent of $ 6, 000). The credit is not refundable, however, and families with incomes under $ 15, 000 generally owe little or no income tax. Thus, the theoretical maximum rarely applies in practice. The expansions to the CDCTC enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) expire at the end of 2010. After that, the <b>maximum</b> <b>eligible</b> expenses revert to $ 2, 400 per child (up to a maximum of $ 4, 800) and the highest credit rate falls to 30 percent. Finally, a temporary provision that allowed the use of the CDCTC against both regular tax and AMT liability regardless of tentative AMT expired at the end of 2006. Unless the provision is extended (or the AMT is reformed or repealed) many middle- and upper-middle-income households could lose some or all of the benefits of the CDCTC beginning in 2007.

40|$|The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is {{a spatial}} {{database}} of reference parcels managed by Member States {{in the context}} of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The <b>maximum</b> <b>eligible</b> area is a crucial attribute of reference parcel for the area-based subsidies. An ineligible elements included in the reference parcel creates the non-conformities or anomalies. This database should be up to date with respect to all the elements which are ineligible for subsidies. In order to achieve this objective, Member States renew their entire orthocoverage every 3 to 5 years. In the consequence, the ¿millions¿ of reference parcels boundaries in the LPIS should then be verified by operators through Computer Aided Photo Interpretation. However, fully manual revision (parcel by parcel) is time consuming and expensive, thus an automatic detection of parcels that potentially need to be updated could significantly improve the time efficiency and reduce the cost of the update process. The aim of this thesis was to develop an automated method for detection of nonconformities in the LPIS in order to support a systematic update process. The proposed method uses the data available in the LPIS and considers the actual update needs. In order to understand the essential update needs and to address the challenge correctly, extensive analyses of anomalies in the systems were undertaken. In the survey more than 21 000 parcels in 12 zones located in 11 Member States were examined. In total close to 10 000 anomalies were found. It was stated that, more than 50 % of all the identified anomalies were caused by patches of trees and buildings located in the reference parcels. Therefore the further research work was focused on outline extraction of selected (building and patches of tree) objects. The developed object extraction method in order to detect selected objects takes advantage of fusion of the radiometric image characteristic (NDVI) with the height data (normalised Digital Surface Model). Two approaches were combined: pixel-based - to localise the potential target objects (called object primitives) and object-based - to delineate 5 outlines of buildings and patches of trees. This combination reduced the processing time since the object-based method was applied only on the subsets of the image where the objects are located, instead of applying heavy computation analysis to the entire image scene. On the other hand, the potential candidate localisation gave better class separation due to reduction of class variability between the full image space and small image subsets containing the primitives. In the object-based approach the Mean Shift segmentation algorithm, developed in the field of Computer Vision, was successfully applied to the aerial ortho-imagery in order to partition the image into adjacent regions. To assure the correctness of the segmentation, considered as a key element of object-based analyses, the segmentation parameters were optimized to the characteristic of the target objects. It was demonstrated that using a standard image LPIS dataset as input to the proposed object extraction method, it is possible to automatically detect 96 % of potential nonconformities caused by buildings and 100 % caused by patches of trees. The UltraCamD image data were found suitable for the automated image analyses and capable of serving as a source for the Digital Surface Model generation using the commercial off-the-shelf software in the agricultural environment. In line with the objectives of the thesis, to reach the automated solution for detection of object causing the LPIS non-conformities, the proposed method of object extraction was implemented in the IDL programming environment.
