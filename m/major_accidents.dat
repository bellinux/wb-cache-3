5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag {{involved}} the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E

Two defendants, Total UK and British Pipeline Agency Limited, had already pleaded guilty to offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The remaining three, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd, and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty in June 2010. TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty of failing to protect their employees.

5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended the memorial service, and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next of kin on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> The conclusion was that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
5|$|There {{were a few}} <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> in {{the history}} of the MRT that raised safety {{concerns}} among the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil spillage on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)—from a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, {{to the extent that}} the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> popularized a punk {{style of}} dress {{based on the}} costumes worn in the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, {{including}} bowler hats, white shirts, white trousers and black boots. Fans of the group, and sometimes members of <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> themselves, also occasionally wore fishtail coats, though more often they wore black leather biker jackets. The [...] "clockwork punk" [...] style also extended to an appreciation of Ludwig van Beethoven's music, again following the movie's protagonist. <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> played the composer's 9th Symphony with guitar, bass and drums in their interpretations The Glorious 9th and The March. Little evidence of any further interest in classical music was shown from the band.|$|R
5|$|The Lions {{explosion}} {{becomes one}} of the <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> in spaceflight history and sets Japan's spaceflight program back by over a decade. In the years following the accident, the public accuses those involved with the Lion program of negligence. Rumors also begin to circulate about the offshore outsourcing of the rocket's production despite the government's claims that it was developed domestically. To promote recovery from the tragedy, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology establishes the Tokyo National Space School in 2014 as a vocational high school dedicated to training {{a new generation of}} students in the space sciences. Japan's spaceflight program is finally reactivated ten years later with the admission of students into the academy's astronaut training program. In the same year, the last operating module of the International Space Station is retired and destroyed by atmospheric reentry following completion of the station's long-term mission. Subsequent development projects are to be completed by individual countries with active spaceflight programs. Of the students in the inaugural class of the astronaut training program, one is selected to join the crew of Japan's second manned mission in 2027. It is the final mission toward completing a space-based solar power satellite.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} been the site of several <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> {{involving}} locomotives. In 1843, the Sloatsburg station {{was the site of}} a large accident by train full of milk bottles. On December 31, 1855, the railroad's Cincinnati Express was thrown off the tracks near the Sloatsburg station, when it tried to avoid a countrymen and his four mules, who were crossing the tracks. Three of the mules were killed and mutilated by the train, while the fourth died soon after. There was no damage to the cars or injuries to the passengers. In the early days of August 1856, a girl by the name of McGraff was injured by an oncoming train near the station after carelessly walking onto the tracks. The parents, who were in a poor state financially, was given $45 (1856 USD) in return for their troubles from the Board of Directors in nearby Goshen. On February 21, 1858, a train heading southbound experienced an accident when a brakeman, John Freeland, fell off the train and was run over. Freeland's legs were severed in the incident, and one arm was broken. They hurried Freeland southbound on a nearby train, but died by the time the train reached Paterson, New Jersey towards the hospital.|$|E

30|$|The {{thresholds}} {{and criteria}} in the ordinance on <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> prevention [1] {{are based on}} the mass of the compound. Due to the small diameter of ENM, it is questioned if the approach of using a mass basis is adequate for ENM or if the particle number or specific surface area should to be taken instead. However, we consider a mass-based approach for ENM within <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> prevention regulation reasonable because data from (eco)toxicological studies are mainly mass-based. However, indispensable is in any case a clear definition of what an ENM and the proposition for a definition by the EU [74] clearly also influences the <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> regulation as this definition also covers natural and incidental nanomaterials and not only ENM [75, 76].|$|R

25|$|The F-100A officially entered USAF {{service on}} 27 September 1954, with the 479th Fighter Wing at George AFB, California. By 10 November 1954, the F-100As {{suffered}} six <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> due to flight instability, structural failures, and hydraulic system failures, prompting {{the air force}} to ground the entire fleet until February 1955. The 479th finally became operational in September 1955. Due to ongoing problems, the air force began phasing out the F-100A in 1958, with the last aircraft leaving active duty in 1961. By that time, 47 aircraft had been lost in <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> Escalating tension due to construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 forced the USAF to recall the F-100As into active service in early 1962. The aircraft was finally retired in 1970.|$|E
