5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members <b>met</b> <b>that</b> goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had <b>met</b> <b>that</b> {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|Since 1904, {{after the}} District had {{notified}} the <b>Met</b> <b>that</b> {{it would not}} use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although it paid the £2,000 a year that was due under the enabling Act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised <b>met</b> <b>that</b> goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient {{for us to have}} them altogether where we <b>met,</b> <b>that</b> upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E
25|$|The Korematsu {{decision}} {{has not been}} explicitly overturned, but in 2011, the Department of Justice filed an official notice conceding that the Solicitor General's defense of the internment policy at the time had been in error.

Also, it was {{one of only a handful}} of cases in which the Court held that the government had <b>met</b> <b>that</b> standard.|$|E

25|$|As agreed by all 11 conferences, {{the results}} of the 2004-07 regular seasons were {{evaluated}} to determine which conferences earned automatic qualification for the BCS games that concluded 2008-11 seasons. Three criteria were used: Rank of the highest-ranked team, rank of all conference teams, and number of teams in the top 25. The six conferences which <b>met</b> <b>that</b> standard were the AQ conferences. The 2008-11 seasons were used to determine if another conference achieved automatic qualification, or a conference that had AQ status lost it, for the BCS games that concluded the 2012 and 2013 seasons.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that increasing access to contraception, including birth control pills, can be an effective strategy for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. According to Thomas Wire, contraception is the 'greenest technology' because of its cost-effectiveness in combating global warming — each $7 spent on family planning would reduce global carbon emissions by 1 tonne over four decades, while achieving the same result with low-carbon technologies would require $32. If all the current unmet need for contraception were <b>met,</b> <b>that</b> would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 34 gigatonnes between 2010 and 2050.|$|E
25|$|Kara has {{no memory}} of the {{destruction}} of Krypton, and believes it is only three days since her spacecraft was launched. She learns the truth about Krypton's destruction from Superman, and later journeys through a wormhole to Argo City, which she finds in orbit around a blue sun. She finds the city in ruins, with no explanation of how it <b>met</b> <b>that</b> fate, and is attacked by a female Worldkiller named Reign before the city plummets into the sun. When Reign and her fellow Worldkiller plan to enslave the Earth, Supergirl returns there to defeat them, and thus adopts Earth as her new home.|$|E
25|$|Just {{days after}} {{securing}} {{a place in}} the Play-offs, with a 74–65 win at home against the Milton Keynes Lions, club Managing Director Alan McClafferty announced that coach Paul James would not have his contract renewed {{at the end of the}} season. The Heat finished the regular season in 4th place with a 21-12 record, qualifying for the Play-off Quarter-final with home court advantage. Drawn against the Plymouth Raiders, which marked the eighth time the two teams had <b>met</b> <b>that</b> season, the Heat suffered a disappointing end to the season, going down 81-89. A lone high-note was that American Keonta Howell was voted into the BBL All-Star first team after coming 3rd in the voting for the MVP award.|$|E

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on connecting lines to reach Midwestern cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors. Stone was first {{appointed to the}} board in 1867, and probably served until December 1868. In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and refined oil being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller knew he could get his oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men <b>met</b> <b>that</b> evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E
25|$|During his Presidency, Narayanan {{dissolved}} the Lok Sabha twice after determining through consultations {{across the}} political spectrum, {{that no one was}} in a position to secure the confidence of the house. Congress president Sitaram Kesri withdrew his party's support of the I. K. Gujral government and staked his claim to form the government on 28 November 1997. Gujral advised Narayanan of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. President Narayanan determined that no one would be able to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha and accepted Gujral's advice (4 December). In the ensuing general elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party, leading the largest pre-election coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the coalition leader Vajpayee staked his claim to form the government, though at that point he did not have a majority. Narayanan asked Vajpayee to furnish letters of support to demonstrate the NDA's ability to secure a majority. Vajpayee was able to meet this demand after support for the NDA grew, and subsequently he was appointed Prime Minister (15 March 1998) on the condition (which was <b>met)</b> <b>that</b> a vote of confidence be secured within 10 days.|$|E
25|$|MD 117's partial {{interchange}} with I-270 {{was constructed}} in 1987; to that point, MD 117's access to I-270 had been indirect via the Interstate's interchange with Quince Orchard Road, which had been built as a county highway concurrent with the freeway in 1956. MD 117 was expanded to a divided highway from west of MD 118 to MD 119 in Germantown and {{on either side of}} its intersection with MD 124 in Gaithersburg by 1999. Since at least 1950, West Diamond Avenue had passed under MD 355's bridge across the railroad and <b>met</b> <b>that</b> highway at an oblique intersection. In 1987, MD 355's bridge was replaced with the present bridge and the oblique intersection was replaced with a more gentle curve and right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355. In 1991, access to southbound MD 355 was added via what is now MD 117A. In 2003, the right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355 was removed. Old Towne Road was built as an extension of West Diamond Avenue to Summit Avenue in downtown Gaithersburg. Northbound MD 355 connected with this extension via Fulks Corner Avenue. The piece of MD 117 from the removed ramps to Fulks Corner Road became a short, municipally maintained extension of MD 117. In 2012, MD 117 was truncated at the intersection with MD 117A west of the MD 355 overpass.|$|E
