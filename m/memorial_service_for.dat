5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> <b>for</b> the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> <b>for</b> Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

5|$|In June 2006, erosion {{resulting}} from heavy rains exposed human remains near the westbound lanes of Route 37 in Cranston. Subsequent drainage {{improvements to the}} freeway led {{to the discovery of}} human remains from more than 70 individuals buried in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Archaeological research indicated that the portion of Route 37 in Cranston between Exits 2 and 3 was inadvertently constructed over a portion of the State Farm Cemetery in the 1960s. The cemetery's wooden burial markers had deteriorated by the time Route 37 was constructed, and environmental studies that would have indicated the location of the cemetery were not conducted prior to the expressway's construction. In late 2006, the remains of 71 individuals were exhumed from the site of the previous cemetery and re-interred at the State Institution Cemetery in Warwick. On July 14, 2009, RIDOT hosted a <b>memorial</b> <b>service</b> <b>for</b> the 71 people re-interred in Warwick.|$|E
