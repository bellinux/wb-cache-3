2500|$|The Court {{stated that}} even for {{preserved}} errors, only those that structurally [...] "undermine {{the fairness of}} a criminal proceeding as a whole" [...] require reversal without {{a consideration of the}} effect the error had on the proceeding. [...] The omission of a Rule 11 warning alone does not fall into this category. [...] Furthermore, the Rule 52 phrase [...] "error that affects substantial rights," [...] which is used in Rule 52, [...] "has previously been taken to <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding." [...] The Court concluded by holding that [...] "a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea." [...] The Court explained that a reasonable probability is one that is [...] "sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome" [...] of the proceeding.|$|E
2500|$|... in 158 B. C. E. Hipparchus {{computed}} a very erroneous {{summer solstice}} from Callippus's calendar. He observed the summer solstice in 146 and 135 both [...] {{to a few}} hours, but observations of the moment of equinox were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime. Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work {{on the length of}} the year in the Almagest III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162–128. [...] of Hipparchus's seventeen equinox observations made at Rhodes shows that the <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> in declination is positive seven arc minutes, nearly agreeing with the sum of refraction by air and Swerdlow's parallax. The random noise is two arc minutes or more nearly one arcminute if rounding is taken into account which approximately agrees with the sharpness of the eye. Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146 at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on Alexandria's large public equatorial ring that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude). He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the equator, so if he were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument. The problem with an equatorial ring (if an observer is naive enough to trust it very near dawn or dusk) is that atmospheric refraction lifts the Sun significantly above the horizon: so for a northern hemisphere observer its apparent declination is too high, which changes the observed time when the Sun crosses the equator. (Worse, the refraction decreases as the Sun rises and increases as it sets, so it may appear to move in the wrong direction with respect to the equator in the course of the ...|$|E
60|$|At {{elevations}} below 4000 feet, elevations {{calculated from}} the boiling-point {{are not to be}} depended on; and Dr. Thomson remarked the same in north-west India: above 17,000 feet also the observations are hazardous, except good shelter and a very steady fire is obtainable, owing to the heating of the metal above that of the water. At all other elevations a <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> of 100 feet is on the average what is to be expected in ordinary cases. For the elevation of great mountain masses, and continuously elevated areas, I conceive that the results are as good as barometrical ones; for the general purposes of botanical geography, the boiling-point thermometer supersedes the barometer in point of practical utility, for under every advantage, the transport of a glass tube full of mercury, nearly three feet long, and cased in metal, is a great drawback to the unrestrained motion of the traveller.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a monthly}} time series of {{charcoal}} prices in Minas Gerais from January 2000 to September 2014, this study aimed {{to evaluate the}} use of neuro-fuzzy system to model the series and forecasting prices. We used four modeling structures for different prices lags (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 lags). The structure most appropriate for neuro-fuzzy system was chosen based on the root <b>mean</b> square <b>error,</b> <b>mean</b> absolute <b>error,</b> <b>mean</b> squared <b>error,</b> <b>mean</b> absolute percentage <b>error</b> and maximum absolute percentage error for the forecasted period.

50|$|During September and October 1960, {{the first}} 130 {{photographic}} plates were taken, with each plate spanning 35.6 × 35.6 cm {{and having a}} limiting magnitude of 20.5. The observed region covered an area of 36° × 18°. The Zeiss blink comparator from the Heidelberg Observatory was adapted to perform blink comparison of the plates. This resulted in {{the discovery of a}} large number of asteroids; typically 200-400 per plate. A subset of these objects had sufficient data to allow orbital elements to be computed. The <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> in their positions was as small as 0.6&Prime;, which corresponded to 0.009 mm on the plates. The resulting <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> in magnitude estimation was 0.19.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{forecasting}} performances of several non-linear models, namely GARCH, EGARCH, APARCH used with three distributions, namely the Gaussian normal, the Student-t and Generalized Error Distribution (GED).

Our result show that the asymmetric GARCH family models are generally the best for forecasting NICs indices. We also find that both Root <b>Mean</b> Squared <b>Error</b> and <b>Mean</b> Absolute <b>Error</b> forecast statistic measures tend to choose models that were estimated assuming the normal distribution, while the other two remaining forecast measures privilege models with t-student and GED distribution. ...|$|R

50|$|The Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{applications}} of the large sieve method. It improves Dirichlet's theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved generalized Riemann hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{finite element}} method was {{designed}} to deal with problem with complicated computational regions. The PDE is first recast into a variational form which essentially forces the <b>mean</b> <b>error</b> to be small everywhere. The discretization step proceeds by dividing the computational domain into elements of triangular or rectangular shape. The solution within each element is interpolated with a polynomial of usually low order. Again, the unknowns are the solution at the collocation points. The CFD community adopted the FEM in the 1980s when reliable methods for dealing with advection dominated problems were devised.|$|E

The conclusion was critical of the moving graticule of the G.G.S., which could be obscured by the target. Compared to the EZ 42, the Allied sight's prediction angle was found on average to be 20% less accurate, and vary by 1% per degree.

Maximum range was 2 km better than the 76 mm M1942 at 15.3 km. Weight increased by 650 kg over the M-30, to 3,150 kg; the D-30 is over twice the weight of the 76mm M1942.
