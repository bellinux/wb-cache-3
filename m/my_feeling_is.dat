500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
500|$|The Weinstein Company also heavily recast {{the film}} with bigger-name {{actors in the}} hopes of {{attracting}} a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much-smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy, and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed {{a large part of the}} film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however, saying, [...] "At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is,</b> you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities– give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot." [...] Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 September 1938, {{just before}} the Munich crisis, Churchill wrote an oft-repeated comment {{in a letter to}} Moyne: [...] "Owing to the neglect of our defences and the {{mishandling}} of the German problem in the last five years, we seem to be very near the bleak choice between War and Shame. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that we shall choose Shame, and then have War thrown in a little later, on even more adverse terms than at present." ...|$|E
2500|$|People in the {{community}} seem to take pride in Teaneck's high rate of Aliyah to Israel. It's certainly something to be proud of. But we make {{no mention of the}} equally high rates (maybe even higher rates) of [...] "yerida" [...] from Israel to Teaneck. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> these 'yordim' should not be accorded honors in our synagogues or schools. These people are the antithesis of what we want to teach our children, of how we want to live. For most religious Zionists, of which Teaneck has more than a few, the goal is to end up in Israel. Having [...] "yordim" [...] as community leaders here is bad public policy. Recently, one of the largest synagogues in town installed a [...] "yored" [...] as its president. Our schools honor [...] "yordim" [...] on a regular basis at their dinners. [...] "Yordim" [...] make up a large percentage of our school's Hebrew teachers.|$|E

60|$|But when, {{instead of}} such evidence, nothing is {{produced}} but {{two sets of}} discrepant stories, originating nobody knows how or when, among persons who could believe as firmly in devils which enter pigs, I confess that <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> one of astonishment that any one should expect a reasonable man to take such testimony seriously.|$|E
6000|$|He wrote a {{brief reply}} to Gillingham. [...] "I know I am entirely wrong, but I don't agree with you. As to her having lived with and had three {{children}} by him, <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> (though I can advance no logical or moral defence of it, on the old lines) that it has done little more than finish her education. I shall write to her, and learn whether what that woman said is true or no." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} of anything," [...] said Lopez,--"except this, that I {{do not mean to}} ask a single {{question}} about it. If he says nothing to me about money, I certainly shall say nothing to him. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> this, Duchess; I am not marrying Miss Wharton for her money. The money, if there be any, has {{had nothing to do with}} it. But of course it will be a pleasure added if it be there." [...] The Duchess complimented him, and told him that this was exactly as it should be.|$|E

6000|$|... "But it must {{be evident}} to you, sir, that a high-spirited gentleman like Mr. March--I confess that <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> with him very warmly in the matter--could not submit to {{dictation}} of the nature you describe." ...|$|R

60|$|Another {{less obvious}} cause of <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that {{the love of}} our kind cannot exist, or at all events not unmixed with {{contempt}} and various other unpleasant ingredients, in people who live and have their being amidst thousands and millions of their fellow-creatures herded together. The great thoroughfares in which we walk are peopled with an endless procession, an innumerable multitude; we hardly see and do not look at or notice them, knowing beforehand {{that we do not}} know and never will know them to our dying day; from long use we have almost ceased to regard them as fellow-beings.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder you}} can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln's Inn {{now with a}} shudder of disgust. There are only two {{things in the world}} that make life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you sitting in an office over a ledger, and do you wear a tall hat and an {{umbrella}} and a little black bag? <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that one should look upon life as an adventure, one should burn with the hard, gem-like flame, and one should take risks, one should expose oneself to danger. Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always thought you had talent.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not so}} candid," [...] said Rowland, [...] "as you {{pretend to}} be. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> this. Hudson, as I {{understand}} him, does not need, as an artist, the stimulus of strong emotion, of passion. He's better without it; he's emotional and passionate enough when he 's left to himself. The sooner passion is at rest, therefore, the sooner he will settle down to work, and the fewer emotions he has that are mere emotions and nothing more, the better for him. If you cared for him enough to marry him, I should have nothing to say; I would never venture to interfere. But I strongly suspect you don't, and therefore I would suggest, most respectfully, that you should let him alone." ...|$|E

60|$|Filippo {{turned to}} his sister, on whose pale face I saw it written that she was as {{convinced}} as any there, and <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>were</b> those of a dastard who has broken faith {{with the man who}} trusted him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ask your}} pardon,' said Will stoutly; 'you do not {{understand}} my meaning. As to whether I have ever loved you or not, I must leave that to others. But for one thing, <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> not changed; and for another, you may make it your boast that you have made my whole life and character something {{different from what they}} were. I mean what I say; no less. I do not think getting married is worth while. I would rather you went on living with your father, so that I could walk over and see you once, or maybe twice a week, as people go to church, and then we should both be all the happier between whiles. That's my notion. But I'll marry you if you will,' he added.|$|E
60|$|The 4th {{infantry}} {{went into}} camp at Salubrity {{in the month}} of May, 1844, with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders. At first, officers and men occupied ordinary tents. As the summer heat increased these were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun. The summer was whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visiting those stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away, visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. There was much pleasant intercourse between the inhabitants and the officers of the army. I retain very agreeable recollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintances made there, and no doubt <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> shared by the few officers living who were there at the time. I can call to mind only two officers of the 4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with the regiment, who are now alive.|$|E

"I {{know some}} people get disheartened, and I {{know some people}} want to throw in the sponge and give up, but I can't do that. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> too strong that it's God's will that we live {{together}} in harmony and peace. It's God's will that we grow beyond our racial animosties and that we must commit ourselves to continue that work. That's why I am here. I am not here for any other reason." ...|$|E
5000|$|It frightens me when I {{learn of}} 10,000 people {{treating}} a Star Trek script {{as if it}} were Scripture.
