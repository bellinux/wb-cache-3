5000|$|Though laser <b>myringotomies</b> {{maintain}} patency {{slightly longer}} than cold-knife <b>myringotomies</b> (two {{to three weeks}} for laser and {{two to three days}} for cold knife without tube insertion), they have not proven to be more effective in the management of effusion. One randomized controlled study found that laser <b>myringotomies</b> are safe but less effective than ventilation tube in the treatment of chronic OME. [...] Multiple occurrences in children, a strong history of allergies in children, the presence of thick mucoid effusions, and history of tympanostomy tube insertion in adults, make it likely that laser tympanostomy will be ineffective.|$|R
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for a functioning middle ear is an air-filled middle ear cavity. Aeration {{of the middle}} ear cavity is controlled by the Eustachian tube. Dysfunction of the Eustachian tube has long been acknowledged as a significant etiological factor in disorders {{of the middle ear}}, especially middle ear effusions. Artificial ventilation of the middle ear through the tympanic membrane has been practised for almost two centuries, but with varying degrees of success. In 1954, Armstrong reintroduced the method of inserting a transmyringeal tympanostomy tube into the ear drum. Since that time this ventilatory device has gained wide popularity and several types of tube have been designed. However, an increasing number of clinical reports have shown treatment with tympanostomy tubes to be followed by complications such as tympanosclerosis, atrophy, persistent perforations and cholesteatomas. In the present thesis, experiments were outlined in which the tympanostomy tube - tympanic membrane interaction was studied and in which tympanostomy tubes were also applied in a well-defined type of otitis media. Furthermore, alternative transmyringeal ventilatory procedures such as <b>myringotomies</b> with a delayed healing time were investigated. The results were evaluated with morphological and microbiological methods. Repeated tympanostomy tube insertions in ears of healthy rats caused a remarkable thickening (about 30 -fold) of the tympanic membrane of the tubulated quadrants, but even the untouched quadrants were affected. The thickened areas were characterized mainly by an increase in dense connective tissue which also contained sclerotic plaques. The structural changes in the tympanic membrane were still present 3 months after the final ventilation episode. Cleavage of the rat soft palate caused an immediate accumulation of effusion material in the tympanic cavity due to disturbance of Eustachian tube function. The fluid turned purulent within one to two weeks. The microbial flora of the middle ear cavity correlated well with that of the nasopharynx, indicating an ascending infection. Insertion of a tympanostomy tube could prevent the accumulation of effusion material in the meso- and hypotympanon and significantly suppress bacterial growth in the middle ear cavity. Thermal energy-inflicted <b>myringotomies</b> were tested as an alternative method for establishing transmyringeal ventilation. <b>Myringotomies</b> performed either with a CCL-laser or by diathermy showed a delayed healing pattern, most probably due to widespread destruction of the outer keratinized squamous epithelium and damage to the vascular supply. Upon comparison, laser <b>myringotomies</b> appeared more favourable due to their longer closure times, whereas the perforations accomplished by diathermy were often complicated by otorrhea and showed more advanced structural changes.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV) {{was introduced}} in 2000. The first 7 -valent vaccine {{was followed by a}} 13 -valent vaccine (PCV 13) with the same conjugate, and a 10 -valent vaccine (PCV 10), conjugated to protein D from H. influenzae. The vaccines offer some protection against pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM), and, with PCV 10, possibly also some protection against H. influenzae AOM. PCV 7 {{was introduced in}} Sweden in 2009, but from 2010, Swedish counties were free to use either PCV 13 or PCV 10. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the incidence of AOM-related diagnoses and surgical procedures before and after the introduction of PCV in Sweden, but also to compare the areas using PCV 13 and PCV 10. METHODS:: Data showing the number of AOM diagnoses, ventilation tube insertions, <b>myringotomies,</b> acute mastoiditis cases and mastoidectomies between 2005 and 2014 were extracted from the National Board of Health and Welfare database. Yearly national incidences were calculated, and areas using PCV 13 and PCV 10 were compared. RESULTS:: AOM incidence decreased, both in out-patients (39 %) and hospital admissions (42 %). Ventilation tube insertions decreased by 18 %, and <b>myringotomies</b> by 15 %. The decline in out-patient AOM and ventilation tube insertions was more pronounced in areas that used PCV 10, but geographical differences were large also before vaccine introduction. CONCLUSION:: Otitis media-related diagnoses have decreased in Sweden since the introduction of PCV. Though some decreases were more pronounced in areas where PCV 10 were used, figures should be interpreted with great caution, since considerable geographical differences were obvious also before vaccine introduction...|$|R

5000|$|Otitis {{media or}} middle ear {{infection}} involves the middle ear.

5000|$|In 1649, Jean Riolan the Younger accidentally pierced a patient's ear drum while {{cleaning}} {{it with an}} ear spoon. Surprisingly, the patient's hearing improved. There {{are also}} reports from the 17th and 18th centuries describing separate experiments exploring {{the function of the}} ear drum. [...] In particular, the animal experiments of Thomas Willis were expanded upon by Sir Astley Cooper, who presented two papers to the Royal Society in 1801 on his observations that <b>myringotomy</b> could improve hearing. First, he showed that two patients with perforations of both eardrums could hear perfectly well, despite conventional wisdom that this would result in deafness. Second, he demonstrated that deafness caused by obstruction of the Eustachian tube could be relieved by <b>myringotomy,</b> which equalized the pressure {{on each side of the}} tympanic membrane.|$|E
5000|$|Tympanostomy tube, {{also known}} as a grommet or <b>myringotomy</b> tube, is a small tube {{inserted}} into the eardrum {{in order to keep the}} middle ear aerated for a prolonged period of time, and to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear. The operation to insert the tube involves a <b>myringotomy</b> and is performed under local or general anesthesia. The tube itself is made in a variety of designs. The most commonly used type is shaped like a grommet. When it is necessary to keep the middle ear ventilated for a very long period, a [...] "T"-shaped tube may be used, as these [...] "T-tubes" [...] can stay in place for 2-4 years. Materials used to construct the tube are most often plastics such as silicone or Teflon. Stainless steel tubes exist, but are no longer in frequent use.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} of fluid in an infected middle ear onto the eardrum may {{cause it to}} rupture. Usually this consists of a small hole (perforation), which allows fluid to drain out. If this does not occur naturally, a <b>myringotomy</b> (tympanotomy, tympanostomy) can be performed. A <b>myringotomy</b> is a surgical procedure in which a tiny incision is created in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid, or to drain pus from the middle ear. The fluid or pus comes from a middle ear infection (otitis media), which is a common problem in children. A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously {{in two to three}} weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure.|$|E
50|$|In {{severe cases}} of {{childhood}} inner ear infections and Eustachian tube blockage, ventilation {{can be provided}} by a surgical puncturing of the eardrum to permit air equalization, known as <b>myringotomy.</b> The eardrum would normally naturally heal and close the hole, so a tiny plastic rimmed grommet is inserted into the hole to hold it open. This {{is known as a}} tympanostomy tube. As a child grows, the tube is eventually naturally expelled by the body. Longer-lasting vent grommets with larger flanges have been researched, but these can lead to permanent perforation of the eardrum.|$|E

50|$|Persons with Pierre Robin {{sequence}} (PRS) are {{at greater}} risk for hearing impairment than persons with cleft lip and/or palate without PRS. One study showed an average of 83% hearing loss in PRS, compared to 60% in cleft individuals without PRS (Handzic et al., 1995). Similarly, PRS individuals typically exhibit conductive, bilateral hearing losses that are greater in degree than in cleft individuals without PRS. Middle ear effusion is generally apparent, with no middle ear or inner ear malformations. Accordingly, management by ear tubes (<b>myringotomy</b> tubes) is often effective and may restore normal levels of hearing (Handzic et al., 1995).|$|E
5000|$|The words <b>myringotomy,</b> tympanotomy, tympanostomy, and tympanocentesis {{overlap in}} meaning. The first two are always synonymous, {{and the third}} is often used synonymously.

Sometimes a {{distinction}} is drawn between myringotomy/tympanotomy and tympanostomy, in parallel with the general distinction between an -otomy (cutting) and an [...] (creating a stoma with some degree of permanence or semipermanence). In this distinction, only a tympanostomy involves tympanostomy tubes and creates a semipermanent stoma. This distinction in usage is not always made.

50|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} DOCK8 immunodefiency include recurrent infections, allergies, and malignancies. Nearly all patients have recurrent or chronic {{upper and lower}} respiratory tract infections, with many requiring sinus surgery and <b>myringotomy</b> tube placement. Recurrent lung infections may lead to bronchiectasis or damage to the airways leaving them widened and scarred. The cutaneous or skin infections are distinctive and include severe and difficult to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, and molluscum contagiosum; bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus; as well as fungal infections of the mouth or skin with Candida. Eczema is common, and can be quite severe and further complicated by bacterial infection. Together, these skin infections can become disfiguring.|$|E
50|$|Otitis {{media is}} an {{infection}} in the middle ear, which can spread to the facial nerve and inflame it, causing compression of the nerve in its canal. Antibiotics are used to control the otitis media, and other options include a wide <b>myringotomy</b> (an incision in the tympanic membrane) or decompression if the patient does not improve. Chronic otitis media usually presents in an ear with chronic discharge (otorrhea), or hearing loss, with or without ear pain (otalgia). Once suspected, there should be immediate surgical exploration {{to determine if a}} cholesteatoma has formed as this must be removed if present. Inflammation from the middle ear can spread to the canalis facialis of the temporal bone - through this canal travels the facial nerve together with the steatoacoustisus nerve. In the case of inflammation the nerve is exposed to edema and subsequent high pressure, resulting in a periferic type palsy.|$|E
50|$|In all {{developed}} countries with up-to-date modern healthcare the primary treatment for mastoiditis is administration of intravenous antibiotics. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, such as ceftriaxone. As culture results become available, treatment can be switched to more specific antibiotics {{directed at the}} eradication of the recovered aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Long-term antibiotics {{may be necessary to}} completely eradicate the infection. If the condition does not quickly improve with antibiotics, surgical procedures may be performed (while continuing the medication). The most common procedure is a <b>myringotomy,</b> a small incision in the tympanic membrane (eardrum), or the insertion of a tympanostomy tube into the eardrum. These serve to drain the pus from the middle ear, helping to treat the infection. The tube is extruded spontaneously after a few weeks to months, and the incision heals naturally. If there are complications, or the mastoiditis does not respond to the above treatments, {{it may be necessary to}} perform a mastoidectomy: a procedure in which a portion of the bone is removed and the infection drained.|$|E
50|$|Many {{affected}} individuals experience {{hearing loss}} and show symptoms of otitis media which demonstrate variable responsiveness to {{the insertion of}} <b>myringotomy</b> tubes or grommets. Some patients have a poor sense of smell, which is believed to accompany high mucus production in the sinuses (although others report normal - or even acute - sensitivity to smell and taste). Clinical progression of the disease is variable, with lung transplantation required in severe cases. Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis. Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to {{reduce the incidence of}} lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically. Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long-term sinus damage (although this has not yet been adequately documented). Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung-disease progression. Although the true incidence of the disease is unknown, it is estimated to be 1 in 32,000, although the actual incidence may be as high as 1 in 15,000.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives：Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} {{has been known}} to require long term medical treatment. When medical treatment fails, <b>myringotomy</b> with or without ventilation tube insertion needs to be performed, but the duration of middle ear ventilation with <b>myringotomy</b> is very limited. The insertion of ventilation tubes may also cause some complications, and may require general anesthesia when performing at a young age. The purpose of this report is to see if <b>myringotomy</b> using CO 2 laser can be used as an effective tool in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. Materials and Methods：We retrospectively studied 66 ears of patients who went through <b>myringotomy</b> using CO 2 laser between March, 1998 and May, 1999. We analyzed <b>myringotomy</b> size, patency time, recurrence and cost effectiveness. Results：The average size of <b>myringotomy</b> was 2. 1 mm in diameter. It remained patent for as long as 1. 9 weeks in average. All <b>myringotomy</b> sites were healed without persistent perforations. Average recurrence rate and time were 27 % and 3. 2 months, respectively. The medical treatment is expensive and needs more frequent follow-ups, but laser treatment is cheaper and requires less frequent follow-ups.

40|$|The {{specific}} aims of this prospective {{survey were}} {{to determine the}} accuracy of traditional diagnostic tools, such as pneumatic otoscopy, otomicroscopy, and tympanometry, and evaluate the usefulness of <b>myringotomy</b> as a diagnostic method; also to determine the significance of <b>myringotomy</b> in treating otitis media with effusion (OME). The status of middle ear of 51 children (85 ears) from November 2002 to February 2003 was examined using pneumatic otoscopy, otomicroscopy, and tympanometry, and the presence/absence of middle ear effusion was confirmed by <b>myringotomy.</b> The otomicroscopy was the most sensitive and specific one among three diagnostic tools.

40|$|SummarySecretory {{otitis media}} (SOM) and {{recurrent}} {{acute otitis media}} (RAOM) may require surgical treatment to proper ventilate the middle ear.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} re-evaluate {{the utility of}} CO 2 laser <b>myringotomy</b> in {{children}} with persistent acute otitis media (PAOM). Methods: From September 2002 to April 2008, 40 children with PAOM received CO 2 laser <b>myringotomy.</b> PAOM was defined as continuing symptoms and signs after systemic antibiotic treatment. Before laser <b>myringotomy,</b> the eardrums were checked under videotelescopy, pure tone audiometry or behavior audiometry and tympanometry. Middle ear effusions were collected using our own designed bottle culture device after laser <b>myringotomy.</b> The patients were followed up at outpatient clinics for 3 months. Cultured middle ear pathogens, healing time of the eardrums, hospital course (for admitted patients), {{and the development of}} middle ear effusions were recorded. Results: Forty children with 53 ears with PAOM were enrolled. Eight patients (20 %) had bilateral disease and underwent bilateral laser <b>myringotomy.</b> The overall culture rate was 28. 3 %, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen. Eight patients (20 %) were admitted for intravenous antibiotics. The average eardrum healing time was 22 days in those with positive cultures, and 16. 4 days in those with negative cultures (p= 0. 125). All eardrums healed in 1 month. The resolution rate was 62. 5 % at 1 month. Patients with bilateral PAOM were prone to have positive middle ear culture (5 / 8) compared with those with unilateral PAOM (8 / 32) (p= 0. 086).

In order to determine wether or not lasers are suitable instruments for <b>myringotomy,</b> we investigated two different IR-laser systems (CO 2 -laser and Er:YAG-laser) in combination with different laser application-systems. The ablation properties and thermic effects of the CO 2 -laser and Er:YAG-laser were examined histologicaly and with electron microscope in a newly developed tympanic membrane model. Since duration of middle-ear ventilation depends {{on the size of}} the <b>myringotomy,</b> the relationship between energy parameters and <b>myringotomy</b> patency may be instrumental in deciding on the optimal duration of aeration of the middle ear in secretory otitis media. Myrigotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.

40|$|Purpose: To {{document}} {{the incidence of}} complications after <b>myringotomy</b> and grommet insertion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The {{focus is on the}} incidence of otorrhea and perforation. The possible risk factors for these conditions and treatment response were studied. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records on 206 ears of 163 patients who suffered from nasopharyngeal carcinoma and underwent <b>myringotomy</b> and grommet insertion in a 7 -year period. The follow-up period ranged from 4 weeks to 78 months (median, 9 months). Results: The overall incidence of otorrhea in these ears was 38 %. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) had a significantly high incidence of postoperative discharge (χ 2 test, P ≤. 0001) compared with other patients who underwent <b>myringotomy</b> and grommet insertion. The mean interval between <b>myringotomy</b> and otorrhea was 19. 8 weeks. Forty-seven per cent of the ears with a discharge developed otorrhea within 1 month. In 42 %, the otorrhea responded to treatment and the ears became dry. After extrusion of the grommet, 29 % of those ears with otorrhea ended with an eardrum perforation, and 24 % of the ears showed recurrent effusion. Conclusions: For patients with NPC who underwent <b>myringotomy,</b> there was a significant risk of otorrhea (49 %) and persistent perforation (29 %), and these complications were difficult to manage. We conclude that <b>myringotomy</b> and grommet insertion should not be routinely offered to NPC patients with middle ear effusion. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
