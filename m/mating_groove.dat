2500|$|In July 2014 {{there was}} an {{uncontained}} failure [...] of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before flight, there was excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator causing the failure. The engine [...] "flex" [...] generated a temperature of over 1,000°C (1,900°F) in materials designed to fail at 540°C (1,000°F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a <b>mating</b> <b>groove</b> in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.|$|E

5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding <b>mating</b> <b>grooves</b> in the receiver, and a locking lever that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the locking lever, and so keeping the breech positively locked. As soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the locking lever does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|R
50|$|Since the Brunswick used a round {{that was}} {{specifically}} designed to be <b>mated</b> with the <b>grooves</b> in the rifle, {{it had to be}} oriented properly in order to be loaded. This made the rifle difficult to load at night, when the grooves could not be seen.|$|R

5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a <b>mating</b> <b>groove</b> in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.|$|E

This paper studies the effect of such grooves on the squeeze load characteristics, and hence on the damping capacity, of bearings. A comparison is given between the damping capacity of bearings with grooved lands and that of bearings with equivalent flat lands to give the same pressure flow characteristics. Different bearing configurations, representing thrust and journal applications, are analysed and discussed. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Better {{precision}} {{at lower}} costs {{is a major}} force in design and manufacturing. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as the demands of many location applications are surpassing the practical performance limit (~ five microns) of low-cost couplings. The absence of a means to meet these requirement has motivated the development of the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC). This thesis covers the theoretical and practical considerations needed to model and design QKCs. In a QKC, one component is equipped with three spherical protrusions while the other contains three corresponding conical grooves. Whereas Kinematic Couplings rely on six points of contact, the six arcs of contact between the <b>mated</b> protrusions and <b>grooves</b> of QKCs result in a weakly over-constrained coupling, thus the name Quasi-Kinematic. QKCs are capable of sub-micron repeatability, permit sealing contact as needed in casting, and can be economically mass produced. The design and application of a QKC is demonstrated via a case study on the location of two engine components. Integration of the QKC has improved coupling precision from 5 to 0. 7 microns. In addition, this QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, 60 % fewer pieces, costs 40 % less per engine, and allows feature placement tolerances which are twice as wide as those of the previous dowel-pin-type coupling. by Martin L.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB <b>mating</b> with the <b>groove</b> of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, the Belgian arms {{manufacturer}} Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired {{sales and}} production {{rights to the}} BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—Kulsprutegevär or [...] "machine rifle") chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is {{a variant of the}} Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt's and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and pistol grip. The m/21 would become one of Sweden's main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel which <b>mates</b> the externally <b>grooved</b> chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by a locking lever. The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel, and renamed the Kg m/21-37. The m/37 remained in service until being replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in second-line use until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.|$|R
