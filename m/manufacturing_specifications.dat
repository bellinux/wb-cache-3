40|$|Abstract. Flexibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} sought-after {{properties}} in modern manufacturing systems. Despite this interest, flexibility remains poorly understood in theory and poorly utilized in practice. One reason for this is the lack of general agreement on how to define flexibility: over 70 terms (types and measures) can be found in the literature. This paper concerns developing a framework and classification scheme for use in defining and classifying the various terms regarding flexibility found in manufacturing. The framework consists of six attributes: level of <b>manufacturing</b> requirements <b>specification,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>specification,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> environment <b>specification,</b> flexibility dimension, flexibility measurement approach, and time frame. A six-field hybrid classification scheme is developed based on this framework. The framework serves as a guide for developing new flexibility terms, whereas the classification scheme provides a mechanism for summarizing the important aspects of and assumptions behind a given term. The approach is demonstrated by using the classification scheme to classify over 50 existing flexibility terms. The results indicate that the classification scheme is an effective tool to aid in understanding different flexibility terms and how they compare to one another. At the same time, the difficulty of the classification exercise indicates the need for a suitable framework when defining such terms.

40|$|Abstract: Process {{capability}} indices, Cp, Cpk, and Cpm, are well-known indices used {{widely in}} the manufacturing industry for measuring process reproduction capability according to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specifications,</b> but limited to cases with single engineering specification. Therefore, for processes where the quality characteristic is the location relative to a specific location, they can not provide an effective measure. In this paper, we propose a process loss index LG to evaluate the process capability for this issue. Based on the index, we provide the corresponding transformation for production yield. In addition, we tabulate some critical values for process loss index LG to judge if the process capability is capable. The proposed method is useful for the practitioners to measure the process loss and determine whether a process meets the present process yield requirement...|$|E
