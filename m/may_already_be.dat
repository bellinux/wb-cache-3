5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the species}} once {{inhabited}} rainforests, swamps, and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in Sichuan. They are now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra and one on Borneo. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt, {{and one of the}} Sumatran populations <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from the northern part of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia); however, a tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.|$|E

Levying of fees is criticised by some {{on the grounds that}} it is financially onerous, particularly to students who <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> struggling with the associated costs of university study. Others cite that the associated financial benefits of robust representation provided by students' associations result in lower fees and higher quality of educational experience for students.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{weight loss}} {{increases}} risk of gallstones. Patients taking orlistat, a weight loss drug, <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> {{at increased risk}} for the formation of gall stones. Weight loss with orlistat can increase the risk of gall stones. On the contrary, ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), a bile acid, also a drug marketed as Ursodiol, appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged.|$|E

25|$|Conflicted romantic {{infidelity}} {{takes place}} {{when a person}} both {{falls in love with}} and has a strong sexual desire for multiple people at one time, even though s/he <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> committed to a partner. In this circumstance the person feels s/he cannot tell his/her committed partner about what has happened, but is nevertheless unable to resist the compulsion; this lack of open discussion is usually what separates conflicted romantic infidelity from things like a well-defined open relationship or polyamory.|$|E
25|$|CML {{is often}} {{divided into three}} phases based on {{clinical}} characteristics and laboratory findings. In the absence of intervention, CML typically begins in the chronic phase, and {{over the course of}} several years progresses to an accelerated phase and ultimately to a blast crisis. Blast crisis is the terminal phase of CML and clinically behaves like an acute leukemia. Drug treatment will usually stop this progression if started early. One of the drivers of the progression from chronic phase through acceleration and blast crisis is the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome). Some patients <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> in the accelerated phase or blast crisis by the time they are diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{one giant}} African snail, Achatina fulica, lays 100 to 400 {{elliptical}} eggs that each measure about 5mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, {{usually in the}} wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like H. pomatia, or lay eggs {{on the surface of}} a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4mm long. These snails grow up to 10mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35mm long and <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> sexually mature. Sexual maturity takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of calcium. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.|$|E

25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> married.|$|E
25|$|Species of swallow {{and martin}} that are {{threatened}} with extinction are generally endangered due to habitat loss. This {{is presumed to}} be the reason behind {{the decline of the}} critically endangered white-eyed river martin, a species that is only known from a few specimens collected in Thailand. The species presumably breeds in riverbanks, a much diminished habitat in SE Asia. As the species hasn't been reliably seen since 1980 it <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> extinct. Two insular species, the Bahama swallow and golden swallow, have declined due to forest loss and also competition with introduced species such as starlings and sparrows, which compete with these swallows for nesting sites. The golden swallow formerly bred on the island of Jamaica, but was last seen there in 1989 and is now restricted to the island of Hispaniola.|$|E
25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which <b>may</b> <b>already</b> <b>be</b> occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, or a particular road in a marshaling yard. Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E
