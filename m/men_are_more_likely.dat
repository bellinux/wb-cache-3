Children and young adults {{are less likely to be}} affected than the elderly: the risk increases by 20% for every decade of life. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent studies}} {{indicate}} that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age. In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more. In terms of blogs, <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to blog in the first place; among those who blog, <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have a professional blog, whereas women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have a personal blog.|$|R

25|$|Research has {{indicated}} {{that women are more}} likely to be left hemisphere dominant, and <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be right hemisphere dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from left hemisphere damage, and <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to recover faster from right hemisphere damage. Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E

30|$|There are notable {{effects of}} other factors. Men {{compared}} to women tend have lower status jobs but higher earnings (both hourly and weekly).

25|$|<b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have fat {{stored in}} the abdomen due to sex hormone differences.

25|$|Most {{people are}} married {{when they reach}} {{retirement}} age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to retire if their wives are also retired than if they {{are still in the}} labor force, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions. Most people will experience at least one traumatizing event in their lifetime. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience a traumatic event, but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Among other behaviors, {{this means}} that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to favour {{chastity}} in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. Such a strategy is seen in males, and maternity is never doubted by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by a women. However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromising his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} found that women who are not {{interested}} in a new relationship have explicitly decided to remain unpartnered. In contrast, <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report that they would not rule out the possibility but had not encountered a suitable relationship yet. Interviews indicate that widowers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> prepared than widows {{to take a chance on}} a new relationship.|$|R
40|$|Historians of U. S. race {{relations}} typically portray southern whites as reluctant to recognize or act favorably upon complexion-based differences within the African American community. Historians contend that mixed-race African Americans (mulattoes) received few advantages {{as a result}} of their partly white heritage. This paper shows that a there was a distinct complexion gap in late antebellum America. Mulatto <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than black <b>men</b> to own farms or operate them as tenants, whereas black <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to find employment as farm laborers throughout their lives. Quantile regressions also reveal a complexion gap in wealth accumulation. Mulattoes acquired more property than blacks, particularly at the upper end of the wealth distribution. Thus, an analysis of data included in the 1860 census implies a complex social hierarchy based on subtle gradations in skin color. At the upper end of the wealth distribution, light-complected mulattoes demonstrated a greater propensity to socioeconomic advancement than dark-complected blacks. ...|$|R
50|$|In an American {{study in}} 2005, the {{percentage}} of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of {{the percentage of}} women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age. In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.

25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while {{women are more likely}} to lie to please others. We are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where we are able to use lies and deception to enhance our chances of survival and reproduction. Stereotypically speaking, men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.|$|E
25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{state that}} {{gay and lesbian}} couples {{experience}} domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals {{are less likely to}} report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. One study focusing on Hispanic men indicated that gay men are less likely to have been perpetrators or victims of domestic violence than heterosexual men but that bisexual <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have been both. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence {{at the same rate as}} heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.|$|E
50|$|Research from Lawrence University {{has found}} that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> hired in {{traditionally}} masculine jobs, such as sales management, and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> hired in traditionally feminine jobs, such as receptionist or secretary. However, individuals of either gender with masculine personality traits were advantaged when applying for either masculine or feminine jobs, indicating a possibly valuing of stereotypically male traits above stereotypically female traits.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study done}} by Michelle Davies and Samantha McCartney {{discusses}} why <b>men</b> <b>are</b> often blamed or stigmatized for their rape. They found that heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to blame the}} victim, show less empathy for the victim, deny or diminish {{the seriousness of the}} attack, and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to believe rape myths than heterosexual women and homosexual men. One reason for this is the societal pressure placed on <b>men</b> to <b>be</b> strong, tough, and assertive rather than passive, gentle and [...] "feminine" [...] as mentioned earlier. Another cause for negative reaction toward male rape victims is linked to homophobia. Davies and McCartney and previous research has found a correlation between male victim blame and homophobia, since male rape involving a male rapist is (nonconsensual) sex between two men. The study also revealed that heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> against the victim if the victim was perceived to be homosexual rather than heterosexual. Homosexual men, similar to heterosexual women, were made to feel like they had [...] "asked for it" [...] based on their behavior.|$|R

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} posit additionally that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{than women}} to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey {{found that men}} were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other {{research has shown that}} men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while {{women are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Laurie Guy {{observed that}} Sexual Preference relied on adult recollection of childhood, {{a type of}} evidence that had been criticized by Gagnon and Simon {{as long ago as}} 1973.

The neuroscientist Simon LeVay wrote in Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why (2010) that statistical studies support Freud′s view that on average gay <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than straight men to describe their relationships with their mothers as close and their relationships with their fathers as distant or hostile; he cited Bell et al. in support of this claim.|$|E
