25|$|Londinium grew {{up around}} the point on the River Thames narrow enough for the {{construction}} of a Roman bridge but still deep enough to handle the era's seagoing ships. Its placement on the Tideway permitted easier access for ships sailing upstream against the current. The remains of a massive pier base for such a bridge were found in 1981 close by the modern London Bridge. Some Claudian-era camp ditches have been discovered, but archaeological excavations undertaken since the 1970s by the Department of Urban Archaeology at the Museum of London (now <b>MOLAS)</b> have suggested the early settlement was largely the product of private enterprise. A timber drain by the side of the main Roman road excavated at No 1 Poultry has been dated by dendrochronology to 47, which is likely to be the foundation date.|$|E
500|$|The Moche {{people of}} ancient Peru worshipped animals, and often {{depicted}} frogs in their art.

Today, despite being extinct in the wild, Panamanian golden frogs remain an important cultural symbol and are illustrated on decorative cloth <b>molas</b> made by the Kuna people.

50|$|Once {{part of the}} Museum of London, Museum of London Archaeology (<b>MOLA)</b> {{became an}} {{independent}} charity in November 2011, regulated by the Charity Commission for England and Wales. <b>MOLA</b> now has its own Board of Trustees but the Museum of London and <b>MOLA</b> continue to work together. <b>MOLA</b> employs around 190 archaeologists working {{on most of the}} major archaeological sites in London. Independence gives <b>MOLA</b> a stronger remit; it streamlines operations, reduces duplication and cuts red tape. Originally, <b>MOLA</b> was a much smaller department within the Museum of London but it expanded hugely - and outgrew its parent organisation. Independence gives <b>MOLA</b> the freedom to operate and to explore new markets across the country and overseas.|$|R

2500|$|In {{evaluating}} the marble cross-section, the United States Geological Survey found the marble is bounded {{above and below}} by unconformities. This lack of conformable contact resulted in the early dating of the limestone as Silurian rather than the currently accepted Mississippian. The lack of conformable boundaries in exposures along the Treasure Mountain dome explains the variation in reported thicknesses in the quarry area west of Yule Creek of [...] about [...] southeast of the quarry. The overlying Pennsylvanian <b>Molas</b> Formation was an argillite unit which was converted to hornfels and quartzite. Stratigraphically below the [...] Leadville, the chert bearing Devonian Dyer Dolomite Member of the Chaffee Formation was altered by the metamorphism to impure silica-rich marble and occasional serpentine-bearing marble.|$|E
2500|$|The gubernatorial {{palace and}} old large forum {{seem to have}} fallen out of use around 300, but in general {{the first half of}} the 4th century appears to have been a prosperous time for Britain, for the villa estates {{surrounding}} London appear to have flourished during this period. The London Mithraeum was rededicated, probably to Bacchus. A list of the 16 [...] "archbishops" [...] of London was recorded by Jocelyne of Furness in the 12th century, claiming the city's Christian community was founded in the 2nd century under the legendary KingLucius and his missionary saints Fagan, Deruvian, Elvanus, and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop Restitutus or Adelphius at the 314 Council of Arles seems to have come from Londinium. The location of Londinium's original cathedral is uncertain. The present structure of StPeter upon Cornhill was designed by Christopher Wren following the Great Fire in 1666 but it stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium and medieval legends tied it to the city's earliest Christian community. In 1995, however, a large and ornate 4th-century building on Tower Hill was discovered: built sometime between 350 and 400, it seems to have mimicked StAmbrose's cathedral in the imperial capital at Milan on a still-larger scale. It was about [...] long by about [...] wide. Excavations by David Sankey of <b>MOLAS</b> established it was constructed out of stone taken from other buildings, including a veneer of black marble. It was probably dedicated to StPaul.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the sunfish's various names {{allude to}} its {{flattened}} shape. Its specific name, <b>mola,</b> is Latin for [...] "millstone", which the fish resembles {{because of its}} gray color, rough texture, and rounded body. Its common English name, sunfish, refers to the animal's habit of sunbathing at {{the surface of the}} water. The Dutch-, Portuguese-, French-, Catalan-, Spanish-, Italian-, Russian-, Greek- and German-language names, respectively maanvis, peixe lua, poisson lune, peix lluna, pez luna, pesce luna, рыба-луна, φεγγαρόψαρο and Mondfisch, mean [...] "moon fish", in reference to its rounded shape. In German, the fish is also known as Schwimmender Kopf, or [...] "swimming head". In Polish, it is named samogłów, meaning [...] "head alone", because it has no true tail. The Chinese translation of its academic name is fan-che yu 翻車魚, meaning [...] "toppled wheel fish".The ocean sunfish has various superseded binomial synonyms, and was originally classified in the pufferfish genus, as Tetraodon mola.It is now placed in its own genus, <b>Mola,</b> with three species: <b>Mola</b> <b>mola,</b> <b>Mola</b> trecta (Hoodwinker Sunfish) [...] and <b>Mola</b> ramsayi.
