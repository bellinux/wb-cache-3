5|$|Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō {{discovered}} in 1890 that diphtheria and tetanus toxins were neutralized {{in the bloodstream}} of animals by substances they called antitoxins, which were specific for the respective toxin.

5|$|Engleromyces sinensis {{is used in}} China in {{traditional}} <b>medicine</b> <b>for</b> its antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties, and is sold in market stalls in Yunnan. Several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from the fungus. It produces engleromycin, a cytochalasin. This compound, which is also made by E.goetzii, has antibiotic and cytotoxic activity. Additional metabolites include the novel compound neoengleromycin, and the previously known cytochalasin D and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D. Neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine-substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton.|$|E

5|$|Insects {{are also}} used in <b>medicine,</b> <b>for</b> example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E
5|$|One {{short-lived}} gamma ray-emitting {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear <b>medicine</b> <b>for</b> {{a wide variety}} of diagnostic tests. The ground state of this nuclide, technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} malaria {{stretches}} from its prehistoric origin as a zoonotic {{disease in the}} primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except Antarctica. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and <b>medicine</b> <b>for</b> hundreds of years. Since {{the discovery of the}} parasites which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, {{as well as that of}} the mosquitoes which transmit the parasites.|$|E

Alumnus Jack W.

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} has been hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} <b>medicine,</b> <b>for</b> amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.|$|E

Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in <b>medicine</b> <b>for</b> four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced <b>medicine</b> <b>for</b> about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or <b>Medicine</b> <b>for</b> this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E
