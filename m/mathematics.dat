5|$|In 1910, Whitehead {{resigned}} {{his senior}} lectureship in <b>mathematics</b> at Trinity {{and moved to}} London without first lining up another job. After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied <b>mathematics</b> and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied <b>Mathematics</b> and Mechanics, a position {{for which he had}} hoped to be seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Whitehead {{accepted}} {{a position as}} professor of applied <b>mathematics</b> at the newly chartered Imperial College London, where his old friend Andrew Forsyth had recently been appointed chief professor of <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, on the 125th {{anniversary of}} his birth, the Indian Government {{declared}} that 22 December will be celebrated every year as National <b>Mathematics</b> Day. Then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also declared that the year 2012 would be celebrated as the National <b>Mathematics</b> Year.|$|E
5|$|In September 2004, {{the school}} was {{designated}} a music and <b>mathematics</b> specialist school, which means it receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, {{the school was}} invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As <b>mathematics</b> is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English and science with <b>mathematics</b> specialist school.|$|E
5|$|In the Spring of 1924, Göppert {{entered the}} University of Göttingen, where she studied <b>mathematics.</b> A purported {{shortage}} of women <b>mathematics</b> teachers for schools for girls {{led to an}} upsurge of women studying <b>mathematics</b> {{at a time of}} high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of <b>mathematics</b> at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period he served {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the <b>mathematics</b> panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of <b>Mathematics</b> in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical <b>mathematics</b> and physics.|$|E
5|$|Lieberman Aiden studied <b>mathematics,</b> physics, and {{philosophy}} at Princeton, {{and earned a}} master's degree in History at Yeshiva University. He proceeded to complete a joint PhD in <b>mathematics</b> and bioengineering at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, where he was advised by Eric Lander and Martin Nowak.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{taught at}} several {{institutions}} including St. Louis University before becoming chair of University of Notre Dame's <b>mathematics</b> department in 1946. He started a teacher training program in <b>mathematics</b> that {{evolved into the}} Ross <b>Mathematics</b> Program in 1957 {{with the addition of}} high school students. The program moved with him to Ohio State University when he became their department chair in 1963. Though forced to retire in 1976, Ross ran the summer program until 2000. He had worked with over 2,000 students during more than forty summers.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, {{majoring in}} <b>mathematics</b> {{with a minor}} in English and graduating in 1945. Jennings was awarded the only <b>mathematics</b> degree in her class. Although she had originally intended to study journalism, she decided to change to <b>mathematics</b> {{because she had a}} bad relationship with her adviser. Later in her life, she earned a master's degree in English at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.|$|E

5|$|This is the begriffliche Mathematik (purely {{conceptual}} <b>mathematics)</b> {{that was}} characteristic of Noether. This style of <b>mathematics</b> was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, {{especially in the}} (then new) field of abstract algebra.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mathematics</b> is {{essential}} in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied <b>mathematics</b> has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure <b>mathematics,</b> or <b>mathematics</b> for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied <b>mathematics,</b> and practical applications for what began as pure <b>mathematics</b> are often discovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the Committee on the American <b>Mathematics</b> Competitions (CAMC) are {{dedicated}} {{to the goal of}} strengthening the mathematical capabilities of our nation's youth. The CAMC believes that one way to meet this goal is to identify, recognize and reward excellence in <b>mathematics</b> through a series of national contests called the American <b>Mathematics</b> Competitions. The AMC include: the American <b>Mathematics</b> Contest 8 (AMC 8) (formerly the American Junior High School <b>Mathematics</b> Examination) for students in grades 8 and below, begun in 1985; the American <b>Mathematics</b> Contest 10 (AMC 10), for students in grades 9 and 10, begun in 2000; the American <b>Mathematics</b> Contest 12 (AMC 12) (formerly the American High School <b>Mathematics</b> Examination) for students in grades 11 and 12, begun in 1950; the American Invitational <b>Mathematics</b> Examination (AIME), begun in 1983; and the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), begun in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of <b>mathematics</b> is {{the branch of}} philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of <b>mathematics,</b> and purports to provide a viewpoint {{of the nature and}} methodology of <b>mathematics,</b> and to understand the place of <b>mathematics</b> in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of <b>mathematics</b> itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Foundations of <b>mathematics</b> is {{the study}} of the {{philosophical}} and logical and/or algorithmic basis of <b>mathematics,</b> or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of <b>mathematics.</b> In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of <b>mathematics</b> and philosophy of <b>mathematics</b> turns out to be quite vague.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{practical}} applications have motivated {{the development of}} mathematical theories, which then {{became the subject of}} study in pure <b>mathematics,</b> where <b>mathematics</b> is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied <b>mathematics</b> is vitally connected with research in pure <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} {{that takes place}} at the Banff International Research Station is either in pure <b>mathematics,</b> applied <b>mathematics,</b> or in other areas of science where they intersect with <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that certain}} scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are <b>mathematics</b> with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. <b>Mathematics</b> shares {{much in common with}} many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also {{play a role in the}} formulation of conjectures in both <b>mathematics</b> and the (other) sciences. Experimental <b>mathematics</b> continues to grow in importance within <b>mathematics,</b> and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E

Much of core <b>mathematics</b> can be formalized in these weak subsystems, some of which are defined below.

25|$|The real {{numbers are}} most often formalized using the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical {{foundations}} of <b>mathematics.</b> In particular, the real numbers are also studied in reverse <b>mathematics</b> and in constructive <b>mathematics.</b>|$|E
