5000|$|In electronics, a Lecher line or Lecher wires {{is a pair}} of {{parallel}} wires or rods that were used to measure the wavelength of radio waves, mainly at UHF and microwave frequencies. [...] They form a short length of balanced transmission line (a resonant stub). When attached to a source of radio-frequency power such as a radio transmitter, the radio waves form standing waves along their length. By sliding a conductive bar that bridges the two wires along their length, the length of the waves can be physically measured. Austrian physicist Ernst Lecher, improving on techniques used by Oliver Lodge and Heinrich Hertz, developed this method of measuring wavelength around 1888. [...] Lecher lines were used as frequency measuring devices until frequency counters became available after World War 2. They were also used as components, often called [...] "resonant stubs", in UHF and <b>microwave</b> <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> such as transmitters, radar sets, and television sets, serving as tank circuits, filters, and impedance-matching devices. [...] They are used at frequencies between HF/VHF, where lumped components are used, and UHF/SHF, where resonant cavities are more practical.|$|E
5000|$|Spectrum Compact is a {{handheld}} microwave spectrum analyzer. Spectrum Compact is a measurement {{solution for the}} 6 - 40 GHz licensed microwave frequency bands; E-band (70 - 87 GHz) and V-band (56 - 67 GHz) frequencies. Designed specifically for comfortable outdoor use by network engineers {{in a variety of}} challenging environments, this battery-powered device is designed for any <b>microwave</b> <b>radio</b> engineer performing <b>equipment</b> installation or gathering data for site planning purposes. The LCD touchscreen ensures smooth and intuitive onsite use, and the SMA connector allows the Spectrum Compact to integrate with any vendors antenna or waveguide system. The Spectrum Compact makes it possible to detect existing interference on installed paths or available radio channels with high precision. Data logging of all spectrum scans is available inside of the Spectrum compact with enhanced data processing and analysis available via SAF Tehnika designed PC software.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using high speed <b>microwave</b> <b>radio</b> links to relay information from the Great Barrier Reef to the Australian mainland. The investigated solution is a low-elevation, microwave link operating at 10. 5 GHz. Radio signals in this band are known to often become trapped in the evaporation duct just above the ocean providing a suitable means to radiate signals well beyond the optical horizon. The paper describes experimental and prediction results for a 78 km link between Davies Reef and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The optimum frequency and antenna heights are determined and the expected variability in the received signal level is determined. It is predicted that using conventional <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> a received {{signal to noise ratio}} of 40 dB should be achievable...|$|R
