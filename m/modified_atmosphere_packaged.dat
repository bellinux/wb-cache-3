Physicochemical properties (pH, a w, drip formation), microbiological quality (psychrotrophic bacteria, coliforms and lactic acid bacteria) and sensory properties were assessed after 3, 6 and 9 days of storage for the conventionally packaged samples and after 5, 10 and 15 {{days for the}} <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> samples. Overall, sodium lactate reduced microbial growth and improved shelf life of fresh sausages; use of sodium lactate at pH 7. 0 gave the best inhibition of microbial growth. pH had no {{significant effect on the}} action of sodium lactate on retention of sensory properties during storage.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{preservation}} {{is an important}} step in stabilizing perishable items {{in order for them to}} withstand distribution, handling, and storage. Preservation can be achieved by several methods, but the method of concern in this paper is that of modified atmosphere storage which is reported to extend the shelf-lives of perishable products. Studies on modified atmosphere storage have emphasized the preservating action of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in reducing (1) the extent of microbial spoilage, and (2) the tissue pH of the products so stored in comparison to those stored aerobically. Low tissue pH creates unfavourable environment which negatively influences the growth of spoilage bacteria. This paper will deal only with modified atmosphere packaging and reduction of aerobic microbial action. The emphasis is on preserving fresh fish for resale. This work explores modified atmosphere packaging and cold storage as two methods used in conjunction to accomplish fresh fish marketing. As a first step in this investigation, this study attempts to: (1) establish criteria for selecting materials for primary packages for modified atmosphere preserved fish, and (2) describe a test to evaluate the suitability of flexible materials for application to <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> fish. Suitability of materials for application to <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> fish is determined by their rate of permeability to CO 2 nitrogen (N 2), and oxygen (O 2) - the gases commonly used in modified atmosphere preservation. The rate of permeability of the materials to these gases is determined by gas chromatography...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} fermentative {{metabolism}} at low temperature on cell division of Bacillus cereus was studied. Fermentation at 37 C had no {{influence on the}} division of bacteria. Aerobic cultures at 15 C produced larger cells than at 37 C, but cell division was normal. In fermentative cultures at 15 C, no increase in CFU ml À 1 was observed. However, A 600 increased, due to formation of long filaments. Transmission electronic microscopy and light microscopy with fluorescent staining showed several nucleic acid entities separated by a hydrophobic membrane, indicating that each filament contained several individual cells attached by peptidoglycan. When left in air at room temperature, one filament gave several daughter cells, this means that one CFU formed by one filament may represent a greater contamination potential than one CFU formed by a single cell. Division was observed in cultures at 15 C with anaerobic respiration {{in the presence of}} nitrates. Possible filamentous growth must thus be taken into account to avoid underestimating B. cereus growth in vacuum or <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> foods stored at low temperature...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the minimization of off-flavor occurrence and the maintenance of high quality in <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> Pleurotus ostreatus during the storage. There are 4 treatments used to preserve high quality and for deodorization of MAP mushroom: Artemisia princeps, Artemisia capillaries, green tea and activated charcoal. The mushrooms were packed in polyethylene film with each treatment and were stored at 5 and 20 oC. No difference was observed in weight loss, CO 2 and O 2 concentration, or color of mushrooms packed with or without treatment. However, the principal component analysis (PCA), electronic nose, revealed differences in off-flavor occurrence between control (MAP mushroom without treatment) and treatment groups at 5 oC. This result suggested that Artemisia princeps and Artemisia capillaries was masking the off-flavor in MAP mushroom because the unique flavor of them was strongly revealed and green tea and activated charcoal might have a role of removing the off-flavor by adsorbing ethanol and acetaldehyde, which is known to cause off-flavor.

Bacteria counts of the raw meatball samples increased 2 log cycles at the end of storage compared with initial values.

40|$|Polyphenolic {{compounds}} occurring {{naturally in}} knotwood of plants {{are known to}} have antimicrobial effects. The knots (i. e. the branch bases inside tree stems) and outer branches in pine trees contain a remarkably high concentration of phenolic stilbenes, while lignans are the major phenolic constituents of spruce knots. Large amount of these phenolic compounds can be extracted from wood knots at pulp and paper mills where their presence is undesirable. In Finland, marinating of broiler meat is done not only to increase or add value to the meat, but also to enhance the safety and shelf-life. These products are usually packed under a modified atmosphere for further protection against spoilage microorganisms. However, studies have revealed that addition of marinades to poultry products do not have an inhibitory effect on either some psychrotrophic anaerobic bacteria, such as Brochothrix thermosphacta or lactic acid bacteria associated with spoilage. Also, the activity of pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni is not affected by marinating. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the inhibitory and lethal activities of extracts from spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) knotwood and outer branches that are dissolved in ethanol against the spoilage microorganisms in <b>modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> marinated broiler products. <b>Modified</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>packaged</b> broiler products were separately inoculated with ‘normal’ marinades, marinades with 70 % ethanol, marinades with a mixture of spruce and pine extracts dissolved in 70 % ethanol or mixture of spruce and pine extracts in powder form.

The results showed that there were significant differences in bacterial colony forming units per gram (P < 0. 05) between packages with ‘normal’ marinades and packages with extracts added to their marinades on the 12 th and 15 th day. It can be concluded that the addition of extracts from spruce and pine knotwood to marinades significantly retarded growth of spoilage microorganisms during the 15 day test period. However further research is warranted to characterise and establish the safety and suitability of the compound(s) in spruce and pine knotwood extracts that are responsible for inhibitory or lethal activity against the microbes that may be present in marinated poultry meat...|$|E
40|$|The polyene {{macrolide}} antibiotic natamycin (Antibiotic A- 5283) {{is commonly used}} to retard the growth of surface molds on various cheese varieties. Natamycin is commonly applied {{to the surface of}} cheese by dipping or spraying, using an aqueous dispersion containing 200 to 300 ppm of the additive. The large molecular weight of natamycin, 666 g/mol, and conjugated double bond structure causes it to be extremely insoluble in water and most food grade solvents. The inability to apply natamycin in true solution creates void non-treated areas on the food surface. These non-treated areas promote the growth of fungal organisms. A water soluble N-alkyl semisynthetic derivative of natamycin was synthesized by the Michael addition reaction of the parent with a N-substituted malemide.
