50|$|One of {{the sites}} where various Phyllolepis {{specimens}} have been discovered, Red Hill in Pennsylvania, shows signs of having been a freshwater subhabitat, similar to current Midwestern lakes. However, dig sites in Europe- and even locations still in the Pennsylvania Catskill formation- may have been home to coastal-marine Phyllolepis species, based on the composition of siltstones and sediment deposits. At least one phyllolepid specimen has been found surrounded by plant material and greenish siltstones, suggesting a low energy environment, such as a floodplain pond. This divide raises some questions about how the genus lived in both places. It is possible there were land connections intercontinentally, or the fishes were euryhaline or marine-tolerant.The fish may have even evolved a freshwater habit after arriving in North America by <b>marine</b> <b>waterways.</b>|$|R

40|$|Maritime {{performance}} inherently {{links to}} economies of commerce. It’s history and practices reorient theatre within broad frames of transnationalism. While airplanes crisscross skies transporting modern passengers across national boundaries, boats amble across <b>marine</b> <b>waterways</b> linking performance traditions through ports and onboard performance. Maritime performances - theatre, {{music and dance}} activities on ships, along shipping routes or within port environments – immerse participants in interactive cultural play. “Megaship Economies and Transnational Maritime Acts” uses {{the lens of the}} cruise industry as a microcosmic study of identity formation through maritime performance praxis. Performances at sea enable roleplaying of both passengers, and crewmembers and activate all sectors of the ship. Collectively sea acts pass time, provide a forum for recognition of talent, and allow for cultural exchanges across social boundaries. While land-based scholars may view the shore as the departure point for cultural forays and exchanges, the maritime subject considers the port as a temporary layover point before the next long journey. For maritime performers, notions of voyage and destination invert. Knowledge travels in circles when performers ride ocean currents and old histories resurface within contemporary practices. Mega ships support performance economies where the voyage dominates even as economies of power persist...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the global economy, growing demand by producers, {{distributors}} and consumers, increasing competitive pressure in all market actors, which undoubtedly implies the need for implementing new strategies and {{a higher level of}} effective planning, coordination and cooperation between national economies and companies worldwide. In this regard, particular question is how to improve conditions in those economies that have no direct outlet to the sea, and thus lead to a situation of "geographical handicap" in terms of countries with direct access to the <b>marine</b> <b>waterways.</b> Despite the fact that all developing countries have some way to go to economic and social welfare, the landlocked states have done worse {{as a result of their}} distinctive geographic handicaps. Landlocked countries not only face the challenge of long distance and isolation, but also the challenges that result from a dependence on passage through a sovereign transit country, one through which trade from a landlocked country must pass in order to access international shipping markets. Most discussions suggest that there is a complex relationships between landlocked countries i. e. transport isolation from world markets and economic growth and logistics costs. High logistics costs often depend from one side the poor road infrastructure but other side from mostly low level of logistics management and predictability which itself stem mostly from rent-seeking and governance issues that increase uncertainty along logistics chains. ...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance {{dredging}} of <b>marine</b> <b>waterways</b> {{is necessary}} to ensure the efficiency and safety of the vessels navigating into the shallow waters. The dislodged sediments, commonly known as dredged soils are generally disposed of as a geo-waste. From the geotechnical point of view, the soil, mainly fine-grained particles like silt and clay, is too poorly for engineering applications. However, with suitable handling and treatment, it can be potentially reused as any sound geo-materials. Two feasible yet economical options for improving the remoulded strength of the soft material are as follows: (1) to partially pre-drain the soil in a backfill to improve the plasticity, and (2) to lightly solidify the soil with small dosages of binder, like cement. The present study examines the remoulded strength of high plasticity silt retrieved from a dredged site. The fine-grained soil was originally found to be in liquefied form (water content is 1. 75 times the soil’s liquid limit) with negligible shear strength or resistance. The material was semi-dried to form 60 mm thick soil beds at 0. 90, 1. 25 and 1. 76 times the liquid limit. A separate set of soil beds (water content = 1. 25 times the liquid limit) were also prepared to determine the efficacy of light solidification in the remoulded strength, i. e. with 1, 3 and 5 % cement addition in the soil. The fall cone and vane shear tests were next carried out for each soil bed at predetermined intervals up to a week. The strength gain over time was recorded as reduction in the cone penetration and corresponding increase in the shea...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to growing}} human {{activity}} in coastal zones, {{there is an}} increasing stress on salt marshes all over the world. These intertidal wetlands were often seen as coastal ‘wasteland’ and large areas were reclaimed for urban development and agriculture. In Puget Sound, a system of interconnected <b>marine</b> <b>waterways</b> and basins in the northwest of the United States, {{this has lead to}} an 80 % loss of marsh area in the last 150 years. In recent years however there has been a growing recognition of their value as habitat for fish, birds and numerous species of plants and as coastal protection. In many countries they are now protected areas and numerous restoration projects are being carried out or planned. One of the largest of these restoration projects takes place in the Nisqually River estuary, in the southern end of Puget Sound. By removing a dike, built in the early 1900 s for farming purposes, an area of nearly 405 hectares was reintroduced to the salt water and tides of Puget Sound on November 12, 2009. The goal {{of this study was to}} research how this dike removal will affect the estuary in the coming years. A computational model was set up in Delft 3 D to describe hydrological and morphological processes, with focus on the interaction with vegetation. The vegetation in Delft 3 D is schematized as cylindrical rods, which add extra source terms to the momentum equation. An external Matlab routine was used to calculate changes in the vegetation field based on the model results. Because this type of vegetation modeling had not been done on this scale before and there were large uncertainties in the required parameters, first a sensitivity analysis was carried out with a schematized model. By doing different runs, changing one parameter at a time, the relative importance of each parameter was examined. The most important parameters were then researched further so that a detailed final model could be set up, with a discharge from the Nisqually River on the southern boundary and tidal forcing on the northern boundary. With the use of a morphological factor a period of 10 years was simulated. Due to limitations in computation time and the lack of some important data, concessions had to be made in the setup of the model. These concessions, combined with the fact that the model could not be validated since there were no post-restoration measurements available at the moment of writing, make it hard to determine the accuracy of the model predictions. Therefore the results should not be seen as an exact prediction, but more as a qualitative impression of how the area is going to develop in the coming years. It was concluded that success of salt marsh restoration mainly depends on elevation. Higher areas are inundated for a shorter amount of time, which makes it easier for pioneer vegetation to establish. During the period in which the restoration area was diked no sediment was brought in, which caused subsidence. As a result, a salt marsh can develop in the eastern part of the estuary but the western part of the estuary is too low to be colonized. However, the dike removal will allow sediment from the Nisqually River to enter the area again, so if enough sediment is provided the elevation will increase, allowing the marsh to expand further. This suggests that sediment discharge from the river is a key factor, and it is therefore recommended to measure this in the future. An alternative scenario, in which the river is forced to flow through the restoration area, was also examined, based on expectations for high river discharges. This increases the amount of sediment that is imported into the area, and could therefore have a positive effect on the salt marsh development. It does however also influence the salinity, which has a large impact on the distribution of vegetation. Further research into these effects is recommended if forcing this change is considered.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{recession}} resulting from the financial crisis of 2008, European demand for natural gas is essentially stagnant and has recently lost market share to coal and renewables in the power generation sector in various European national markets. This factor, as well as the significant price differential between natural gas and oil products since 2008, has created renewed interest in the market for natural gas in transport. Gas in transport is neither new nor revolutionary. An assessment of gas’ prospects in this sector relates to its ability to displace other fuels (existing and new alternatives). An additional complication is the need to consider transportation sub-sectors, namely: light duty road transport, public passenger road transport, freight and goods vehicles and <b>marine</b> and inland <b>waterway</b> shipping. In this comprehensive paper Chris Le Fevre draws on extensive research and discussion with interested bodies to address the case for natural gas in transport, the extent and likelihood of its adoption, the long term implications for additional European gas demand and the key policy drivers and structural challenges which would encourage or inhibit these developments. </p...|$|R
