40|$|We {{report the}} {{measurement}} of small losses in transmission line (TL) components intended for high-power millimeter-wave applications. Measurements were made using two different low-power techniques: a coherent technique using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and an incoherent technique using a radiometer. The <b>measured</b> <b>loss</b> in a 140 GHz 12. 7 mm diameter TL system, consisting of 1. 7 m of circular corrugated waveguide and three miter bends, {{is dominated by the}} miter bend loss. The <b>measured</b> <b>loss</b> was 0. 3 ± 0. 1 dB per miter bend using a VNA; and 0. 22 ± 0. 1 dB per miter bend using a radiometer. Good agreement between the two measurement techniques implies that both are useful for measuring small losses. To verify the methodology, the VNA technique was employed to measure the extremely small transmission loss in a 170 GHz ITER prototype TL system consisting of three lengths of 1 m, 63. 5 mm diameter, circular corrugated waveguide and two miter bends. The <b>measured</b> <b>loss</b> of 0. 05 ± 0. 02 dB per miter bend may be compared with the theoretical loss of 0. 027 dB per miter bend. These results suggest that low-power testing of TL losses, utilizing a small, simple TL system and a VNA, is a reliable method for evaluating performance of low-loss millimeter-wave T...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{tools are}} {{available}} in market to <b>measure</b> packet <b>loss</b> in the end-to-end networks. But all the existing tools {{are not able to}} calculate packet loss in the network accurately. So <b>measuring</b> packet <b>loss</b> efficiently is still an open problem in the networks due to relatively occurrence and short duration of packet loss. The aim of our research is to understand how to efficiently calculate packet loss in the network. In this paper we presented an algorithm for <b>measuring</b> packet <b>loss</b> in the network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we simulate the algorithm in the NS 2 simulator. Our experimental results shows the trade-offs between impact on the network and measurement accuracy. We show that <b>measuring</b> packet <b>loss</b> is more efficient in our proposed algorithm than traditional loss measurement tools...|$|R

In these applications the superconductor is exposed to an alternating magnetic field that has different orientations {{with respect to the}} tape surface. In this paper the angle dependency of the magnetisation loss is considered from two points of view. First the measurement technique with pickup coils is analysed theoretically. Measured magnetisation loss in uni-directional magnetic field with various orientations and rotating magnetic field are compared. When the orientation is changed from perpendicular (0 °) to parallel (90 °) applied magnetic fields, the contribution of the perpendicular field component to the magnetisation loss is dominant up to 60 °. A new model to describe the angle dependency of the magnetisation loss, based on the <b>measured</b> <b>loss</b> in perpendicular and parallel magnetic field is developed. Deviations between models and the <b>measured</b> <b>loss</b> are explained {{with the help of the}} theoretical analysis of the measurement technique.
