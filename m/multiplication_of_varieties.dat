The results of many of these are not ready for publication as it requires several years for their verification. The purpose of these notes is to give some information regarding the principal varieties of farm crops grown in Iowa. It is not our policy to advocate the <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties,</b> but rather to encourage the improvement of those recognized as standard. It must not be understood, however, that varieties not mentioned here are to be regarded as worthless. If results compare favorably with those herein contained, it is not advised that any change be made in the seed used. In addition to the use of good varieties, there are other factors which contribute to success in growing crops, among which soil cultivation and rotation play an important part. It might be mentioned here that clover is given a place every fourth year in our rotation. This, together with the proper care and application of manure, enables us to keep the soil in a high state of fertility...|$|E
40|$|Semigroup theory {{typically}} {{looks at}} algebraic structures which are generalizations of groups. An {{example of such}} a generalization is a semigroup which is a union of groups. When the usual semigroup multiplication is supplemented with a unary operation which selects the group inverse of an element, the class of completely regular semigroups forms a variety, or equationally defined class, of unary semigroups. In this dissertation, we look at several problems which concern varieties of completely regular semigroups or closely related objects. The standard examples of varieties of completely regular semigroups are groups, completely simple semigroups, and idempotent semigroups (bands). The lattice of band varieties has been completely described. We make use of the list of inequivalent identities this lattice provides to consider the question of whether and when band free products lie in a proper subvariety of bands. We obtain an example of a band free product of two normal bands which lies in no proper subvariety. We also show that, in some special cases, the band free product of two bands will lie in a proper subvariety. In another problem, we consider a particular <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties,</b> known as a Mal 2 ̆ 7 cev product. For arbitrary completely regular varieties, this construction does not in general yield a variety, but it has previously been shown to yield a variety when the first component of a product is a variety of rectangular groups, and the second one, an arbitrary variety. We extend this result to allow the first component to be a variety of central completely simple semigroups. The largest part of the dissertation is devoted to the topic of the lattice of completely regular monoid varieties, denoted L(MCR). Paralleling a previous result for the lattice of completely regular semigroup varieties L(CR), we show that L(MCR) can be represented as a lattice of order-preserving mappings from a certain ordered set into a slightly modified subset of L(MCR). Our result is somewhat simpler than the original result for L(CR) because L(MCR) is isomorphic to a sublattice of L(CR) which exhibits special properties with respect to the mapping representation, and these carry over to our representation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to evaluate the in-vitro <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> two <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), “Brigitta” and “Legacy” in response to five explants densities (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25) and four flask volumes (10, 20, 30 and 40 mL) for cultivation. For both varieties the cultivation medium WPM (Woody Plant Medium) was used. The experiment was completely randomized with 20 treatments and 12 repetitions per treatment. After 45 days of cultivation we evaluated the height of shoots, number of shoots/explant, number of nodes/shoot and number <b>of</b> shoots/flask. <b>Variety</b> “Brigitta” had highest shoots at higher densities and flask volumes, while variety “Legacy” had the highest average shoot height with intermediate densities and high volumes. Regarding the number of shoots/explant, {{the volume of the}} medium had no influence on “Brigitta”, however, higher plant densities affected this parameter. With variety “Legacy” the maximum number of shoots was achieved with lower plant densities and intermediate culture volumes per flask. In relation to the number of nodes per explant "Brigitta had lower numbers as compared to “Legacy”, but with both <b>varieties</b> the number <b>of</b> nodes decresed with smaller volumes of medium in the flasks. For the number of shoots per flask, “Brigitta” responsed best at higher densities exceeding 40 shoots per flask. In contrast, “Legacy” produced maximum results at density of 25 explants in 30 mL of medium.

Besides enabling the participants to exchange technical information and ideas, the conference sought to identify and prioritize the objectives which would ensure food security through sustainable crop production in Africa; to encourage collaborative research between countries in the region; and to facilitate post-graduate training opportunities among the region's universities. Participants were able to witness the progress that has been made in rehabilitating the soil and plant laboratory analytical facilities at Makerere University; and they were impressed by the overall achievements in rehabilitating the Uganda research infrastructure. During a field tour there were opportunities to see seed multiplication programmes for maize, rice, beans and soybean.

Here we set a transient influenza virus transcription system using luciferase as a reporter gene and cells expressing the three RNA polymerase subunits, PB 1, PB 2 and PA, and NP. We used this reporter assay system and nuclear-localized MxA proteins to get clues for elucidating the anti-influenza virus activity of MxA. Nuclear-localized VP 16 -MxA and MxA-TAg NLS strongly interfered with the influenza virus transcription. Over-expression of PB 2 led to a slight resumption of the transcription inhibition by nuclear MxA, whereas over-expression of PB 1 and PA {{did not affect the}} MxA activity. Of interest is that the inhibitory activity of the nuclear MxA was markedly neutralized by over-expression of NP. An NP devoid of its C-terminal region, but containing the N-terminal RNA binding domain, also neutralized the VP 16 -MxA activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an NP lacking the N-terminal region did not affect the VP 16 -MxA activity. Further, not only VP 16 -MxA but also the wild-type MxA was found to interact with NP in influenza virus-infected cells.

Large quantities of planting material are needed to replace the existing Smooth Cayene and Sugar Loaf varieties commonly grown by farmers.

Liquid cultures required 5. 0 mg l BAP to significantly (P< 0. 05) 1 increase the multiplication rate by 2 - or 5 -fold compared to 7. 5 mg l in solid cultures. When plantlets from 1 optimal treatments were transferred to liquid medium with high concentration (7. 5 - 15 mg l) of NAA there was no root development. However, the transfer of one or two-month old cultured plantlets to solid MS medium supplemented with NAA or IBA alone or combination of NAA and IBA resulted in root production.
