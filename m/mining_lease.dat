The paper will consider the extinguishment of native title by <b>mining</b> <b>leases,</b> {{the effect of the}} Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) on the capacity for <b>mining</b> <b>leases</b> to extinguish native title and the impact of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) on the relationship between <b>mining</b> <b>leases</b> and native title...|$|R

25|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Queensland {{after the collapse}} of his marriage, and was preselected as the One Nation candidate for the seat of Tablelands for the 1998 election, challenging incumbent Mines and Energy Minister Tom Gilmore. Tablelands was considered a safe seat for the rural conservative National Party, held by a margin of more than twenty percent, and Nelson was not generally considered likely to pose a serious threat to Gilmore. Despite having only had three months to campaign, he polled more than 42% of the vote on election day, defeating Gilmore on preferences and becoming Queensland's youngest member of parliament. He declared his priorities upon his election as being the abolition of <b>mining</b> <b>lease</b> fees, the reintroduction of the death penalty, opposition to Aboriginal native title and resisting the deregulation of the dairy industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{planning}} stages commenced for a Marmion Town Centre with 17,000 m² of retail space by 1986 {{in the southwestern}} corner of the suburb to be developed by the Lands Department {{in conjunction with the}} Rural and Industries Bank. A <b>mining</b> <b>lease</b> for sand and limestone was held by Thiess Brothers over part of the land in question (Reserve 8018), so the Lands Department suggested a road (now Burragah Way) be built to separate the proposed centre from the lease. A detailed submission for the centre was made in 1977 by T.S. Martin and Associates, but Warwick, Karrinyup and small local centres had filled the retail need in the area and population had developed somewhat differently from original expectations, so the plan was shelved. Plans to develop a large retail centre were resurrected in the late 1980s to local protest, after which the area was the last to be developed for residential use.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} what were called the Comalco and Aurukun matters. Comalco Aluminium Ltd held several bauxite <b>mining</b> <b>leases</b> {{issued by the}} Queensland State Government under the Comalco Act 1957 (Qld). In each of these claims, the Wik peoples alleged that the <b>mining</b> <b>leases</b> were invalid because the Queensland Government owed {{fiduciary}} duties as a trustee to the Wik people, and that those duties had been breached by the granting of the <b>mining</b> <b>leases.</b> The Aurukun claim also included an attack on an agreement called the Aurukun Associates Agreement entered into under the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act 1975 (Qld).|$|R

25|$|Largely due to {{the company}} nature of the settlement, {{development}} was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town's first newspaper being printed in 1876. Until the National Bank established the first branch in Kooringa, most exchange was either {{in the form of}} company scrip or at shops operating as money exchanges. All towns, except Kooringa, were built outside the <b>mining</b> <b>lease</b> but were still close to the mine as it was at the northern edge of the lease. The formation of the townships was forced by the refusal of SAMA to grant any freeholds within Kooringa, so miners began moving into other townships from the end of 1849. During their early lives each of the townships largely had their own hotels, churches, post offices, schools, and shops and identity. In 1851 the gold rush near Bathurst, New South Wales, emptied the town of many miners. Whole families, government officials and other townspeople left for the gold fields and by 1854 the town appeared largely deserted. The number of townships increased dramatically {{as a result of an}} 1858 proposal to extend a railway line from Gawler. When the railway failed to be built most of the new townships failed and, in 1876, the remaining townships formed the Corporation of Burra.|$|E

AMAX Exploration, {{operating}} as the Yogo Sapphire Project, signed a 22-month lease with Roncor in March1993 {{and had some}} success {{in the middle and}} eastern portions of the dike; it decided not to continue after the end of its lease due to the cost of underground mining, depletion of easily accessible Yogos, and the relatively small size of Yogos then easily accessible. During this time, additional dikes were found in the area using geophysical magnetometer surveys. Low-grade sapphire rough was found in the Eastern Flats Dike, a parallel dike some 500feet northeast of the main dike. Pacific Cascade Sapphires, a Canadian company, had a <b>mining</b> <b>lease</b> with Roncor in 2000 and 2001 but ran out of funds and their option expired. By this time, most of the easily accessible Yogos had been mined and miners had to dig deeper, further increasing costs.|$|E
500|$|The local {{population}} in Miri has indeed started to extract oil from hand-dug wells for centuries. Song Huiyao Jigao, a {{documentation of the}} Song dynasty of China, mentions the imports of Borneo camphor and petroleum in the 11th century. In 1882, Mr de Crespigny reported to the Brooke government on 18 hand-dug oil wells in the Miri area. He also recommended that area near Miri River should be thoroughly explored. However, his recommendations were ignored. But when Charles Hose took over the Resident office in 1891, {{he was interested in}} Mr de Crespigny's idea and began to collaborate with him. Mr de Crespigny began to map oil seeps around the Miri area, however a consultant geologist from England discouraged the oil exploration in Miri due to poor logistical conditions. After his retirement from administrative positions in Sarawak, Charles Hose went back to England. He later went to London to discuss the idea of oil exploration in Miri with the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (later became a part of Royal Dutch Shell Company in 1907). Mr. H.N. Benjamin, a branch manager from the petroleum company, was interested in this idea. Finally in 1909, Rajah Charles Brooke came to London to sign the first Sarawak Oil <b>Mining</b> <b>Lease.</b> Royal Dutch Shell dispatched a senior geologist named Josef Theodor Erb together with Charles Hose back to Miri. Mr Erb started to map Miri oil fields from August 1909 to July 1910. He also identified a location known as [...] "Miri Hill" [...] (now known as [...] "Canada Hill", 150 m above sea level) is suitable to act as an anticline for oil drilling.|$|E

[...] in May 1728, he sought to exploit the patent for iron making processes invented by his son Francis, which He re-patented himself. [...] He financed this by contracting to supply a large quantity of iron to the United Company of Mines Royal and Mineral and Battery Works, who advanced money (or rather saleable shares) with which Wood erected works on Frizington Moor. [...] The works were 375 feet long and 36 feet wide, with 11 furnaces, three horsemill-powered forges and engines for grinding coal and iron ore.|$|E
