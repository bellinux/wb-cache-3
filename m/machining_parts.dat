40|$|Monthly {{counts of}} {{industrial}} <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> errors are modeled using a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) {{in order to}} describe the effect of <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction {{and the amount of}} time spent on the error correction on the likelihood of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> to be in a “defective ” or “non-defective” state. The number of <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> errors were collected from a thermo plastic injection molding machine in a car bumper auto parts manufacturer in Liberec city, Czech Republic from January 2012 to November 2012. A Bayesian method is used for parameter estimation. The results of this study indicate that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and {{the amount of time spent}} on the error correction do not improve the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> status of the individual part, but there is a very strong month-to-month dependence of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> states. Using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion, the performance of the proposed model (MAE = 1. 62) and the HMM including <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction only (MAE = 1. 68), from our previous study, is not significantly different.

5000|$|Lasers can be {{used for}} welding, cladding, marking, surface treatment, drilling, and cutting among other {{manufacturing}} processes. It is used in the automobile, shipbuilding, aerospace, steel, electronics, and medical industries for precision machining of complex parts. Laser welding is advantageous in that it can weld at speeds of up to 100 mm/s as well as the ability to weld dissimilar metals. Laser cladding is used to coat cheap or weak parts with a harder material in order to improve the surface quality. Drilling and cutting with lasers is advantageous in that there is little to no wear on the cutting tool as there is no contact to cause damage. Milling with a laser is a three dimensional process that requires two lasers, but drastically cuts costs of <b>machining</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] Lasers {{can be used}} to change the surface properties of a workpiece.|$|E

When planning with SNLP (McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991), we will show that the resulting plans have the property of minimizing the use of certain key operations.
