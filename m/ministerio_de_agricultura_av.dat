40|$|Mozambique won {{the second}} place in the 16 th {{international}} Agricultural Film Festival (Agrofilm 99) held in October 1999 in Nitra, in Slovakia. The winning film was a 13 -minute production called 'War on Hunger', which showed the losses involved in existing harvest storage facilities. It also showed how to build improved silos using simple techniques. The film was produced during a study of communication in rural areas and was part of the campaign organised on the theme of post-harvest techniques by the Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries. 'War on Hunger' was assisted by the participation of local communities, and was supported by the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture. Two sound tapes, each lasting nine minutes, were also produced. In 1997, Mozambique won a special FAO prize at the same festival for the video 'Drought: the forward-looking farmer is worth double'.

30|$|The larvae of P. longifila {{scrape the}} {{epidermal}} tissues of plant structures using piercing-sucking mouthparts (Gagné 1994). After undergoing three larval stages, the larvae pupate {{in the ground}} (Peña et al. 1989). Because larvae are small (< 1.9 mm, Peña et al. 1989) and the crepuscular habits of adults make them difficult {{to find in the}} field, it is unclear what type of damage P. longifila causes. Our first objective was to characterise the damage caused by P. longifila in host plants. In Colombia, P. longifila feeds on foliar buds, flowers and fruits in tomato, whereas in the United States, it consumes the ovaries, stamens and pistils of Tahiti lime flower buds, causing their abortion (Peña et al. 1989). Based on the phytochemical distance of these two host plants, our second objective was to determine whether P. longifila of tomato is a morphologically different species from that reported in Tahiti lime in the United States. Because Colombia produces 92, 304 tons of limes annually, representing 20.1 % of all national (<b>Ministerio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Agricultura</b> y Desarrollo Rural 2006) and 0.09 % of world lemon and lime production (FAO 2012), and the market for Tahiti lime is expanding in Europe and the United States (<b>Ministerio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Agricultura</b> y Desarrollo Rural 2006; Aguilar-Niño et al. 2012), our third objective was to determine if P. longifila is also found in Tahiti lime in Colombia.|$|R
40|$|Common {{vampire bat}} populations {{distributed}} from Mexico to Argentina are important rabies reservoir hosts in Latin America. The {{aim of this}} work was to analyse the population structure of the rabies virus (RABV) variants associated with vampire bats in the Americas and to study their phylodynamic pattern within Argentina. The phylogenetic analysis based on all available vampire bat-related N gene sequences showed both a geographical and a temporal structure. The two largest groups of RABV variants from Argentina were isolated from northwestern Argentina and from the central western zone of northeastern Argentina, corresponding to livestock areas with different climatic, topographic and biogeographical conditions, which determined their dissemination and evolutionary patterns. In addition, multiple introductions of the infection into Argentina, possibly from Brazil, were detected. The phylodynamic analysis suggests that RABV transmission dynamics is characterized by initial epizootic waves followed by local enzootic cycles with variable persistence. Anthropogenic interventions in the ecosystem should be assessed taking into account not only the environmental impact but also the potential risk of disease spreading through dissemination of current RABV lineages or the emergence of novel ones associated with vampire bats.
