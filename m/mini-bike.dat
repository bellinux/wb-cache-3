5000|$|After Hammond {{found that}} his colleagues ruined his helmet and bought him a new one that was pink, the trio began making their way towards their next {{destination}} at the city of Nha Trang. Along the way, the trio encountered torrential rain, before May ran out of fuel {{and had to be}} aided by a local to refuel it, while Hammond's Minsk broke down after the clutch cable snapped and had to be repaired at a village along their route. At this point, the producers instigated a new rule that the bikes had to be repaired only with tools, after banning the trio from replacing parts on their bikes. They further added that if their bikes would not start, they would be forced to use an unappealing, and rather inappropriate vehicle - a 1973 Honda Chaly <b>mini-bike,</b> painted and flanked in a Stars and Stripes livery (similar to the bike seen in the film Easy Rider) and fitted with an iPod audio system continuously playing Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A."; both the iTunes and Netflix versions of the episode have the iPod playing [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Upon fixing Hammond's bike, the trio continued on toward Nha Trang and managed to reach it, despite difficulties in the downhill journey as night fell; Clarkson struggled the most after his headlight failed, and so was forced to strap a torch onto his bike to keep going.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mini-bike</b> drivers face a {{dangerous}} dilemma. In many states, these two-wheeled, gasoline-driven vehicles cannot be driven legally on streets or highways; in some locales, {{they are not}} allowed on sidewalks. Acceptable riding locations, such as yards or open fields, offer uneven or bumpy terrain that can cause a <b>mini-bike</b> to bounce or throw its rider. The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that more than 31, 000 persons each year require treatment in hospital emergency rooms for injuries related to mini-bikes.

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{exercise}} during hemodialysis {{has been a}} controversial issue, however, there are just few studies {{about the effect of}} active exercise during hemodialysis. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effects of passive and active intradialytic pedaling exercises on dialysis efficacy, electrolytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood pressure and health-related quality of life in hemodialysis patients. Patients and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 16 hemodialysis patients in Akhavan hemodialysis center in Kashan from April to November 2013. Active or passive intradialytic pedaling exercise was performed using a <b>Mini-Bike</b> for 30 minutes during the first two hours of the dialysis sessions. The quality of life (QOL) was assessed before and after the intervention. Blood pressure was examined at the beginning and then hourly during the dialysis sessions. Dialysis efficacy, levels of phosphorus, calcium, sodium, potassium and Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured {{at the end of the}} intervention. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, paired t test, Wilcoxon signed rank and Friedman tests and repeated measure analysis of variancewere used to analyze the data. Results: No significant changes were observed in serum potassium, phosphorus and calcium levels at the end of the passive exercise program compared to the baseline. However, phosphorus levels were significantly decreased in the active exercise program (P < 0. 05). Moreover, the mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased after the passive exercise (P = 0. 039). Passive exercise did not significantly change the dialysis efficacy, urea reduction rate, hemoglobin and calcium levels. The mean overall QOL was 63. 78 ± 21. 15 at the beginning of the study, which was increased to 77. 07 ± 21. 14 at the end of eight weeks of the intradialytic exercise (P = 0. 007). Conclusions: The passive intradialytic exercise had a positive effect on blood pressure. The active exercise could decrease the serum phosphorus and potassium levels. Moreover, both exercise programs could significantly improve the QOL. Both active and passive intradialytic exercises can have some beneficial effects...|$|E
