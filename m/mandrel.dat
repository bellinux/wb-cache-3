5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the <b>mandrel</b> and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|No. 5 Group RAF and No. 1 Group RAF {{committed}} 15 and 16 Avro Lancaster bombers to drop naval {{mines in}} Oslo harbour. Around 36 Mark IV and 54 Mark VI mines. One No. 1 Group Lancaster {{was shot down}} by a NJG 3 Ju 88 night fighter patrolling the Kattegat near Denmark; Major Werner Husemann achieved his 33rd air victory in this action which was confirmed through British records. No 1 Group claimed a victory against a Ju 88 in return. No. 11 Group sent 12 Handley Page Halifax bombers and four Short Stirlings which formed a <b>Mandrel</b> Screen to jam long-range Freya and Würzburg radar. They patrolled in orbit for 120 minutes over the North Sea. Meanwhile one Mosquito and seven Halifaxes from No. 192 Squadron RAF accompanied No. 4 Group to Kammen while monitoring enemy radio transmissions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} types of tube drawing: tube sinking, <b>mandrel</b> drawing, {{stationary}} <b>mandrel,</b> moving <b>mandrel,</b> and floating <b>mandrel.</b> A <b>mandrel</b> {{is used in}} many of the types to prevent buckling or wrinkling in the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The St. Georgen {{site was}} founded in 1980. It is a small, yet {{accomplished}} high-tech forge. In addition to standard clamping <b>mandrels,</b> mechanical or power-operated <b>mandrels,</b> sliding jaw <b>mandrels</b> and hydraulic <b>mandrels</b> for its customers for clamping workpieces in drill holes or inner contours are developed as tailor-made solutions {{for a wide range}} of different requirements.|$|R

40|$|An {{electroforming}} process {{developed for}} obtaining nickel shells of acceptable quality for structural tests is described. The discussion covers {{the composition of}} the plating bath, the preparation of aluminum <b>mandrels</b> (using silver as the releasing agent), the plating of aluminum <b>mandrels,</b> the removal of shells from aluminum <b>mandrels,</b> and the preparation of wax <b>mandrels.</b> The shell specimens obtained by these techniques have identical inner diameters, similar mechanical properties, and are free from residual or internal stresses. The variation of the shell thickness does not exceed 3 %. The samples obtained were 10 in. long, 0. 004 in. thick, and had an inner diameter of 5. 274 inches...|$|R
25|$|Fixed plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{stationary}} <b>mandrel</b> drawing, uses a <b>mandrel</b> {{at the end of}} the die to shape the ID of the tube. This process is slow and the area reductions are limited, but it gives the best inner surface finish of any of the processes. This is the oldest tube drawing method.|$|E
25|$|Tethered plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{semi-floating}} <b>mandrel</b> drawing, is a mix between floating plug drawing and fixed plug drawing. The <b>mandrel</b> is allowed to float, but it still anchored via a tether. This process gives similar results to the floating plug process, except that it is designed for straight tubes. It gives a better inner surface finish than rod drawing.|$|E
25|$|The major tools {{used by a}} {{glassblower}} are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or <b>mandrel),</b> bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and {{a variety}} of shears.|$|E
40|$|An {{assembly}} and method for manufacturing a composite reinforcement for unitizing a structure are provided. According to one embodiment, the assembly includes a base having {{a plurality of}} pins extending outwardly therefrom to define a structure about which a composite fiber is wound to define a composite reinforcement preform. The assembly also includes a plurality of <b>mandrels</b> positioned adjacent to the base {{and at least a}} portion of the composite reinforcement preform, and a cap that is positioned over at least a portion of the plurality of <b>mandrels.</b> The cap is configured to engage each of the <b>mandrels</b> to support the <b>mandrels</b> and the composite reinforcement preform during a curing process to form the composite reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|In {{support of}} the Constellation X mission the Optics Branch at Goddard Space Flight Center is {{developing}} technology for precision figuring and polishing of <b>mandrels</b> used to produce replicated mirrors {{that will be used}} in X-Ray telescopes. Employing a specially built machine controlled in 2 axes by a computer, we are doing automated polishing/figuring of 15 cm long, 20 cm diameter cylindrical, conical and Wolter <b>mandrels.</b> A battery of tests allow us to fully characterize all important aspects of the <b>mandrels,</b> including surface figure and finish, mid-frequency errors, diameters and cone angle. Parts are currently being produced with surface roughnesses at the. 5 nm RMS level, and half-power diameter slope error less than 2 arcseconds...|$|R
25|$|Tube {{drawing is}} very similar to bar drawing, except the {{beginning}} stock is a tube. It is used to decrease the diameter, improve surface finish and improve dimensional accuracy. A <b>mandrel</b> {{may or may not be}} used depending on the specific process used.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cylinder}} phonographs used a belt to {{turn the}} mandrel; slight slippage of this belt could make the <b>mandrel</b> turn unevenly, thus resulting in pitch fluctuations. Disc phonographs using a direct system of gears turned more evenly; the heavy metal turntable of disc machines acted as a flywheel, helping to minimize speed wobble.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped <b>mandrel,</b> and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a <b>mandrel.</b> A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene and {{polyolefin}} pellets are extruded {{and combined}} {{to create a}} molten polymer, which consists of a 37.5µm thick polypropylene sheet sandwiched between two 0.1µm polyolefin sheets, creating a thin film 37.7µm thick. This is gravity fed through a snap cooling brass <b>mandrel,</b> reheater, blown into a large bubble using air pressure and temperature, and collapsed {{at the base of}} the four-storey chamber into a flat sheet by convergence rollers, and the sheet is then slit. This creates the base biaxially-oriented polypropylene substrate of 75.4µm thickness, called ClarityC by Innovia Films.|$|E
25|$|Electrotyping {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. Electrotyping and electroforming both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. Electroforming involves {{the production of a}} metallic part around a metallic <b>mandrel,</b> although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, electrotyping forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a thin coating of graphite or metal powder.|$|E
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered <b>mandrel</b> is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This <b>mandrel</b> forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

This paper explores what we know (and need to know) about the hydrodynamics of the microencapsulation process in order to lay the foundation for process improvements as well as identify inherent limits...|$|R
25|$|The {{method by}} which Glock barrels are rifled is {{somewhat}} unusual; instead of using a traditional broaching machine to cut the rifling into the bore, the Glock process involves beating a slowly rotating <b>mandrel</b> through the bore to obtain the hexagonal or octagonal shape. As a result, the barrel's thickness {{in the area of}} each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a <b>mandrel</b> (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
25|$|Competitive pole {{vaulting}} {{began using}} solid ash poles. As the heights attained increased, the bamboo poles {{gave way to}} tubular aluminum, which was tapered at each end. Today's pole vaulters benefit from poles produced by wrapping pre-cut sheets of fiberglass that contains resin around a metal pole <b>mandrel,</b> to produce a slightly curved pole that bends more easily under the compression caused by an athlete's take-off. The shape of the fiberglass sheets {{and the amount of}} fiberglass used is carefully planned to provide the desired length and stiffness of pole. Different fiber types, including carbon-fiber, are used to give poles specific characteristics intended to promote higher jumps. In recent years, carbon fiber has been added to the commonly used E-glass and S-glass materials to create a lighter pole.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} Tailorable Advanced Blanket Insulation (TABI) flat panels for Advanced Space Transportation Systems were produced. Both types {{consisted}} of integrally woven, 3 -D fluted core having parallel faces and connecting ribs of Nicalon yarns. The triangular cross section flutes of one type {{was filled with}} <b>mandrels</b> of processed Ultrafiber (aluminoborosilicate) stitchbonded Nextel 440 fibrous felt, and the second type wall filled with Saffil alumina fibrous felt insulation. Weaving problems were minimal. Insertion of the fragile insulation <b>mandrels</b> into the fabric flutes was improved by using a special insertion tool. An {{attempt was made to}} weave fluted core fabrics from Nextel 440 yarns but was unsuccessful because of the yarn's fragility. A small sample was eventually produced by an unorthodox weaving process and then filled with Saffil insulation. The procedures for setting up and weaving the fabrics and preparing and inserting insulation <b>mandrels</b> are discussed. Characterizations of the panels produced are also presented...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1889, {{prerecorded}} wax cylinders were marketed. These have professionally made {{recordings of}} songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickel-in-the-slot machines—the first juke boxes—installed in arcades and taverns, {{but within a}} few years private owners of phonographs were increasingly buying them for home use. Each cylinder can easily be placed on and removed from the <b>mandrel</b> of the machine used to play them. Unlike later, shorter-playing high-speed cylinders, early cylinder recordings were usually cut at a speed of about 120 rpm and can play for as long as 3 minutes. They were made of a relatively soft wax formulation and would wear out after they were played a few dozen times. The buyer could then use a mechanism which left their surfaces shaved smooth so new recordings could be made on them.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding <b>mandrel).</b> Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating <b>mandrel.</b> A fixed <b>mandrel,</b> also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating <b>mandrel,</b> also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the <b>mandrel</b> before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the <b>mandrel</b> independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the <b>mandrel</b> in the die and have [...] "legs" [...] that hold the <b>mandrel</b> in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.|$|E
