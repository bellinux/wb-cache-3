5|$|On 17 April 1948, {{locomotive}} No. 6251 City of Nottingham was hauling a <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> {{which was}} in a rear-end collision with a passenger train at Winsford, Cheshire. In the first major accident for the newly formed British Railways, 24 {{people were killed and}} thirty injured.|$|E
5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> on Sundays. Traffic was to increase from 1901 {{with the opening of}} the Wrington Vale Light Railway. Although this line joined the Cheddar Valley Line at , most services continued to Yatton. In 1901 there were four passenger trains per day and one goods train, which increased to five passenger trains per day by 1903. The line was known for the transport of mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Yatton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, a stop was added at Yatton for a Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>train</b> {{to provide a more}} direct link to Bristol Airport. The service was ended in 2004 when the post office stopped transporting mail by train. When the railways were privatised in 1997, local services at Yatton were franchised to Wales & West, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, which was rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Important {{features}} {{incorporated in}} the line include four loops (spirals) and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for {{the replacement of the}} basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling <b>Mail</b> <b>train.</b> The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E

The first <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> ran in 1830, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Post Office's money order system was introduced in 1838.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 1976 {{the biggest}} train robbery in Irish history {{took place at}} Wheatfield. Eight men in {{fluorescent}} jackets used emergency signals to stop the <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> bound from Cork to Dublin and escaped with £600,000 in small denomination notes. The incident became the centre of a celebrated miscarriage of justice case, known mistakenly as the Sallins Train Robbery case after the nearest rail station then open, when three men were wrongly convicted of the robbery.|$|E
500|$|A similar crash {{occurred}} at Lawrence Hill on 1 November 2000, when a Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>train</b> passed two red signals {{and ran into}} the back of a coal train at around 3:30am. The <b>mail</b> <b>train,</b> hauled by English Welsh & Scottish [...] diesel locomotive number 67002 [...] "Special Delivery", with 67012 at the rear, was travelling at 50mph when the incident occurred. The locomotive climbed over the back of the coal train, coming to rest [...] later on top of a coal wagon and against the A420 Church Road bridge. The driver of the <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> suffered a broken arm and cuts to the face and chest, but there were no other injuries. The incident was initially suspected to be caused by faulty brakes, but was later found to be caused by misunderstanding and incorrect use of the locomotive's BPPCUIC cock by railway staff.|$|E

500|$|The paramilitaries {{also held}} up Russian {{currency}} transports leaving Polish territories. On {{the night of}} 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg. Piłsudski, {{who took part in}} this Bezdany raid near Vilnius, used the funds thus [...] "expropriated" [...] to finance his secret military organization. The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.|$|E
500|$|The {{temporary}} track over Rockfish Gap {{was used}} until the Blue Ridge Tunnel's opening in April 1858, {{and the last}} train to use the temporary track did so {{on the evening of}} April 12. [...] That night, the connection with the completed Blue Ridge Railroad was made, and {{on the morning of the}} 13th, the <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> was the first train routed through the tunnel. [...] With the tunnel in use, the temporary track was promptly torn up. [...] At the time of the Blue Ridge Tunnel's completion, it was the longest tunnel in the United States and the first tunnel in the country to be completed without the use of vertical shafts. [...] Although the Virginia Central did not own the Blue Ridge Railroad, it was granted the right to operate it from the Commonwealth of Virginia in return for an annual fee.|$|E

500|$|On 28 December 1879, {{the regular}} engine for the 1.30 p.m. <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> from Dundee to Burntisland (no. 89 Ladybank of the 88 Class, an 0-4-2T) failed, and no. 224 (which was based at Dundee, and spare at the time) was {{called out to}} work the train. It did so without {{incident}} on the southbound run, but when working the 5.20 p.m. northbound service later in the day, due to arrive at Dundee a little before 7.30, {{it was on the}} Tay Bridge when shortly after 7.13 p.m. the latter collapsed. The driver, David Mitchell, and [...] "stoker" [...] (fireman), John Marshall, of no. 224 had no warning of the impending disaster, and neither closed the regulator nor applied the brakes; they were among the 75 persons killed. Despite the fall, the locomotive was relatively undamaged, being protected by the bridge girders which formed a cage around the train as they fell together.|$|E
500|$|The wooden station {{building}} at Waterloo was a [...] from the Aberdeen and Deeside's Guild Street station and passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid {{for in the}} through fare and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The Great North refused to hold its trains to connect with those arriving at Guild Street and insisted that tickets were purchased at least five minutes before the train was due to depart. The <b>mail</b> <b>train</b> would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. This inconvenienced passengers, as was pointed out to the general manager during a parliamentary committee meeting by a Member of Parliament who had missed a connection, although his family and luggage had been sent on. The Great North promoted onward traffic by sea and approached the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company to see if rates could be reduced for through traffic and through ticketing by rail was not available until 1859, when the Great North joined the Railway Clearing House.|$|E
