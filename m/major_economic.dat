5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> crisis.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis was a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> and political event in Iceland {{that involved the}} default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history. The crisis led to a severe economic depression in 2008–2010 and significant political unrest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> centres are Moscow, Minsk and Astana. The {{distance}} between Moscow and Minsk is 717 kilometers, and the {{distance between}} Moscow and Astana is 2700 kilometers, making infrastructure a key challenge for the integration of member states. Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise and connect the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region. In 2007 Moscow announced it will invest 1 trillion USD by 2020 to modernise the country's infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is the <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> and {{financial}} centre of Denmark. The city's economy is {{based largely on}} services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show {{that the vast majority}} of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2010, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of €88,366 million, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.|$|E

5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war the Texas economy declined for a period. Nevertheless, ranching interests became <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> drivers in the area spawning many other economic enterprises such as hide processing plants and shipping concerns. The success of these enterprises and the growth of Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway; and the La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad through the area {{over the course of the}} 19th century. These railroads running along the southwest shore of the bay would spawn new communities such as Clear Creek (League City), Webster, and later Texas City.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, Plymouth has {{experienced}} rapid growth and development. As in many South Shore towns, Plymouth became {{more accessible to}} Boston in the early 1970s with improved railroads, highways, and bus routes. Furthermore, the town's inexpensive land costs and low tax rates were factors in the town's significant population rise. Plymouth's population grew from 18,606 residents in 1970 to 45,608 residents in 1990, a 145% increase in 20 years. The population has continued to expand in recent years. While Plymouth has already surpassed several Massachusetts cities in population, the town is still officially regarded as a town, as {{it has not been}} re-chartered as a city and continues to be governed by a board of selectmen rather than a mayor. Plymouth has emerged as a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> and tourist center of the South Shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the south shore}} region of Lake Erie was a popular {{vacation}} destination for the emerging middle class in the United States. The lake's islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts. The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen leased land and built living quarters there. Sandusky, which featured an important shipping harbor and two railroads, transformed into a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> center {{over the next three}} decades. Railroad and steamship travel supported an emerging tourism industry, and rapid development of the area began.|$|E
5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, {{their numbers are}} low, {{and they do not}} pose a <b>major</b> <b>economic</b> threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E
