[...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We know what the goal is and we {{are trying to figure out}} effective ways to slow down or prevent it".|$|E

2500|$|Following promotional {{work for}} the second Kid Creole and the Coconuts album Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places, Darnell gave an {{interview}} to the UK music magazine Melody Maker in December 1981 in which he spoke enthusiastically of the forthcoming solo album he was planning called Wise Guy, and told the magazine about three songs he already had written for the record titled [...] "I'm a Wonderful Thing", [...] "Stool Pigeon" [...] (originally titled [...] "Jive Talking") and [...] "Imitation". When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned out how he had wanted: [...] "Make no <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album. But because of the problems we ran into in the [...] company, and the company not believing in Kid Creole enough, this had to be turned into a Kid Creole album." ...|$|E

Now, {{it is most}} {{important}} that you should convince yourselves of and fully enter into this truth, because all the difficulty in choosing subject arises from <b>mistakes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I daresay some {{of you who are}} fond of sketching have gone out often in the most beautiful country, and yet with the feeling that there was no good subject to be found in it. That always arises from your not having sympathy enough with its vital character, and looking for physical picturesqueness instead. On the contrary, there are crude efforts at landscape-painting, made continually upon the most splendid physical phenomena, in America, and other countries without any history. It is not of the slightest use. Niagara, or the North Pole and the Aurora Borealis, won't make a landscape; but a ditch at Iffley will, if you have humanity in you--enough in you to interpret the feelings of hedgers and ditchers, and frogs.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIf {{the use of}} the {{apostrophe}} {{in contemporary}} English often marks the Saxon genitive, it may also indicate the omission of one or more let-ters. Some writers (wrongly?) use it to mark the plural in symbols or abbreviations, visual-ised thanks to the isolation of the morpheme “s”. This punctuation mark was imported from the Continent in the 16 th century. During the 19 th century its use was standardised. However the rules of its usage still seem problematic to many, including literate speakers of English. “All too often, the apostrophe is misplaced”, or “errant apostrophes are springing up every-where” is a complaint that Internet users fre-quently come across when visiting grammar websites. Many of them detail its various uses and misuses, and attempt to correct the most common <b>mistakes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> especially its mis-use in the plural, called greengrocers' apostro-phes and humorously misspelled “greengro-cers apostrophe's”. While studying English travel accounts published in the seventeenth century, we noticed that the different uses of this symbol may accompany various models of metaplasms. We were able to highlight the linguistic variations of some lexemes, and trace the origin of modern grammar rules gov-erning its usage...|$|R

40|$|Potentially all Japanese nouns are under-specified {{with respect}} to number and countability. To ask a user to interactively disambiguate each one is not feasible, {{and it can be}} {{impossible}} for a native speaker to do. Therefore it is important to disambiguate automatically. In addition, even if the system makes a <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> number, <b>it</b> is rarely fatal. There are some ambiguities involved with the use of classifiers that {{are more likely to be}} serious and require world knowledge such as 500 -gm-no ringo which could mean either a 500 gm apple or 500 gm of apple(s). It may be appropriate to ask for user input to disambiguate such examples, although it may be preferable to query a knowledge base first.
