40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the actual situation of maternal distress regarding 1 -year-old infant s cries. 　A self-completed questionnaire survey was performed 1 year after birth among 305 mothers who gave birth to term infants at maternity hospitals in the Hokuriku region. The survey content included : state of infant cries (characteristics of the cry and frequency, occurrence of crying at night, and the period when cries at night were observed), <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> sleeping condition and health condition, status of night feeding, support, feelings of mothers, and period when mothers began to understand {{the reasons for the}} infant s cries. In this study, the frequency of maternal distress regarding infant s crying was converted to a score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of distress related to crying. The number of valid responses was 251 (rate of valid response, 82. 3 %). One hundred eighty-five mothers reported night crying (73. 7 %), and night crying occurred most often around 6 to 8 months. The period when mothers felt they understood the reasons for the infant s cries was at 7 to 8 months in the majority of cases, and 1 year at the latest. At 1 year after birth, only approximately 20 % of mothers reported feelings of distress related to crying. The results indicated that maternal distress associated with child crying is related to nuclear family, presence of someone to talk to about childcare, characteristics of infant <b>s</b> cry, <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> health condition, and <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> feelings toward childcare. １年児の泣きとその母親の泣きに対する困難感の実態を明らかにすることを目的とし た。 　北陸地方の病産院にて正期産児を出産した母親３０５名を対象に、出生後１年時に、自己記 入式質問紙調査を実施した。調査内容は、児の泣きの状態（泣き方の特徴や頻度、夜泣き の有無と夜泣きの時期等）、母親の睡眠・健康状態、夜間の授乳状況、サポート状況、児が 泣いた時の母親の気持ちや泣きの理由がわかるようになった時期などである。本研究にお いては、児が泣くと戸惑う母親の頻度を得点化し、得点が高いほど、泣きに対する困難感 が高いと解釈した。有効回答は２５１名（有効回答率８２３. %）であった。乳児の夜泣きは、１８５ 名（７３７. ％）の母親にみられ、夜泣きの時期は６～８ヶ月頃が最も多かった。母親が児の泣 きの理由がわかるようになったと感じる時期は、大部分が７～８ヶ月頃から遅くとも１年 までであった。１年時においては、泣きに対して戸惑う母親は２割程度であった。泣きに 対する母親の困難感には、核家族、子育て相談者の存在、児の泣きの特性、母親の健康状態、 育児に対する母親の気持ちやなどが関連していることが明らかとなった。[原著:Originals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prevalence}} of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in relation to variables such as: age, weight, height, <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> education, number of family members, and nutritional habits among female elementary school children (age 6 - 12 years) in the western province of Saudi Arabia. A total of 123 female children were selected for this study. Complete blood count, serum iron, ferritin and total iron binding capacity were measured to assess iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Overall, the prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in this study was 23. 0 %. Data showed that the majority of anemia cases in this study were normocytic type. Anemia was more prevalent among students of age 10 - 12 years as compared to younger age group. In addition, there was no relationship between iron deficiency anemia and number of family members or <b>mother</b> <b>s</b> education. Anemic students were not aware of their nutritional habits. It was concluded that iron deficiency anemia is a problem among young girls, especially among those of age 12 years in western region of Saudi Arabia. It is recommended that the iron-folate supplementation program for pregnant women be expanded to non-pregnant women, including young girls...|$|R
