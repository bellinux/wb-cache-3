5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or <b>mobbing</b> a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. <b>Mobbing</b> is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. <b>Mobbing</b> is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit <b>mobbing</b> when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Mob</b> {{proteins}} from distantly related eukaryotic species share {{very high}} sequence similarity {{and they are}} charac-teristic of a conserved <b>Mob</b> domain with around 180 amino-acid residues in length. However, the evolutionary relation-ship of <b>mob</b> family genes has not been extensively investigated. Through a phylogenetic approach, we have conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the <b>mob</b> gene family. Here we show that over 270 <b>mob</b> family members from pro-tists to animals can be organized in four distinct groups. This classification is strongly supported by the analysis of <b>mob</b> exon-intron structures. Moreover, the conservation and divergence patterns of different groups of <b>Mob</b> proteins have been elucidated. Structural information and the identification of fixed amino acid substitutions provide evidence about the puta-tive significance of specific residues in the structural integrity and/or molecular functions of <b>Mob</b> proteins. Thus, this study reveals the evolutionary history of <b>mob</b> gene family and provides a basis for functional studies of <b>Mob</b> proteins...|$|R
40|$|In landfill-cover soils, aerobic methane-oxidizing {{bacteria}} (<b>MOB)</b> convert CH 4 to CO 2, mitigating {{emissions of}} the greenhouse gas CH 4 to the atmosphere. We investigated overall <b>MOB</b> community structure and assessed spatial differences in <b>MOB</b> diversity, abundance and activity in a Swiss landfill-cover soil. Molecular cloning, terminal restriction-fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and quantitative PCR of pmoA genes were applied to soil collected from 16 locations at three different depths to study <b>MOB</b> community structure, diversity and abundance; <b>MOB</b> activity was measured in the field using gas push-pull tests. The <b>MOB</b> community was highly diverse but dominated by Type Ia <b>MOB,</b> with novel pmoA sequences present. Type II <b>MOB</b> were detected mainly in deeper soil with lower nutrient and higher CH 4 concentrations. Substantial differences in <b>MOB</b> community structure were observed between one high- and one low-activity location. <b>MOB</b> abundance was highly variable across the site [4. 0 × 104 to 1. 1 × 107 (g soil dry weight) - 1]. Potential CH 4 oxidation rates were high [1. 8 - 58. 2 mmol CH 4 (L soil air) - 1 day- 1] but showed significant lateral variation and were positively correlated with mean CH 4 concentrations (P < 0. 01), <b>MOB</b> abundance (P < 0. 05) and <b>MOB</b> diversity (weak correlation, P < 0. 17).

Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with the serpent eagle.

D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is thought}} to be monogamous, though its {{breeding}} habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, <b>mobbing</b> and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator <b>mobbing,</b> mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store <b>mobbing</b> similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E

5000|$|Crowds can {{be active}} (<b>mobs)</b> or passive (audiences).

5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or <b>mobbing</b> techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and <b>mobbing</b> of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and <b>mobbing,</b> or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given {{in response to the}} calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus). The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. Superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a purr while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{completion}} of cytokinesis requires abscission of the midbody, a microtubule-rich cytoplasmic bridge {{that connects the}} daughter cells before their final separation. Although it has been established that both the midbody structure and membrane fusion are essential for abscission, the biochemical machinery and the cellular processes of abscission remain ill-defined. Here we report that human <b>Mob</b> 1 A and <b>Mob</b> 1 B proteins {{are involved in the}} regulation of abscission of the intercellular bridge. The <b>Mob</b> family is a group of highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, described as binding partners as well as co-activators of protein kinases of the Ndr family, and as members of the Hippo pathway. We show that depletion of <b>Mob</b> 1 A and <b>Mob</b> 1 B by RNAi causes abscission failure as a consequence of hyper-stabilization of microtubules in the midbody region. Interestingly, depleting <b>Mob</b> 1 also increases cell motility after cytokinesis, and induces prolonged centriole separation in G 1 phase. In contrast, centrosomes fail to split when either <b>Mob</b> 1 A or <b>Mob</b> 1 B is overexpressed. Our findings indicate that human <b>Mob</b> 1 proteins are involved in the regulation of microtubule stability at the midbody.

5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when <b>mobbing</b> them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|Deinonychus fossils {{have been}} {{uncovered}} {{in small groups}} near {{the remains of the}} herbivore Tenontosaurus, a larger ornithischian dinosaur. This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurids hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals. However, not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive, and a subsequent study published in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the Deinonychus may have actually displayed a disorganized <b>mobbing</b> behavior. Modern diapsids, including birds and crocodiles (the closest relatives of dromaeosaurids), display minimal long-term cooperative hunting (except the aplomado falcon and Harris's Hawk); instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, join forces time to time to increase hunting success, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where conflict often occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and might attack smaller Komodo dragons that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal dies, it is usually cannibalized. When this information is applied to the sites containing putative pack-hunting behavior in dromaeosaurids, it appears somewhat consistent with a Komodo dragon-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts that may have been eaten by other Deinonychus, which a study by Roach et al. presented as evidence against the idea that the animals cooperated in the hunt.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated <b>mobbing</b> of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
