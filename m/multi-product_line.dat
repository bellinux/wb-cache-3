We analyse the performance of multi-product lines that consist a number of machines and bounded buffers with preselected base stock levels.

The network is operated under a surplus-based production control policy {{in the presence of}} perturbations and production demand fluctuations. We derive bounds on the demand tracking accuracy for each product type, regardless its flow direction in the <b>multi-product</b> <b>line.</b> In addition, for a <b>multi-product</b> <b>line</b> with unidirectional product flow, we obtain a quantitative relation between demand tracking accuracy, its inventory levels, numbers of product types, buffer capacity limits and perturbations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{focus on}} the {{behaviour}} of a <b>multi-product</b> batch production <b>line</b> with fixed capacity which is scheduled according to inaccurate inventories (IRI). We assume an unlimited supply of raw materials and a constant demand for the different finished goods. The ordering policy of this production line {{is based on a}} (Q,R) continuous review, lost-sales inventory model and on given priority for each product using the same production line. Simulation modelling is proposed to investigate the relationship between the quality of service, safety stock and inventory inaccuracy under demand variations for each product. It is shown that the service-level quality is a non-monotone function of the inaccuracy rate, i. e. the service-level quality increases twice up to an IRI’s level and decreases after. This unusual phenomenon has been observed which goes against certain empirical practices in the SMEs that safety stock is only necessary for certain intervals of data inaccuracy rate.

40|$|Evolving large-scale, {{complex and}} highly {{variable}} systems {{is known to}} be a difficult task, where a single change can ripple through various parts of the system with potentially undesirable effects. In the case of product lines, and moreover multi-product lines, a change may affect only certain variants or certain combinations of features, making the evaluation of change effects more difficult. In this paper, we present an approach for computing the impact of a fea- ture change on the existing configurations of a <b>multi-product</b> <b>line,</b> using partial information regarding constraints between feature models. Our approach identifies the configurations that can no longer be derived in each individual feature model taking into account feature change impact propagation across feature models.

40|$|Most modern {{software}} {{systems can}} be adjusted to satisfy sets of conflicting requirements issued by different groups of users, based on their intended usage or execution context. For systems where configurations are a core concern, specific implementation mechanisms are {{put in place to}} allow the instantiation of sets of tailored components. Among those, we find selection processes for code artefacts, variability-related annotation in the code, variability models representing the available features and their allowed combina- tions. In such systems, features, or units of variability, are scattered across the aforementioned types of artefacts. Maintenance and enhancement of existing systems remain a challenge today, for all types of software systems. But in the case of variant-rich systems, engineers face an additional challenge due to the complexity of the product instantiation mechanisms: the maintenance of the variability model of the system, the complex build mechanisms, and fine-grained variability in the source code. The evolution of the system should be performed such that the information contained within the various artefacts remains consistent. In practice, this means that as the implementation of the system evolves, so should the mechanisms put in place to generate tailored products. Little information is available regarding changes occurring in such systems. To efficiently support such developers tasks and ease maintenance and enhancements activities, we need a deep understanding of the changes that take place in such systems. The state of the art provides trends over long period of times, highlighting systems growth - such as number of added or removed features in each release, or the evolution of cross- tree constraints in a variability model. While important to describe the core dynamics behind the evolution of a system, this does not provide information on the changes per- formed by developers leading to such trends. Similarly, this global information cannot be leveraged to facilitate developers’ activities. The focus of this thesis is the acquisition and usage of change information regard- ing variant-rich system evolution. We show how the information lacking from today’s state-of-the-art can be obtained from variant-rich system change history. We propose a set of tool-supported approaches designed to gather such information and show how we leverage change information for change impact analysis, or to derive knowledge on developer practices and the challenges they face during such operations. With this work, we shed new light on change scenarios involving heterogeneous artefacts regarding their nature as well as their prevalence in the evolution of such complex systems, and change impact analysis in variant-rich systems. We designed a model-based approach to extract feature related changes in heterogeneous artefacts. With such an approach, we can gather detailed information of feature evolution in all relevant artefacts. We created an approach for <b>multi-product</b> <b>line</b> modelling for impact computation. We leverage variability information to produce a collection of inter-related variability models, and show how to use it for targeted feature- change impact analysis on available capabilities of the product family. By applying our change extraction approaches on the Linux kernel, we were able to empirically characterise the evolution of the variability model of this system. We showed that the variability model of that system evolves mostly through modification of existing features, rather than through additions and removals. Similarly, we studied co-evolution of artefacts dur- ing feature evolution in the Linux kernel. Our study revealed that, in this system, most features evolve mostly through their implementation, and complex changes, involving heterogeneous artefacts are not the most frequent. Through this work, we provide detailed information on the evolution of a system, namely the Linux kernel, and the means used to obtain this information. We show that the gathered data allow us to reflect on the evolution of such a system, and we argue that gathering such information on any system is a source of valuable information regarding a system architecture. To this end, all tools developed {{in the context of this}} study were made available to the public. In this work, we provide key information on the evolution of the Linux kernel, as well as the means to obtain the same information from other variant-rich systems. The knowledge gained on common evolution scenarios is critical for tool developers focus- ing on the support of development of variant-rich systems. A better understanding of common evolution scenario also allows engineers to design systems that will be better equipped to elegantly evolve through such scenarios. While a number of challenges will still have to be addressed in this domain, this work constitutes a step toward a better understanding of variant-rich system evolution and therefore toward better variant-rich system designs. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Managing the {{variation}} in task processing time has been a critical problem in manufacturing systems design. We present three research papers for systematic evaluation and handling manufacturing time variations. The manufacturing time variations addressed in the first paper are product-change dependent variations in task times and inter-task times in <b>multi-product</b> manufacturing <b>lines</b> with known production schedule. The problem of unexpected variations in manufacturing times is addressed {{in the second and}} third papers. The first paper of this study is focused on incorporating non-value added activities, namely inter-task times, in optimal configuration of <b>multi-product</b> manufacturing <b>lines.</b> The contribution of this paper includes explicit consideration of intra-model inter-task times in station times, optimal assignment of tasks to stations for increased task recurrence between different product models, analysis of batch size effect on station time variation, and selection of machine types according to the flexibility of stations. In the second paper, a moderate robust optimization approach is implemented for systematic evaluation of buffer times in synchronous manufacturing lines. The effect of conservatism level on the minimum cycle time at the bottleneck station and the required buffer time in each station is analyzed. The non-productive time in each station is characterized based on its effect on handling task time variations. The efficiency of the robust optimization approach based on {{the variation}} level of uncertain times is verified. The third paper represents the work-sharing approach for managing task time variations in the bottleneck station of synchronous manufacturing lines. The stochastic Chance-Constrained models of this paper provide sufficient pure idle time in the immediate downstream station to finish the incomplete work form the overloaded bottleneck station. The approaches of the third paper prevent extra cost of utility workers for offline completion of incomplete work. Moreover, the probability of line stoppage due to overload in the bottleneck station is reduced and the cycle time is minimized with the utilization of work-sharing approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Flow {{line are}} one of the most {{commonly}} en-countered layouts in manufacturing industries, where several product types (grades) are manufactured using a sequence of sub-systems or machinery with different tasks. With increasing prices of energy and specific customer demands employing effective product scheduling strategies has become essential for manufacturing industries to maintain their business viability. In this paper, a new product scheduling method is proposed for multi-machine, <b>multi-product</b> flow <b>lines.</b> The objective here is to control the production start time for each grade so that the product delivery time errors are minimised. It is also desired to minimise the overall makespan variability caused by non-Gaussian uncertainties formulated by the entropy of the de-livery time errors. Therefore, the proposed product scheduling strategy is a nonlinear multi-objective optimisation problem with non-Gaussian uncertainties. To solve this problem, the nonlinear dynamic flow line model is converted to a linear dynamic equivalent using a (Max,+) algebraic approach. Then, a Proportional-Integral (PI) scheduling controller is used to control the production start time for each grade. The scheduling controller coefficients are tuned by a Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique and a comparison is made between MODE, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). I...|$|R

For each position, the set of options for equipment which can be used to perform the corresponding sets ofoperations is given. The batch and selected equipment are invariable over all periods.

Design/methodology/approach: Discrete event simulation and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation approach were utilised to develop Pareto-frontier or sets of non-dominated optimal solutions and for selection of an appropriate decision set for the control parameters in the shared Kanban allocation policy (S-KAP) and dedicated Kanban allocation policy (D-KAP). Simulation experiments were carried out via ExtendSim simulation application software. The outcomes of PCS+KAP performances were compared via all pairwise comparison and Nelson’s screening and selection procedure for superior PCS+KAP under negligible environmental and system stability. To determine superior PCS+KAP under systems’ and environmental variability, the optimal solutions were tested for robustness using Latin hypercube sampling technique and stochastic dominance test. Findings: The outcome of this study shows that under uncontrollable environmental variability, dedicated Kanban allocation policy outperformed shared Kanban allocation policy in serial manufacturing system with negligible and in complex assembly line with setup times. Moreover, the BK-CONWIP is shown as superior strategy to HK-CONWIP. Research limitations/implications: Future research should be conducted to verify the level of flexibility of BK-CONWIP with respect to product mix and product demand volume variations in a complex multi-product system Practical implications: The outcomes of this work are applicable to multi-product manufacturing industries with significant setup times and systems with negligible setup times. The multi-objective optimisation provides decision support for selection of control-parameters such that operations personnel could easily change parameter settings to achieve a new service level without additional optimisations of the system parameters.

40|$|The {{production}} <b>line</b> {{of modern}} <b>multi-product</b> manufacturing with erratic demand profiles {{shows that the}} selection and implementation of appropriate production control strategy are an important challenge. Organisations that adopt pull-type production control strategies, such as Kanban control strategy, for <b>multi-product</b> production <b>lines</b> find {{that is necessary to}} plan high Kanban card allocations in order to maintain volume flexibility to manage demand variability. This can result in line congestion, long lead times and low throughput rate. A recently proposed shared Kanban allocation policy has the benefit of minimising inventories in the line by allocating Kanbans accordingly and therefore maintains volume flexibility. However, many pull production control strategies that {{have been shown to be}} successful in single product manufacturing environments, for instance Kanban, CONWIP and Basestock cannot operate the shared Kanban allocation policy naturally. This Thesis presents a practically applicable modification approach to enable pull production control strategies that are naturally unable to operate in a shared Kanban allocation policy mode to operate it. Furthermore, the approach enables the development of a new pull production control strategy referred to as Basestock Kanban CONWIP control strategy that has the capability to operate the shared Kanban allocation policy, minimising inventory and backlog while maintaining volume flexibility. To investigate the performance of the pull production control strategies and policies, discrete event simulation and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation approach were adopted to develop sets of non-dominated optimal solutions for the experiments. Nelson’s screening and selection procedure were used to select the best pull control strategy and Kanban allocation policy when robustness are not considered. Additionally, Latin hypercube sampling technique and stochastic dominance test were employed for selection of a superior policy and strategy under environmental and system variability. Under non-robust conditions (anticipated environmental and system variability), pull control strategies combined with the shared Kanban allocation policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with dedicated Kanban allocation policy. Conversely, pull control strategies combined with the dedicated Kanban allocation policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with shared Kanban allocation policy when the system is prone to environmental and system variabilities. Furthermore Basestock Kanban CONWIP control strategy outperforms the alternatives in both robust and non-robust conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Our work is {{motivated}} by real-world planning challenges faced by a manufacturer of industrial products. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we study a <b>multi-product</b> serial-flow production <b>line</b> that operates in a low-volume, long lead-time environment. The objective is to minimize variable operating costs, in the face of forecast uncertainty, raw material arrival uncertainty and in-process failure. We develop a dynamic-programming-based tactical model to capture the key uncertainties and trade-offs, and to determine the minimum-cost operating tactics. The tactics include smoothing production to reduce production-related costs, and segmenting the serial-flow line with decoupling buffers to protect against variance propagation. For each segment, we specify a work release policy and a production control policy to manage the work-in-process inventory within the segment and to maintain the inventory targets in the downstream buffer. We also optimize the raw material ordering policy with fixed ordering times, long lead-times and staggered deliveries. In the second part of the thesis, we examine a multi-product assembly system that operates in a high-volume, short lead- time environment. The operating tactics used here include determining a fixed-length cyclic schedule to control production, in addition to smoothing production and segmenting the system with decoupling buffers. We develop another dynamic-programming-based tactical model that determines optimal policies for production planning and scheduling, inventory, and raw material ordering; these policies minimize the operating cost for the system in the face of forecast and raw material arrival uncertainty. We tested these models on both hypothetical and actual factory scenarios. The results confirmed our intuition and also helped develop new managerial insights on the application of these operating tactics. Moreover, the tactical model's factory performance predictions were found to be within 10 % of simulation results for the testbed systems, thus validating the models. by Pallav Chhaochhria.
