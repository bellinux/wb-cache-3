To investigate the molecular events leading to the generation of <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> we first screened a panel of leukemic cells for rearrangement or amplification of known oncogenes or previously described specific integration sites. No modification of these genes was observed. Therefore, we searched for common integration sites by constructing a genomic library from a myeloblastic cell line harboring only five integrated proviruses. This library was screened with a virus-specific probe, and virus-host cellular junction fragments were subcloned. Two flanking cellular sequences corresponding to two different integrated proviruses were used to analyze additional <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> The first probe detected rearrangements in 2 of 42 <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and the second probe detected rearrangements in 6 of 42. We demonstrated that, in each case, the rearrangement was the result of F-MuLV integration, with all proviruses in the same orientation and clustering in a region less than 3 kilobases long. The two regions, named fim- 1 and fim- 2, were different from 15 oncogenes tested.

30|$|DNA intercalators inhibit DNA polymerases and topoisomerases, {{resulting}} in the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. DNA intercalating agents, such as amsacrine, actinomycin, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin, have been employed as anticancer drugs and are in routine clinical use as chemotherapeutic agents [11]. It is well accepted that the antitumor activity of doxorubicin {{is caused by the}} formation of a cleavable complex of topoisomerase II, {{resulting in}} apoptosis [12],[13]. Doxorubicin is indicated in the treatment of a broad spectrum of solid tumors (e.g. breast, bladder, endometrium, thyroid, lung, ovary, stomach, and sarcomas of the bone) and in the treatment of lymphoma, as well as acute lymphoblastic and <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias</b> [14]. One of the most important and clinically relevant side effects of doxorubicin is the induction of cardiomyopathy [15]. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect of doxorubicin, including oxidative stress [16], the induction of mitochondrial damage [17], and changes in gene expression in cardiac myocytes and muscle cells in general [18],[19].|$|R
40|$|Abstract BAG 3, {{a member}} of the BAG family of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 cochaperones, is {{expressed}} in response to stressful stimuli in a number of normal cell types and constitutively in a variety of tumors, including pancreas carcinomas, lymphocytic and <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and thyroid carcinomas. Down-regulation of BAG 3 results in cell death, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of BAG 3 -dependent survival in human osteosarcoma (SAOS- 2) and melanoma (M 14) cells. We show that bag 3 overexpression in tumors promotes survival through the NF-kappaB pathway. Indeed, we demonstrate that BAG 3 alters the interaction between HSP 70 and IKKgamma, increasing availability of IKKgamma and protecting it from proteasome-dependent degradation; this, in turn, results in increased NF-kappaB activity and survival. These results identify bag 3 as a potential target for anticancer therapies in those tumors in which this gene is constitutively expressed. As a proof of principle, we show that treatment of a mouse xenograft tumor model with bag 3 siRNA-adenovirus that down-regulates bag 3 results in reduced tumor growth and increased animal survival...|$|R

Prdm 16 deletion enhances apoptosis and cycling of HSCs. Expression analysis revealed that Prdm 16 regulates a remarkable number of genes that, based on knockout models, both enhance and suppress HSC function, and affect quiescence, cell cycling, renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis to various extents. These data suggest that Prdm 16 may be a critical node in a network that contains negative and positive feedback loops and integrates HSC renewal, quiescence, apoptosis, and differentiation...|$|R

Seven patients with C. septicum gangrene or sepsis {{have been treated}} at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the years 1977 - 79. All of these patients have had associated malignant disease: four patients had colon adenocarcinomas, two patients had acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and one patient had breast carcinoma.

These results suggest that, in the patient with C. septicum infection, malignancy should be sought; that, in the septic patient with known malignancy, C. septicum should be considered; and that, in the absence of external source in the patient with clostridial myonecrosis or sepsis, the cecum or distal ileum should be considered a likely site of infection.

We characterized {{a series of}} 378 consecutive patients with adult acute leukemia by using CC, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), and multiplex karyotyping (M-FISH) analysis. Our aim was to define the frequency of cryptic MLL+ cases and the frequency of MLL+ within 11 q 22 to approximately 25 + cases. As expected, FISH was more sensitive than CC in detecting MLL+ cases, but rather unexpectedly, 9 (45 %) of 20 patients with 11 q 22 to approximately 25 + were MLL-. A better characterization of 11 q 22 to approximately 25 +/MLL- leukemias is relevant for the identification of new, recurrent translocations. Moreover, these cases should be readily distinguishable from 11 q 23 +/MLL+ cases.

40|$|Stress-induced {{apoptosis}} regulates neoplasia pathogenesis {{and response}} to therapy. Indeed, cell transformation induces a stress response, that is overcome, in neoplastic cells, by alterations in apoptosis modulators; on the other hand, antineoplastic therapies largely trigger the apoptosis stress pathway, whose impairment results in resistance. Therefore, {{the study of the}} roles of apoptosis- modulating molecules in neoplasia development {{and response to}} therapy is of key relevance for our understanding of these processes. Among molecules that regulate apoptosis, a role is emerging for BAG 3, a member of the BAG co-chaperone protein family. Proteins that share the BAG domain are characterized by their interaction with a variety of partners (heat shock proteins, steroid hormone receptors, Raf- 1 and others), involved in regulating a number of cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. BAG 3, also known as CAIR- 1 or Bis, forms a complex with the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70. This assists polypeptide folding, can mediate protein delivery to proteasome and is able to modulate apoptosis by interfering with cytochrome c release, apoptosome assembly and other events in the death process. It has been recently shown that, in human primary lymphoid and <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias</b> and other neoplastic cell types, BAG 3 expression sustains cell survival and underlies resistance to therapy, through downmodulation of apoptosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Flow cytometry is {{nowadays}} {{the preferred}} method for immunophenotypic identification, enumeration and characterization of blast cells at diagnosis. Despite widespread application of standardized protocols, inter-laboratory reproducibility {{has still not}} been achieved. The complexity of diagnosis and evaluation of minimal residual disease, in immunophenotyping acute leukemia, demands {{the use of a}} test that provides all the necessary information. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: The information given here is derived from the experience of the authors and from literature files. The most relevant studies with adequate conclusions were considered. We report on the current status of multiparametric immunophenotyping using simultaneous three and four-color staining and the applications of this technique. RESULTS: Multiparametric immunophenotyping is a powerful method for achieving a clear discrimination between normal and pathologic cells. The specific identification of leukemic cells by immunologic gating forms the basis for immunophenotypic diagnosis, classification as well as prognostic evaluation of patients with acute leukemias. The performance of the procedure with regards to the panels of reagents and the analytic processes, is necessarily different in lymphoblastic and <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> since the diagnostic questions are different. Phenotypic information should be specifically provided for the blast cells and antigen expression should preferably be reported in quantitative units and CV. This would allow a standardized cross evaluation of immunophenotypic results between different investigators and laboratories. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent reports indicate that phenotypic aberrations reflect genetic abnormalities of leukemic cells and therefore their definition and identification is of clinical relevance not only for minimal residual disease monitoring but also for subclassifying acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) {{is regarded}} as a potential anticancer agent. However, many cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. The present study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: TRAIL/TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) expression and sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were explored in 79 AML patients, including 17 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). RESULTS: In non-APL AML we observed frequent expression of TRAIL decoy receptors (TRAIL-R 3 and TRAIL-R 4), while TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2 expression was restricted to AML exhibiting monocytic features. Total leukemic blasts, as well as AML colony-forming units (AML-CFU), were invariably resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. APL express membrane-bound TRAIL on their surface and exhibit a pattern of TRAIL-R expression similar to that observed in the other types of AML. Before, during and after retinoic acid treatment APL cells are TRAIL-resistant. The induction of granulocytic maturation of APL cells by retinoic acid was associated with a marked decline of TRAIL expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of experimental APL models (i. e., U 937 cells engineered to express PML/RAR-Eo and NB 4 cells) provided evidence that PML/RAR-Eo expression was associated with downmodulation of TRAIL-R 1 and with resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We suggest that AML blasts, including APL blasts, are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, a phenomenon seemingly related to the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors on these cells. Finally, APL blasts express membrane-bound TRAIL that could confer an immunologic privilege to these cells...|$|R

40|$|Low folate intake {{as well as}} {{alterations}} in folate metabolism {{as a result of}} polymorphisms in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) have been associated with an increased incidence of neural tube defects, vascular disease, and some cancers. Polymorphic variants of MTHFR lead to enhanced thymidine pools and better quality DNA synthesis that could afford some protection from the development of leukemias, particularly those with translocations. We now report associations of MTHFR polymorphisms in three subgroups of pediatric leukemias: infant lymphoblastic or <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias</b> with MLL rearrangements and childhood lymphoblastic leukemias with either TEL-AML 1 fusions or hyperdiploid karyotypes. Pediatric leukemia patients (n = 253 total) and healthy newborn controls (n = 200) were genotyped for MTHFR polymorphisms at nucleotides 677 (C→T) and 1, 298 (A→C). A significant association for carriers of C 677 T was demonstrated for leukemias with MLL translocations (MLL+, n = 37) when compared with controls [adjusted odd ratios (OR) = 0. 36 with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0. 15 – 0. 85; P = 0. 017]. This protective effect was not evident for A 1298 C alleles (OR = 1. 14). In contrast, associations for A 1298 C homozygotes (CC; OR = 0. 26 with a 95 % CI of 0. 07 – 0. 81) and C 677 T homozygotes (TT; OR = 0. 49 with a 95 % CI of 0. 20 – 1. 17) were observed for hyperdiploid leukemias (n = 138). No significant associations were evident for either polymorphism with TEL-AML 1 + leukemias (n = 78). These differences in allelic associations may point to discrete attributes of the two alleles in their ability to alter folate and one-carbon metabolite pools and impact after DNA synthesis and methylation pathways, but should be viewed cautiously pending larger follow-up studies. The data provide evidence that molecularly defined subgroups of pediatric leukemias have different etiologies and also suggest a role of folate in the development of childhood leukemia...|$|R

Its inhibition leads to a decrease of the HOXA 9 protein level but not of Hoxa 9 mRNA and to an over-recruitment of MOZ and MLL onto the HOXA 9 promoter.
