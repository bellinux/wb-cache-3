40|$|ABSTRACT bjectives: {{self-medication}} is {{a practice}} that has been widely discussed around the world, becoming the target of several studies, including Brazil. Self-medication can cause harm. Children and adolescents are the group most inclined to irrational use of medications. The present study aims to evaluate the behavior {{of high school students}} about self-medication. Methods: a cross-sectional sample of 79 high school teenagers, aged 14 - 18 years old of both genders. The questionnaire included the following variables: age, gender, grade, frequency of use of medications, who guided the consumption and self-medication, which were evaluated using dichotomous questions, specifying the(s) drug(s) used and their purpose. Results: the self-medication occurred in 96. 2 % of the sample, with no difference between genders (p = 0. 19) or age (p = 0. 61). Among those who self-medicated on their own, 55. 88 % based on old prescriptions. The most consumed pharmacological groups were analgesics, followed by medicines for colds or flu. Almost half (48. 1 %) participants reported using nonprescription medicines.  There was association between adolescents' self-medication and maternal self-medication (p = 0. 02). Conclusion: it is extremely worrying the large percentage of adolescents who engage in self-medication, in view of the potential health risks.

40|$|Aim.   This {{paper is}} a report of a study of how people’s {{experiences}} of transient ischaemic attack affect their perception of their health and their uptake of health maintenance measures. Background.   Transient ischaemic attack is a well-recognized warning sign of subsequent stroke, but early diagnosis and management of risk factors can substantially reduce this risk. Even though the physical effects of a transient ischaemic attack are transient, it is known to negatively affect quality of life. However, no qualitative studies have explored the impact of transient ischaemic attack on people’s everyday lives. Methods.   Sixteen participants were recruited from a vascular surgery clinic in a district general hospital in North West England. All had a recent transient ischaemic attack. A qualitative grounded theory study using detailed interviews (n = 21) was conducted. Findings.   Participants experienced conflict between acknowledgement of the transient ischaemic attack as a significant illness episode with implications for their long-term health, and denial of its seriousness. Although they often ignored the initial signs, participants also experienced fear due to increased awareness of their risk of stroke. Often, they {{believed that they were}} having a permanent stroke. Many participants were prompted to seek <b>medical</b> <b>advice</b> <b>by</b> a family member or acquaintance. Having a transient ischaemic attack negatively changed their perception of their health and their quality of life, but some also viewed it as a positive event that had warned of their stroke risk and enabled them to take up health maintenance measures. Conclusions.   Having a transient ischaemic attack permanently changes people’s quality of life and their perception of their health, despite the transience of the symptoms. The ability of people to make positive health changes after a transient ischaemic attack to some extent ameliorates the negative effects of being aware of their heightened stroke risk. Their appreciation of their quality of life may also be enhanced. The transience of the symptoms and lack of knowledge of transient ischaemic attacks lead to delays in seeking <b>medical</b> <b>advice...</b>|$|R

Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, methanol-poisoned patients admitted to departments of forensic medicine and toxicology of Loghman Hakim and Baharloo hospitals in Tehran during October 2010 to October 2011 were included; and their data were recorded in predesigned checklists. Results: Twenty-eight methanol poisoned patients (82. 1 % men) with mean age of 29. 3 ± 4. 6 years were studied. Most patients (67. 9 %) had metabolic acidosis at presentation. On admission, all patients had different degrees of decrease in consciousness, who the majority of them (57. 1 %) were admitted with mildly reduced consciousness (grade I of Grady coma scale). Headache and vertigo were observed in 7. 1 % and 17. 9 % of patients, respectively. Most patients (53. 6 %) had no ocular effects, while 46. 6 % of patients developed impaired vision. All patients received sodium bicarbonate. Ethanol as antidote and folic acid were given to 18 patients (64. 2 %) and 16 patients (57. 1 %), respectively.

AimTo describe and analyse the response of emergency physicians receiving calls for chest pain in the French Emergency Medical System. MethodsFrom 16 November to 13 December 2009, calls to the Medical Dispatch Centre for non-traumatic chest pain were included prospectively in a multicentre observational study.
