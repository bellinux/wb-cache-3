5000|$|Wooly Willy is [...] "a face {{printed on}} {{cardboard}} under a bubble of plastic filled with metal filings {{that could be}} moved with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand</b> to create features like beards, mustaches, and shaggy eyebrows on the face." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wooly Willy is a toy {{in which}} metal filings are moved about with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand</b> to add {{features}} to a cartoon face. [...] The toy was originally manufactured in Smethport, Pennsylvania and was launched on the toy market in 1955. It remains in production as of 2016.|$|R
25|$|Recently, an exact-scale HO {{model of}} the AAR coupler has been {{designed}} and manufactured by Frank Sergent. This design uses a tiny stainless steel ball to lock the knuckle closed. Uncoupling is achieved by holding a <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand</b> over the coupler pair to draw the balls out of the locking pockets.|$|R
500|$|Lucas {{stated the}} 3D re-release was [...] "just a conversion" [...] of the film's 2011 Blu-ray release and no {{additional}} changes were made. Only a change to Anakin's <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand</b> during the podrace sceneits tip was sharpened to more accurately fit the original 2D photography {{to the new}} 3D imagewas confirmed.|$|R

5000|$|Tickle Bee (1956) is a {{physical}} skill game for one player ages 3 and up. Components consist of a molded plastic maze covered with a clear plastic film, a metal [...] "bee" [...] confined within the maze, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand.</b> The game is won when the bee is guided through the maze without touching {{the tip of the}} wand.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{particles}} functionalised with anti-cotinine antibody {{have been}} used to image latent fingermarks through the detection of the cotinine antigen in the sweat deposited within the fingerprints of smokers. The antibodyâ€“magnetic particle conjugates are readily applied to latent fingerprints while excess reagents are removed {{through the use of a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>wand.</b> The results have shown that drug metabolites, such as cotinine, can be detected and used to image the fingermark to establish the identity of an individual within 15 minutes...|$|R
50|$|Puzzling Pyramid (1960) is a {{game for}} 2, 3 or 4 players of all ages. The object {{of the game is}} for each player to use a <b>magnetic</b> {{exploring}} <b>wand</b> to guide a steel ball up one of the four colored (yellow, red, green, blue) sides of a pyramid into a common treasure vault at the top. On the inside of each side of the pyramid, plastic tunnel blocks are placed by an opposing player {{before the start of the}} game, which are designed to impede the wand user's progress to the top, however at least one open path must be provided.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy has a {{large number}} of nuclear waste tanks. It is {{important}} to know if fissionable materials can concentrate when waste is transferred from staging tanks prior to feeding waste treatment plants. Specifically, there is a concern that large, dense particles, e. g., plutonium containing, could accumulate in poorly mixed regions of a blend tank heel for tanks that employ mixing jet pumps. At the request of the DOE Hanford Tank Operations Contractor, Washington River Protection Solutions, the Engineering Development Laboratory of the Savannah River National Laboratory performed a scouting study in a 1 / 22 -scale model of a waste tank to investigate this concern and to develop measurement techniques that could be applied in a more extensive study at a larger scale. Simulated waste tank solids and supernatant were charged to the test tank and rotating liquid jets were used to remove most of the solids. Then the volume and shape of the residual solids and the spatial concentration profiles for the surrogate for plutonium were measured. This paper discusses the overall test results, which indicated heavy solids only accumulate during the first few transfer cycles, along with the techniques and equipment designed and employed in the test. Those techniques include: Magnetic particle separator to remove stainless steel solids, the plutonium surrogate from a flowing stream; <b>Magnetic</b> <b>wand</b> used to manually remove stainless steel solids from samples and the tank heel; Photographs were used to determine the volume and shape of the solids mounds by developing a composite of topographical areas; Laser rangefinders to determine the volume and shape of the solids mounds; Core sampler to determine the stainless steel solids distribution within the solids mounds; Computer driven positioner that placed the laser rangefinders and the core sampler over solids mounds that accumulated on the bottom of a scaled staging tank in locations where jet velocities were low. These devices and techniques were very effective to estimate the movement, location, and concentrations of the solids representing plutonium and are expected to perform well at a larger scale. The operation of the techniques and their measurement accuracies will be discussed as well as the overall results of the accumulated solids test...|$|R
40|$|The papar examiuss {{applications}} {{and research on}} the use of bar code technology to aid mentally retarded, physically handicapped, visually impaired, and other handicapped persons in independently gaining information from a variety of sources. Bar code reader technology is compared to alternative information systems such as Braille, pictorial instruction, and cassette tapes. The "Magic <b>Wand</b> Speaking <b>Reader,</b> " intended to be used with Texas Instruments, Inc. 's "Talking Tracks " bar codes and a computer-aided bar code printing system, is described and diagrammed. Research on bar code technology is reviewed, including a needs survey, engineering performance evaluation of the "Magic Wand, " evaluation of the intelligibility of the synthesized speech, and successful use with bar coded recipes. Als, described is ongoing research in such areas as teaching first aid akills to retarded persons and use of bar coded dictionaries. Limitations of the technology, such as the precision needed for properly tracking the bar codes, are cited.
