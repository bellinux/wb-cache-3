50|$|For {{use with}} heavy loads (such as {{encountered}} by a milling <b>machine</b> <b>spindle),</b> {{there is usually}} a key to prevent rotation and/or a threaded section, which is engaged by a drawbar that engages either the threads or {{the head of a}} pull stud that is screwed into them. The drawbar is then tightened, drawing the shank firmly into the spindle. The draw-bar is important on milling machines as the transverse force component would otherwise cause the tool to wobble out of the taper.|$|E
