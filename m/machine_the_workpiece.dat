MRSEV Issues Page 1 1 Introduction 1. 1 MRSEVs In machining a metal part, successive cutting operations are generally carried out, each of which removes material from the workpiece. A method of specifying what to remove in each operation is required. It is sometimes feasible to use features on the design of the part to determine what material to machine away {{in order to make the}} part.

40|$|Back cutting is {{a special}} {{condition}} that occurs when there is tool run-out, uneven tool wear on the inserts or machining over the same region in opposite directions in two different passes. As the tool progresses along a tool path the instabilities mentioned might cause the back half of the cutter to <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>workpiece.</b> This condition is {{commonly referred to as}} back cutting. The most common way of observing the presence of back cutting is the reversal in the direction of tool marks. A series of experiments were performed to gauge the actual effect on process performance due to back cutting. The results surprisingly showed that back cutting does not have a serious impact on the burr formation. Pictures of burrs under an optical microscope shows that back cutting do not create burrs but merely machines over the burrs created from forward cutting. Experiments performed with different back cutting depths produced identical results. The study also revealed that the tool wear which causes nose rounding is the more significant cause of burrs not explained by prediction theories. Two different strategies, tool geometry based and tool path based are proposed to avoid kinematic conditions that promote burr formation with worn tools. The results from these strategies are presented {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|E

EDM works by eroding material in path of electrical discharges that form an arc between an electrode tool and the work piece. The objective of this thesis project is to determine effect of EDM jet flushing setting on the machining of tool steel workpiece. The most important parameters of EDM are the material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra). The non-electrical factors are considered in this experiment where the electrical factor has been fixed. In this thesis the influence of electrode material, flushing, electrode dimension and depth of cut on EDM performance is discussed. The analysis of the influence of these factors was carried out by adopting a complete factorial experiment.

40|$|Beta {{titanium}} alloys are increasingly attractive {{because of their}} superior combination of properties such as high strength and fracture toughness. These alloys are finding potential applications {{in the manufacture of}} aircraft components such as landing gear, springs and nacelles. Innovative machining solutions are required to reduce the cost of production of beta titanium components and improve cycle time. Previous research has reported that these alloys have poor machinability compared to the more common Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy. This paper aims to investigate the behaviour of the Ti- 6 Cr- 5 Mo- 5 V- 4 Al beta titanium alloy using laser assisted machining (LAM). The LAM technique utilises a laser beam which is applied onto the workpiece surface locally in front of the cutting tool in order to provide external heat to significantly reduce the yield strength of the material. This reduces the cutting forces required to <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> and increases metal removal rates. In this study, the effect of the laser beam on the cutting forces and cutting temperature is critically analysed over a wide range of feed rates and cutting speeds and is compared to the results obtained from conventional (un-assisted) machining of this beta titanium alloy. This investigation has shown that LAM significantly reduces cutting forces within a certain range of cutting parameters. Maximum benefit was achieved at feed rates between 0. 15 and 0. 25 mm/rev and cutting speeds between 25 and 100 m/min at a laser power of 1200 W during LAM of the Ti- 6 Cr- 5 Mo- 5 V- 4 Al beta titanium alloy...|$|E
40|$|High {{strength}} work {{materials have}} tremendous {{applications in the}} field of aerospace, nuclear, biomedical, automotive, etc. It is a challenging task to machine these high strength materials. Costly cutting tools are required to machine those materials. Hot machining is another alternative approach for hot machining those hard material using low cost cutting tools. Basic concept behind the hot machining is to soften the material by heating technique which reduces the shear strength of the workpiece as well as reduces the forces required to <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>workpiece</b> at the time of machining. In the present investigation, experimental investigation of hot machining operation has been carried out using flame heating for machining high manganese steel using ordinary carbide insert. Hot machining operation has been investigated to study the advantages of hot machining operation over conventional machining operation. Tool wear, surface roughness, chip reduction coefficient, tool life and power consumption have been measured as per the design of response surface methodology technique. This technique has been used to determine the optimum conditions for the desired responses (minimum tool wear, minimum surface roughness, minimum chip reduction coefficient, minimum power consumption and maximum tool life). Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with Grey relational analysis (GRA) and weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) have been used for optimizing the multi-performance characteristics. WPCA has been proved to provide better results as compared to PCA coupled with GRA with the help of confirmatory test. Fuzzy TOPSIS approach has been used for optimizing performance characteristics namely, tool life and power consumption. It has been proved that Fuzzy TOPSIS is an alternative approach for practical based problems using the decisions that have been taken by decision maker based on experience and skill. FEM modelling has been carried out to determine temperature at the chip/tool interface and validated by experimental results. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractServo {{scanning}} 3 D micro electro {{discharge machining}} (3 D SSMEDM) method can automatically compensate the axial wear of micro rod-electrode in real time by preferably keeping a discharge gap. However, the depth errors of 3 D SSMEDM were even to 10 % due to the accumulation of layers’ thickness errors.
