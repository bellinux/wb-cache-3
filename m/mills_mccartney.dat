Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets.

Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice.

Another composition inspired by Mills was used as the bridal march at their wedding.|$|R
50|$|Stankovic is in {{protracted}} {{dispute with}} the Slovenian government {{on behalf of his}} late mother, Mrs Dana Constance Stankovic (née Dushmanitch). Her father, Vladimir Dushmanitch, married Constance Rowan of Ayr, Scotland in 1920. They had met on the Salonika front in 1918 where he was serving as an artillery captain and ADC to Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and she was an ambulance driver with the Scottish Women's Hospitals Ostrovo Unit. After the marriage the family moved to Belgrade where he practised law. They had four children of which Dana was the third born on Armistice Day 1922. In 1937 Vladimir Dushmanitch bought a plot of land at Bohinj in Slovenia where he built a summer and winter chalet. The property was seized by the Nazis in 1941 and thereafter appropriated by the Communist Party of Slovenia and used as the President's private retreat, and still is. In 2007 the Slovenian government attempted to sell the property to Heather <b>Mills,</b> Sir Paul <b>McCartney's</b> former wife, for €430,000. Milos Stankovic's lawyers, Barker-Gillette, immediately informed Ms Mills' lawyers that living descendants of the rightful owners still had a claim on their property and that she was about to acquire Nazi-looted property. She backed out of the purchase. Milos Stankovic pursued the claim on the family property directly with the President of Slovenia on the basis that Slovenia's accession to the EU was contingent upon the return of property to its rightful owners. In correspondence with the Slovenian government, Stankovic was told that the Slovenian government deemed that the descendants had 'missed the boat' by not applying for return of the property in 1991 during the break up of Yugoslavia and had decided, illegally according to Stankovic, to retain control of the property. Stankovic continues to fight against the Slovenian government's retention of his family's property.|$|R
