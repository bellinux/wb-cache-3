Experiments by the Dutch in the 19th century proved the inefficacy of linseed oil, <b>metallic</b> <b>paint,</b> <b>powdered</b> glass, carbonization (i.e., burning the outer layers of the wood), and any of the usual biocides such as chromated copper arsenate. They also attempted covering wooden pylons with precisely arranged iron nails, but this too had no lasting effect. In 1878 {{it was discovered that}} creosote was an effective deterrent, though to work best it had to be applied to soft, resinous woods like pine; in order to work on harder woods such as oak, special care had to be taken to ensure the wood was completely permeated by the creosote. Submerged wrecks have been protected by wrapping them in geotextiles to provide a physical barrier to the larvae or by reburying them in the sediment. No permanent solution has been found..|$|R

40|$|In this research, Milling {{combined}} Laser Sintering System (MLSS) {{is used to}} make a sintered material. MLSS is a rapid tooling system using a fine <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> {{integrated with}} machining process whereby it can do laser sintering of fine <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> and also high-speed milling. This paper deals with the investigation of sintered material machinability by measuring its specific cutting energy and tool flank temperature. Carbon steel (JIS S 55 C) is selected as a standard steel. The effects of cutting conditions, laser consolidation energy density, powder consolidation mechanisms and unsintered powder on its machinability are measured. It is demonstrated that tool flank temperatures for all sintered materials are higher than JIS S 55 C. Low energy density for consolidation of metal powder increases the machinability of sintered materials. Cutting at the partially molten powder decreases the machinability of sintered material. Cutting with the existence of unsintered <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> surrounding the sintered material diminishes its machinability...|$|R

In our study, three <b>metallic</b> <b>powders</b> with different compositions, particle shapes and particle sizes have been selected as the test materials to produce micro-structured parts using injection moulding process. The combination of three binders (polypropylene, paraffin waxes and stearic acid) with a constant and adapted formulation has been chosen as a binder system. The mixtures obtained by mixing the <b>metallic</b> <b>powders</b> and the binder system with solid loadings ranging from 56 to 64 vol. % have been used as the feedstocks for the next injection moulding. The viscosity of mixture increased with increasing solid loading. These feedstocks were injected using the same injection moulding conditions in the metallic mould structured with pyramidal shape manufactured using electro-erosion machining. The debinding and sintering process have been carried out at different temperatures to eliminate the binders in the injected replica and obtain the final metallic die mould. To analyse the physical properties evolution of the die mould manufactured by PIM and the influence factors (powder nuance, solid loading and sintering conditions), the shrinkage rate, density, roughness of surface, Vickers hardness and mass losses in metallic mould cavities were investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that properly microstructured parts can be obtained using the process chain of injection, debinding and sintering with <b>metallic</b> <b>powders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials. Generally, color keyed primer is close in color to the topcoat and {{is applied to the}} exterior surfaces of the vehicle body. Color specific primer identically matches the topcoat material color, and {{can be used as a}} replacement for topcoat on interior surfaces. Application of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister <b>Powder</b> <b>Paint</b> Delivery System to meet the challenges of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application. In anticipation of multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)
