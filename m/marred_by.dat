40|$|Introduction: The {{myocardium}} at risk (MaR) {{represents the}} quantitative ischemic area destined to myocardial infarction (MI) if no reperfusion therapy is initiated. Different ECG scores for MaR have been developed, {{but there is}} no consensus as to which should be preferred. Objective: Comparisons of ECG scores and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) for determining MaR. Methods: <b>MaR</b> was determined <b>by</b> 3 different ECG scores, and by CMR in ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) patients from the MITOCARE cardioprotection trial. The Aldrich score (AL) is {{based on the number of}} leads with ST-elevation for anterior MI and the sum of ST-segment elevation for inferior MI on the admission ECG. The van Hellemond score (VH) considers both the ischemic and infarcted component of the <b>MaR</b> <b>by</b> adding the AL and the QRS score, which is an estimate of final infarct size. The Hasche score is based on the maximal possible infarct size determined from the QRS score on the baseline ECG. Results: Ninety-eight patients (85 % male, mean age 61. years) met STEMI criteria on their admission ECG and underwent CMR within 3 - 5. days after STEMI. Mean <b>MaR</b> <b>by</b> CMR was 41. 2. ±. 10. 2 and 30. 3. ±. 7. 2 for anterior and inferior infarcts, respectively. For both anterior and inferior infarcts the Aldrich (18. 2. ±. 5. 1 and 18. 6. ±. 6. 0) and Hasche (25. 3. ±. 9. 8 and 26. 4. ±. 8. 8) scores significantly underestimated MaR compared to <b>MaR</b> measured <b>by</b> CMR. In contrast, <b>MaR</b> <b>by</b> the van Hellemond score (37. 0. ±. 14. 2 and 31. 7. ±. 12. 8) was comparable to CMR. Conclusion: We tested the performance of the electrocardiographic estimation of myocardium area at risk by Aldrich, Hasche and van Hellemond ECG scores in comparison to <b>MaR</b> measured <b>by</b> CMR in STEMI patients. <b>MaR</b> <b>by</b> the van Hellemond score and CMR were comparable, while Aldrich and Hasche underestimated MaR...|$|R
