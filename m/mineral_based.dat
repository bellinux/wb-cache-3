500|$|Wheeler {{became famous}} in Britain as [...] "the {{embodiment}} of popular archaeology {{through the medium}} of television". In 1952, Wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new BBC television series, Animal, Vegetable, <b>Mineral?.</b> <b>Based</b> on the American quiz programme What in the World?, the show was hosted by Glyn Daniel and featured three experts in archaeology, anthropology, and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums. However, Wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display. The show proved popular with British audiences, and would air for six more years. It brought Wheeler to public attention, resulting in a Television Personality of the Year award for him in 1954. He also appeared in an episode of Buried Treasure, an archaeology show also hosted by Daniel, in which the pair travelled to Denmark to discuss Tollund Man. In 1957, he appeared in a second episode of Buried Treasure, for which he travelled to Pakistan to discuss that nation's archaeology, and in 1958 again appeared in an episode, this time on the site of Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rhodesia. In 1959 he presented his own three-part series on The Grandeur That Was Rome, for which he travelled to Hadrian's Wall, Pompeii, and Leptis Magna; the show failed to secure high ratings, and was Wheeler's last major foray into television. Meanwhile, he also made appearances on BBC radio, initially featuring on the John Irving series The Archaeologist, but later presenting his own eight-part series on Roman Britain and also appearing on the series Asian Club, which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{industries}} are <b>mineral</b> <b>based,</b> agriculture based, and textile based. Rajasthan {{is the second}} largest producer of polyester fibre in India. Several prominent chemical and engineering companies {{are located in the}} city of Kota, in southern Rajasthan. Rajasthan is pre-eminent in quarrying and mining in India. The Taj Mahal was built from the white marble which was mined from a town called Makrana. The state is the second largest source of cement in India. It has rich salt deposits at Sambhar, copper mines at Khetri, Jhunjhunu, and zinc mines at Dariba, Zawar mines and Rampura Agucha (opencast) near Bhilwara. Dimensional stone mining is also undertaken in Rajasthan. Jodhpur sandstone is mostly used in monuments, important buildings and residential buildings. This stone is termed as [...] "chittar patthar". Jodhpur leads in Handicraft and Guar Gum industry.|$|E
50|$|Cellularization {{occurs in}} several stages. It {{begins with the}} {{formation}} of primitive lipids (e.g. fatty acids or isoprenoid acids) in the surface metabolism. These lipids accumulate on or in the <b>mineral</b> <b>base.</b> This lipophilizes the outer or inner surfaces of the <b>mineral</b> <b>base,</b> which promotes condensation reactions over hydrolytic reactions by lowering the activity of water and protons.|$|R

50|$|Synthetic valve oils {{have become}} more readily available. Characteristics of {{synthetic}} valve oil include, but are not necessarily limited to, greater compatibility with other related oils without chemical reactions (some types of <b>mineral</b> <b>based</b> oils or their additives were known to react with each other, forming thick solids - this required disassembly and complete cleaning of the valves to restore operation), slow evaporation or total lack of evaporation resulting in fewer oilings required, and less dissipation on contact with moisture inside the valve. Some synthetics have the additional advantage {{that they do not}} act as thinners for <b>mineral</b> <b>based</b> slide greases (previously, <b>mineral</b> <b>based</b> valve oil inserted into a valve by way of a tuning slide could carry some slide grease with it, fouling the valve). Finally, high-viscosity synthetic oils can increase valve compression and improve feel in instruments with worn valves, returning such instruments to playable condition.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{hydrocarbon}} base:These synthetic fluids {{are compatible}} with mineral-base hydraulic fluids and were developed to address the low flash point draw back of <b>mineral</b> <b>based</b> hydraulic fluids.|$|E

50|$|In {{the next}} stage lipid {{membranes}} are formed. While still anchored to the <b>mineral</b> <b>base</b> they form a semi-cell bounded partly by the <b>mineral</b> <b>base</b> and partly by the membrane. Further lipid evolution leads to self-supporting lipid membranes and closed cells. The earliest closed cells are pre-cells (sensu Kandler) because they allow frequent exchange of genetic material (e.g. by fusions). According to Woese, this frequent exchange of genetic material is the cause {{for the existence of}} the common stem in the tree of life and for a very rapid early evolution.|$|R

Deposits containing dolomite and siderite also readily yield amphibolites (tremolite-schists, grunerite-schists, and others) especially {{where there has been}} a certain amount of contact metamorphism by adjacent granitic masses. Metamorphosed basalts create ortho-amphibolites and other chemically appropriate lithologies create para-amphibolites.|$|R
