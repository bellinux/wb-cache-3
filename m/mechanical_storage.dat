Using this feature, we are designing and building a system that combines a water-to-water CO 2 heat pump with both hot and cold thermal storages know as Thermal Battery (TB) (Blarke, 2012). Smart and effective use of intermittent renewable energy resources (for example solar and wind power) is obtained supplying water heating (3 ̆e 70 oC) and cooling services (3 ̆c 10 oC) for residential and commercial buildings. Our fundamental hypothesis is that if electricity generated by intermittent sources is destined for thermal end-uses an efficient conversion of electricity to thermal energy and storage enables a flexible power supply.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{measure the}} complex {{rheological}} behavior of nearly critical gels {{and analyze the}} data by searching for characteristic patterns and abstracting those patterns into a self-consistent model. The sample is a linear, flexible, nearly monodisperse polybutadiene which gets cross-linked on its vinyl side groups. The dynamic <b>mechanical</b> <b>storage</b> and loss moduli of cross-linking polymers change smoothly during the liquid-solid transition, while equilibrium rheological properties (e. g., zero-shear viscosity and equilibrium compliance) diverge. During gelation, the relaxation occurs in a distinct pattern which {{can be described in}} a quantitative way with a minimum number of parameters. The pattern can be understood as a combination of the BSW spectrum (representing the precursor relaxation behavior) and the self-similar Chambon-Winter gel spectrum (modeling the terminal relaxation due to growing clusters). The spectrum is cut off at the material’s longest relaxation time, ìmax. Our model parameters, ìmax and Ge (equilibrium modulus), exhibit characteristic scaling behavior with respect to the distance from the gel point, jp- pcj. The relaxation exponent, n, in the terminal zone {{is a function of the}} extent of reaction. Hence, dynamic scaling (requires constant n values) is not valid for our system. The proposed model passes the self-consistency test by predicting the mechanical behavior (at different frequencies) as a function of the extent of reaction and other rheological observations during the sol-gel transition...|$|E
40|$|High-precision micro laser {{drilling}} with high aspect ratios requires laser imaging effects such as optical double rotation. Optical double rotation is an effect where the laser beam is guided through any optical elements {{with a total}} amount of reflections that remains uneven. Those optical elements need to be mounted in a rotary stage that spins the elements with a certain velocity. In an ideal case the optical axis is identically with the rotational axis. Few optical elements such as the Dove-prism show {{the effect that the}} beam is rotated in itself while it is moving on a helical path. That offers an independency of the beam profile. However the Dove-prism alone can not be adjusted {{in a way that the}} two axis match. This is based on geometrical errors of the Dove-prism due to manufacturing technologies. Certain deviation in length and angle lead to a helical error. Additional optical elements can compensate this effect. Alignment that only takes place in one 2 D plane (e. g. the focal plane) leads most likely to a cross-over of both axes (x-alignment) in that one plane. In order to match both axes the alignment needs to be done at least in two 2 D planes. That requires the opportunity to both influence the optical angle and the optical position (parallel shift) in both planes. The highly complex optical alignment method as well as the <b>mechanical</b> <b>storage</b> of the optical elements will be shown in this paper...|$|E

In order to guarantee the sustainable development using the different sources in a smart way first of all {{it is necessary to}} have a large variety in the energy mix. Renewable energy sources play a fundamental role in this challenge and they find the optimal exploitation in the distributed power generation organized through smart grids. One of the bigger problems of the renewables it is the non-concurrence in time between energy production and energy loads. The solution of this problem is another great challenge: the development and the design of efficient energy storage. Depending on the area of interest and on the particular power plant it will be critical to make a convenient and suitable choice of the storage type: thermal, electrical, chemical, mechanical. The technology that I am developing with my research group is a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) which exploits the gyroscopic effects of a flywheel in order to convert the mechanical energy of the sea waves into electrical energy. This device already presents a <b>mechanical</b> <b>storage</b> consisting in the flywheel but the real challenge to deal with is on the electrical part of the energy conversion. Being the energy source (sea waves) strongly irregular and {{characterized by}} high power peaks, {{in order to have a}} feasible grid connection it is necessary to have a smoother electrical power profile.

To study the different opportunities and to gain a whole comprehension of the advantages and of the disadvantages for each one is essential in order to make the right choice for the technology that I'm dealing with. On the other hand it will be very useful to understand which kind of storage is the most suitable for each kind of renewable energy system. Furthermore to have the chance to apply the storage concept to a real innovative application it would be very interesting to highlight all the properties required by a good energy storage for smart grids developmen...|$|E
40|$|MEMS-based {{storage is}} an {{interesting}} new technology that promises to bring fast, non-volatile, mass data storage to computer systems. MEMS-based storage devices (MEMStores) themselves consist of several thousand read/write tips, analogous to the read/write heads of a disk drive, which read and write data in a recording medium. This medium is coated on a moving rectangular surface that is positioned {{by a set of}} MEMS actuators. Access times are expected to be less than a millisecond with energy consumption 10 - 100 X less than a low-power disk drive, while streaming bandwidth and volumetric density are expected to be around that of disk drives. This dissertation explores the use of MEMStores in computer systems, with a focus on whether systems can use existing abstractions and interfaces to incorporate MEMStores effectively, or if they will have to change the way they access storage to benefit from MEMStores. If systems can use MEMStores {{in the same way that}} they use disk drives, it will be more likely that MEMStores will be adopted when they do become available. Since real MEMStores do not yet exist, I present a detailed software model that allows their use to be explored under a variety of workloads. To answer the question of whether a new type of device requires changes to systems, I present a methodology that includes two objective tests for determining whether the benefit from a device is due to a specific difference in how that device accesses data or is just due to the fact that that device is faster, smaller, or uses less energy than current devices. I present a range of potential uses of MEMStores in computer systems, examining each under a number of user workloads, using the two objective tests to evaluate their efficacy. Using the evidence presented and the two objective tests, I show that systems can incorporate MEMStores easily and employ the same standard abstractions and interfaces used with disk systems. At a high level, the intuition is that MEMStores are <b>mechanical</b> <b>storage</b> devices, just like disk drives, only faster, smaller, and requiring less energy to operate. Accessing data requires an initial seek time that is distance-dependent, and, once access has begun, sequential access is the most efficient. This intuition is described in more detail, and the result is shown to hold for the range of uses presented...|$|E

To understand the behavior of {{wind turbines}} during grid disturbances, manufacturers and utility grid operators need to perform a series of tests and accurate transient simulation studies. The latest edition of the IEC 61400 - 21 standard describes methods for such tests that include low voltage ride-through (LVRT), active power set-point control, ramp rate limitations, and reactive power capability tests. The IEC methods are being widely adopted on both national and international levels by wind turbine manufacturers, certification authorities, and utilities. Utility operators also need to estimate how much power wind turbines might be able provide to help regulate grid frequency during situations when they need additional energy quickly, and after design modifications or changes are made to control software, manufacturers may be required to retest their turbines. But testing wind turbines in the field can be a lengthy and expensive process often requiring manufacturers and utility operators to send equipment and personnel to remote locations for long periods of time. NREL's National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) has developed a new Controllable Grid Interface (CGI) test system that can significantly reduce the time and cost required to conduct these tests. The CGI is first test facility in the United States that has fault simulation capabilities and allows manufacturers and system operators to conduct the tests required for certification in a controlled laboratory environment. It is the only system in the world that is fully integrated with two dynamometers and has the capacity to extend that integration to turbines in the field and to a matrix of electronic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>storage</b> devices, all of which are located within close proximity on the same site. NREL's 7. 5 MVA CGI tests wind turbines off-line from the grid, verifies compliance with standards, and provides grid operators with the performance information they need for a fraction of the time and cost it would take to test the turbine in the field. The system combines hardware and real-time control software and is designed to operate with the NWTC's 2. 5 -MW dynamometer as well as the center's new 5 -MW dynamometer test facilities. It is designed to work with four types of wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, and energy storage inverters. Results from the dynamometer tests {{can also be used to}} fine tune and validate the dynamic models used in integration studies and help industry improve turbine performance and develop test standards for renewable technologies and energy storage...|$|E
