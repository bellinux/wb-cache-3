5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, <b>Monel,</b> Nimonic).|$|E
25|$|Common {{materials}} include carbon steel, stainless steel, chrome steel, brass, aluminium, tungsten carbide, platinum, gold, titanium, plastic. Other {{less common}} materials include copper, <b>monel,</b> k-monel, lead, silver, glass, and niobium.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian Building {{featured}} {{innovations in}} both design and technology. The building's designer, Wirt Rowland, specified <b>Monel</b> metal {{in place of}} the commonly used brass and bronze for all exposed metalwork on the building, an innovation which was widely adopted, most notably on New York's Chrysler Building. Rowland dispensed with traditional forms of decoration, using instead colored materials (brick, stone, and terra cotta) set in geometric patterns on both the interior and exterior of the structure. The building's elevator system represented the first use of technology which automatically stopped the car level with the floor and opened the doors, tasks formerly handled by the operator.|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{trying to find the}} {{covalent}} radius of fluorine was in 1938, by Brockway. Brockway prepared a vapour of F2 molecules by means of the electrolysis of potassium bifluoride (KHF2) in a fluorine generator, which was constructed of <b>Monel</b> metal. Then, the product was passed over potassium fluoride so as to remove any hydrogen fluoride (HF) and to condense the product into a liquid. A sample was collected by evaporating the condensed liquid into a Pyrex flask. Finally, using electron diffraction, it was determined that the bond length between the two fluorine atoms was about 145pm. He therefore assumed that the covalent radius of fluorine was half this value, or 73pm. This value, however, is inaccurate due to the large electronegativity and small radius of fluorine atom.|$|E
500|$|The main process {{building}} surpassed The Pentagon as {{the largest}} building in the world, with a floor area of , and an enclosed volume of [...] [...] Construction required [...] of concrete, and [...] of gas pipes. Because uranium hexafluoride corrodes steel, and steel piping had to be coated in nickel, smaller pipes were made of copper or <b>monel.</b> The equipment operated under vacuum pressures, so plumbing had to be air tight. Special {{efforts were made to}} create as clean an environment as possible to areas where piping or fixtures were being installed. J. A. Jones established a special cleanliness unit on 18 April 1944. Buildings were completely sealed off, air was filtered, and all cleaning was with vacuum cleaners and mopping. Workers wore white lintless gloves. At the peak of construction activity in May 1945, 25,266 people were employed on the site.|$|E
500|$|Moissan's {{method is}} used to produce {{industrial}} quantities of fluorine, via the electrolysis of a potassium fluoride/hydrogen fluoride mixture: hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container cathode and a carbon block anode, under 8–12volts, to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively. Temperatures are elevated, KF•2HF melting at [...] and being electrolyzed at [...] KF, which acts as catalyst, is essential since pure HF cannot be electrolyzed. Fluorine {{can be stored in}} steel cylinders that have passivated interiors, at temperatures below otherwise nickel can be used. Regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel, the latter possibly using <b>Monel</b> instead. Frequent passivation, along with the strict exclusion of water and greases, must be undertaken. In the laboratory, glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions; some sources instead recommend nickel-Monel-PTFE systems.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} process technology, there {{continue to be}} recurring corrosion problems that affect the safety and reliability of HFAU. Any section of the unit in contact with HF needs to be built with suitable materials in mind. [...] Carbon steel {{is by far the}} most common material used, although it requires tight controls on composition and hardness. [...] Alternative, more corrosion resistant materials such as such as <b>Monel</b> are sometimes used, but these materials are significantly more expensive and carry their own unique risks, such as stress corrosion cracking. [...] Proper inspection is critical on HFAUs and typically occurs on a much more frequent basis than most other units in a refinery.|$|E
2500|$|The building's three story, vaulted {{lobby is}} lavishly {{decorated}} with Pewabic and Rookwood tile. The semi-circular exterior domes {{are filled with}} Pewabic Pottery; Mary Chase Perry Stratton {{worked closely with the}} architect {{in the design of the}} symbolic decorations. (See Savage, infra.) [...] A <b>Monel</b> metal screen divides the lobby from the banking hall on the second floor, the screen features a clock in the center designed by Tiffany. The building includes works by muralist Ezra Winter in the mosaic above the main lobby desk and the mural at the end of the banking hall. The large mosaic is of a pine tree and text that states the Union Trust Company's purpose for the building, [...] "Founded on principles of faith and understating, this building is erected for the purpose of continuing and maintaining the ideals of financial services which promoted the organization of the institution". The mural highlight’s Michigan’s industries such as manufacturing, farming and mining. In order to dampen the sound in the banking hall, its cement-plaster ceiling features a hand-painted canvas ceiling, which was stretched over a mat of horsehair.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the [...] deep, [...] pool. The pool walls were [...] thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of <b>monel</b> (a rustproof nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within [...] {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine [...] steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below. These steel girders were nearly [...] below ground to accommodate the pool's construction. On top of the girders were double-tongued, prestressed, precast concrete T-beams. The tongue of each T-beam was [...] thick, and the height of the T-beam [...] A [...] thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a [...] layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each [...] and over [...] long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A [...] thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and [...] thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a [...] thick layer of gravel. [...] The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool. The granite for the lip of the pool was imported from West Germany. The granite, which was shaped to wrap around the exterior, top, and interior of the lip, was about [...] thick. [...] The lip of the pool was made of concrete. It was [...] wide, and dropped in a pitch of [...] was it extended toward the water. Overflow drains were placed at intervals on the inside of the lip, just below the granite cladding. A gutter just outside the pool provided extra diversion in case water spilled over the lip. Grey granite slabs, also imported from West Germany, formed a sidewalk around the pool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> metal is an alloy of {{approximately}} two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It {{is similar to}} platinum in color. <b>Monel</b> pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of <b>Monel</b> was for roofing the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the New York City Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a <b>Monel</b> metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. <b>Monel</b> was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of <b>Monel</b> was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced <b>Monel</b> because of lower production costs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monel</b> 404 alloy is used {{primarily}} in specialized electrical and electronic applications. The composition of <b>Monel</b> 404 is carefully adjusted {{to provide a}} very low Curie temperature, low permeability, and good brazing characteristics.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, when steam power was widely used, <b>Monel</b> was advertised as being {{desirable}} {{for use in}} superheated steam systems. During the world wars, <b>Monel</b> was used for US military dog tags.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> {{is used as}} the {{material}} for valve pistons or rotors in some higher quality musical instruments such as trumpets, tubas and French horns. RotoSound introduced the use of <b>Monel</b> for electric bass strings in 1962, and these strings {{have been used by}} numerous artists, including Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, The Who, Sting, John Deacon, and John Paul Jones and the late Chris Squire. <b>Monel</b> was in use in the early 1930s by other musical string manufacturers, such as Gibson Guitar Corporation, who continue to offer them for mandolin as the Sam Bush signature set. Also, C.F. Martin & Co. uses <b>Monel</b> for their Martin Retro acoustic guitar strings. The Pyramid string factory (Germany) produces 'Monel classics' electric guitar strings, wound on a round core. In 2017, D'Addario string company released a line of violin strings using a <b>Monel</b> winding on the D and G string.|$|E
50|$|Good {{resistance}} against corrosion by acids and oxygen makes <b>Monel</b> a good {{material for the}} chemical industry. Even corrosive fluorides can be handled within <b>Monel</b> apparatus; this was done in an extensive way in the enrichment of uranium in the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Here most of the larger diameter tubing for the uranium hexafluoride was made from <b>Monel.</b> Regulators for reactive cylinder gases like hydrogen chloride form another example, where PTFE is not a suitable option when high delivery pressures are required. These will sometimes include a <b>Monel</b> manifold and taps prior to the regulator that allow the regulator to be flushed with a dry, inert gas after use to further protect the equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> {{has also}} been used in Kelvinator refrigerators.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> {{was created}} by Robert Crooks Stanley, {{who worked for the}} International Nickel Company (INCO) in 1901. <b>Monel</b> alloy 400 is a binary alloy of the same {{proportions}} of nickel and copper as is found naturally in the nickel ore from the Sudbury (Ontario) mines and is therefore considered a puritan alloy. <b>Monel</b> was named after company president Ambrose Monell, and patented in 1906. One L was dropped, because family names were not allowed as trademarks at that time. The name is now atrademark of Special Metals Corporation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monel</b> K-500 {{combines}} the excellent corrosion resistance characteristic of <b>Monel</b> alloy 400 {{with the added}} advantages of greater strength and hardness. The increased properties are obtained by adding aluminum and titanium to the nickel-copper base, and by heating under controlled conditions so that submicroscopic particles of Ni3 (Ti, Al) are precipitated throughout the matrix.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> is a {{group of}} nickel alloys, {{primarily}} composed of nickel (up to 67%) and copper, with small amounts of iron, manganese, carbon, and silicon. Stronger than pure nickel, <b>Monel</b> alloys are resistant to corrosion by many agents, including rapidly flowing seawater.

50|$|<b>Monel</b> is a solid-solution binary alloy. As {{nickel and}} copper are {{mutually}} soluble in all proportions, it is a single-phase alloy.Compared to steel, <b>Monel</b> {{is very difficult}} to machine as it work-hardens very quickly. It needs to be turned and worked at slow speeds and low feed rates. It is resistant to corrosion and acids, and some alloys can withstand a fire in pure oxygen. It is commonly used in applications with highly corrosive conditions. Small additions of aluminium and titanium form an alloy (K-500) with the same corrosion resistance but with much greater strength due to gamma prime formation on aging. <b>Monel</b> is typically much more expensive than stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> R-405 is {{the free}} {{machining}} version of <b>Monel</b> 400. It is a nickel-copper alloy with a controlled amount of sulfur added to provide sulfide inclusions {{that act as}} chip breakers during machining. Like <b>Monel</b> 400, alloy R-405 is resistant to sea water and steam at high temperatures {{as well as to}} salt and caustic solutions. <b>Monel</b> R-405 is a solid solution alloy that can only be hardened by cold working. This nickel alloy exhibits characteristics like good corrosion-resistance, good weldability and high strength. A low corrosion rate in rapidly flowing brackish or seawater combined with excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking in most freshwaters combined to its resistance to a variety of corrosive conditions justifies its wide use in marine applications and other non-oxidizing chloride solutions. This nickel steel alloy is particularly resistant to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids when they are de-aerated. As would be expected from its high copper content, alloy R-405 is rapidly attacked by nitric acid and ammonia systems.|$|E
