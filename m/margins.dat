5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin.

Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern <b>margins</b> of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau.

40|$|As a {{reaction}} to the general suspicion that <b>margin</b> loans had been a key element of the stock market boom and crash of the late 1920 s, the Federal Reserve Bank was empowered to regulate <b>margin</b> lending with the Securities and Exchange Act. The efficacy of the Federal Reserve's <b>margin</b> policy has extensively been studied empirically. However, there still exists no formal rationale for the regulation of <b>margin</b> lending. In this paper, we demonstrate in a principal-agent model that the availability of <b>margin</b> loans can cause the development of a stock market bubble through inducing investors to pay more for a stock than its fundamental value. We show that the emergence of a <b>margin</b> loan induced bubble can be ruled out by an initial <b>margin</b> requirement and thus provide a formal rationale for <b>margin</b> regulation. asset pricing, asset price bubbles, <b>margin</b> loans, <b>margin</b> regulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Support vector {{machines}} (SVMs) and Boosting are {{possibly the}} two most popular learning approaches {{during the past two}} decades. It is well known that the <b>margin</b> is a fundamental issue of SVMs, whereas recently the <b>margin</b> theory for Boosting has been defended, establish-ing a connection between these two mainstream approaches. The recent theoretical results disclosed that the <b>margin</b> distribution rather than a single <b>margin</b> is really crucial for the generalization performance, and suggested to optimize the <b>margin</b> distribution by maximizing the mar-gin mean and minimizing the <b>margin</b> variance simultaneously. Inspired by this recognition, we advocate the large <b>margin</b> distribution learning, a promising research direction that has exhibited superiority in algorithm designs to traditional large <b>margin</b> learning. ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{boosting}} algorithms rely on {{the notion}} of a <b>margin</b> to give weights to examples. If a convex loss is utilized (as in AdaBoost, LogitBoost, and all members of the AnyBoost family of algorithms) then an example with higher <b>margin</b> will receive less (or equal) weight than an example with lower <b>margin.</b> This leads the boosting algorithm to focus weight on low <b>margin</b> examples. In nonconvex algorithms (e.g. BrownBoost), the <b>margin</b> still dictates the weighting of an example, though the weighting is non-monotone with respect to <b>margin.</b> There exists boosting algorithms that provably maximize the minimum <b>margin</b> (e.g. see [...] ).|$|R

Optimal <b>margin</b> system is chosen from those systems which satisfy the constraint of the risk measure. The resulted <b>margin</b> system is able to adjust actively {{with respect to the}} changes of stock prices. The <b>margin</b> system required by the Shanghai Stock Exchange is compared with the proposed system, where 25, 200 <b>margin</b> loans of 126 stocks listed on the SSE are investigated.
