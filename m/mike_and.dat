5|$|Plans for {{a second}} Monsters, Inc. film existed since 2005. Following {{disagreements}} between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney—which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films up to Cars—announced that a sequel to Monsters, Inc. would be made by Circle 7 Animation, which was also working on early drafts of Toy Story 3 & Finding Nemo 2. Titled Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise, the film would have focused on <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present, {{only to find that}} she had moved. After getting trapped in the human world, <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do.
