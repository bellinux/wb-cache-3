40|$|Induction {{machines}} convert {{more than}} 55 % of electrical energy into various other forms in industrial and domestic environments. Improved performance, especially {{by reduction of}} losses in induction machines hence can significantly reduce consumption of electricity. Many design and control methods are adopted to make induction machines work more efficiently, however certain design compromises are inevitable, such as skewing the rotor to improve the magnetic noise and torque characteristics increase the cross current losses considerably in a cage rotor, degrading {{the efficiency of the}} motor. Crosscurrent losses are the dominating stray losses which are dependent on several factors among them are percentage skew and the contact resistance between the rotor bars and laminations. It is shown in this thesis that implementing a design change which has non-skewed asymmetrical distribution of rotor slots can serve the same purpose as skewing i. e., reduction of the magnetic noise, thereby avoiding the negative effects of skewing the rotor slots especially by reducing the cross-current losses. Two design ethodologies to introduce asymmetry in rotor slots are proposed and the key performance characteristics like torque ripple, <b>radial</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> forces are computed both numerically and analytically. Radial forces obtained from the finite element method are coupled to the analytical tool forcalculating the magnetic noise. A spectral method to calculate and separate the radial forces into vibration modes and their respective frequencies is proposed and validated for a standard 4 -pole induction motor. The influence of rotor slot number, eccentricity and skew on radial forces and magnetic noise are studied using finite element method {{in order to understand the}} vibrational and acoustic behavior of the machine, especially for identifying their sources. The validated methods on standard motors are applied for investigating the asymmetrical rotor slot machines. <b>Radial</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> forces and magnetic noise spectra are computed for the novel dual and sinusoidal symmetrical rotors and compared with the standard symmetrical rotor. The results obtained showed reduced radial forces and magnetic noise in asymmetrical rotors, both for the eccentric and noneccentric cases. Based on the results obtained some guide lines for designing  asymmetrical rotor slots are established. Magnitudes of the harmful modes of vibration observed in the eccentric rotors, which usually occur in reality, are considerably reduced in asymmetrical rotors showing lower sound intensity levels produced by asymmetrical rotors. The noise level from mode- 2 vibration in a 4 -pole standard 15 kW motor running with 25 % static eccentricity is decreased by about 6 dB, compared to the standard rotors. Hence improved performance can be achieved by removing skew which reduces cross current losses and by employing asymmetrical rotor slots same noise level can be maintained or can be even lowered.    QC 2011022...|$|R
40|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{is currently the}} choice for many wind turbines. These generators, when connected to the grid through a converter, is subjected to varied power system conditions like voltage variation, frequency variation, short circuit fault conditions, etc. Further, many countries like Canada, Germany, UK, Scotland, etc. have distinct grid codes relating to wind turbines. Accordingly, following the network faults, wind turbines have to supply a definite reactive current. To satisfy the requirements including reactive current capability, an optimum electrical design becomes a mandate for DFIG to function. This paper intends to optimize the equivalent circuit parameters of an electrical design for satisfactory DFIG performance. Direct search method {{has been used for}} optimization of the parameters. The variables selected include electromagnetic core dimensions (diameters and stack length), slot dimensions, <b>radial</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between stator and rotor and winding copper cross section area. Optimization for 2 MW DFIG has been executed separately for three objective functions - maximum reactive power capability (Case I), maximum efficiency (Case II) and minimum weight (Case III). In the optimization analysis program, voltage variations (10 %), power factor- leading and lagging (0. 95), speeds for corresponding to slips (- 0. 3 to + 0. 3) have been considered.

The bearing system may be mounted within a flow straightener, diffuser, or other pump element to support the shaft of a pump rotor. The bearing system includes a zirconia shaft having a radiused end. The radiused end has a first radius selected to be about three {{times greater than the}} radius of the zirconia shaft. The radiused end of the zirconia shaft engages a flat sapphire endstone. Due to the relative hardness of these materials a flat is quickly produced during break-in on the zirconia radiused end of precisely the size necessary to support thrust loads whereupon wear substantially ceases. Due to the selection of the first radius, the change in shaft end-play during pump break-in is limited to a total desired end-play of less than about 0. 010 inches. Radial loads are supported by an olive hole ring jewel that makes near line contact around the circumference of the shaft to support high speed rotation with little friction. The width of olive hole ring jewel is small to allow heat to conduct through to thereby prevent heat build-up in the bearing.

Advanced turbomachinery {{is on its}} way to surpassing the capabilities of rolling-element bearings and conventional dampers. To meet these demands, gas turbine engines of the future will demand increased efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio, and reduced specific fuel consumption and noise. The more-electric engine replaces oil-lubricated bearings, dampers, gears, and seals with electrical devices. One such device is the magnetic bearing. The Vehicle Technology Directorate and Glenn have demonstrated the operation of a radial magnetic bearing in combination with a hydrostatic bearing at 1000 F at 31, 000 rpm (2. 3 MDN 1). This unique combination takes advantage of a high-temperature rub surface in the event of electrical power loss or sudden overloads. The hydrostatic bearings allow load sharing with the magnetic bearing. The magnetic-hydrostatic bearing combination eliminates wear and high contact stress from sudden acceleration of the rolling-element bearings and overheating. The magnetic bearing enables high damping, adaptive vibration control, and precise rotor positioning, diagnostics, and health monitoring.

The thickness of the water equivalent material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> ranged from 0. 2 to 4 cm. Dose was calculated with the Eclipse PBC algorithm and AAA.

The measured results indicate that as the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> increases (from 1 to 15 cm) the dose reduces at the water surface and that beyond an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> a secondary buildup region is required to re-establish electronic equilibrium. The dose beyond the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> is also reduced at depths beyond the secondary buildup region. The PBC algorithm did not predict any reduction in dose beyond the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> AAA predicted the secondary buildup region but did not predict the reduction in dose at depths beyond it. The reduction in dose beyond the secondary buildup region was shown to be particularly relevant for <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> of 5 cm or more when there was a 2 cm of water equivalent material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> For these cases, where electronic equilibrium is established in the material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> both algorithms were found to overestimate the dose by 2. 0 %- 5. 5 %. It was concluded that the dose to depths of up to 15 cm beyond a large <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> is reduced due to a decrease in scattered radiation, produced in the material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> reaching the point of interest. This effect is not well modeled by the Eclipse AAA and PBC algorithm and may result in dose calculation errors greater than 2. 5 %. Due to the contribution of other uncertainties in the radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery process, dose calculation errors of this magnitude are not consistent with the recommendation of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements that the absorbed dose to the target volume be delivered with an uncertainty of less than ± 5 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{key point}} of FAM control {{is that the}} {{exciting}} current is kept constant in magnitude and continuous in the equivalent circuit. The speed of rotating <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> flux is made free or adjustable. This means that the magnetic field in the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> is kept constant in its amplitude and that its speed is adjustable so that a desired value of torque is produced. When the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> flux is kept constant, other variables like voltages, current and torque are functions of slip frequency only. By accelerating or decelerating rotation of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> flux to choose the slip frequency, the torque can be controlled as desired.|$|R
