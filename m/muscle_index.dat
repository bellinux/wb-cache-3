40|$|Background: Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{important}} to determine physical activity and exercise capacity in cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the relationship between skeletal muscle volume measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and ventilation indices assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test in patients with myocardial infarction. Methods: A total of 60 patients (57 men; 59  ±  9  years) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled into this study. All patients performed cardiac rehabilitation and then achieved physical activity of daily life. No patient was complicated by diabetes mellitus. In symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test, minute ventilation (V̇E), oxygen consumption (V̇O 2), and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO 2) were continuously obtained. A volume of skeletal muscle measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis was normalized for height (skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index).</b> Results: The skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> showed a significant inverse correlation with peak V̇E/V̇O 2 (p =  0. 02, r = − 0. 39) and peak V̇E/V̇CO 2 (p =  0. 02, r = − 0. 30). In addition, the skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> inversely correlated with V̇E/V̇CO 2 slope (p =  0. 02, r = − 0. 30). On the other hand, the skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> did not significantly correlate with peak V̇O 2 (p =  0. 56, r =  0. 08) and peak V̇CO 2 (p =  0. 99, r =  0. 001). Besides, the skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> did not significantly correlate with ΔV̇O 2 /Δwork rate slope (p =  0. 60, r =  0. 07). Conclusions: The increase in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> {{was associated with the}} amelioration of ventilatory efficacy to exercise at the peak level. Furthermore, the increase in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> may account for favorable prognosis. These findings could strengthen the role of skeletal muscle in exercise capacity of patients with myocardial infarction...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the relationships between CT measured parameters of body composition and the systemic inflammatory response in patients with primary operable colorectal cancer. Patient and Methods: 174 patients with primary operable colorectal cancer who underwent resection with curative intent (2003 – 2010). Image analysis of CT scans was used to measure total fat index (cm 2 /m 2), subcutaneous fat index (cm 2 /m 2), visceral fat index (cm 2 /m 2) and skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> (cm 2 /m 2). Systemic inflammatory response was measured by serum white cell count (WCC), neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS). Results: There were no relationships between any parameter of body composition and serum WCC or NLR. There was a significant relationship between low skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> and an elevated systemic inflammatory response, as measured by the mGPS (p = 0. 001). This was confirmed by linear relationships between skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> and both C-reactive protein (r = 20. 21, p = 0. 005) and albumin (r = 0. 31, p, 0. 001).

It is not clear whether β-cell function is related to muscle mass in subjects without diabetes. We investigated the relationship between β-cell function and skeletal muscle mass in Japanese subjects without diabetes. The study included 1098 subjects (538 men and 560 women) aged 40 to 79 years, without diabetes (fasting glucose lower than 126 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin lower than 6. 5 %), who consulted Osaka Medical College Health Science Clinic for a medical examination. Appendicular muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Appendicular <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> was calculated as appendicular muscle mass divided by height squared (kg/m 2). The homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function was used to assess β-cell function. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance was used as a measure of insulin resistance. The association between appendicular <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> and clinical parameters of β-cell function and insulin resistance was examined. Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance showed a normal distribution.

The aim {{of this study was to}} measure biochemical, serologic, hormonal, radiographic, and anthropometric features in a cohort of hospitalized cirrhotic patients to characterize biomarkers for identification of malnutrition. In this prospective observational cohort study, 52 hospitalized cirrhotic patients were classified as malnourished (42. 3 %) or nourished (57. 7 %) based on mid-arm muscle circumference < 23 cm and dominant handgrip strength < 30 kg. Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Appetite was assessed using the Simplified Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) score. Fasting levels of serum adipokines, cytokines, and hormones were determined using Luminex assays.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} a new, ultrasound-based method for diagnosing sarcopenia and test its validity against a conventional, clinically used method based on bioelectrical impedence analysis (BIA) 1. Method: 24 participants (13 men and 11 women), aged 65 - 83 yrs, were recruited for this study. Skeletal <b>Muscle</b> <b>Index</b> (SMI) was estimated by BIA as described by Janssen et al (2002) 1. The ultrasound-based evaluation of sarcopenia was obtained from a sagittal image of the vastus lateralis muscle acquired in the lower third of the muscle belly using a linear probe (13 - 4 MHz) with an Esaote Mylab 25 ultrasound machine. For each ultrasound image, fascicle length (Lf) and muscle thickness (Tm) were measured using the Java-based image analysis software ImageJ (National Institute of Health). Individuals were classified as sarcopenic if the Lf/Tm ratio was > 4. 38 corresponding to the cut-off value of 1 -SD above the mean of a young adult reference population (Narici et al 2011) 2.

The present study {{aimed to explore}} whether total functional liver volume (TFLV) is related to sarcopenia in patients undergoing partial liver resection. MethodsAnalysis of total liver volume and tumour volume and measurements of muscle surface were performed in patients undergoing liver resection using OsiriX® and preoperative computed tomography. The ratio of TFLV to bodyweight was calculated as: [TFLV (ml) /bodyweight (g) ]* 100 %. The L 3 <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> (cm 2 /m 2) was then calculated by normalizing muscle areas (at the third lumbar vertebral level) for height. ResultsOf 40 patients, 27 (67. 5 %) were classified as sarcopenic. There was a significant correlation between the L 3 skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> and TFLV (r= 0. 64, P < 0. 001). Median TFLV was significantly lower in the sarcopenia group than in the non‐sarcopenia group [1396  ml (range: 1129 – 2625  ml) and 1840  ml (range: 867 – 2404  ml), respectively; P < 0. 05].

40|$|Background:  Cancer-associated inflammation, in {{the form}} of local and {{systemic}} inflammatory responses, appear to be linked to tumour necrosis and have prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer. However, their relationship with circulating biochemical mediators is unclear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the interrelationships between circulating mediators, in particular interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumour necrosis, and local and systemic inflammatory responses in patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer. Methods:  Data were collected from preoperative blood tests for 118 patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer. Analysis of circulating IL- 6, IL- 10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), differential white cell count, C-reactive protein, and albumin were carried out. Routine pathology specimens were examined for tumour characteristics including necrosis and the extent of the inflammatory cell infiltrate. Body composition was examined using body mass index (BMI), total body fat, subcutaneous body fat, visceral fat, and skeletal muscle mass. Results:  Circulating IL- 6 concentrations were significantly associated with increased T stage (P&# 60; 0. 05), tumour necrosis (P&# 60; 0. 001), IL- 10 (P&# 60; 0. 001), VEGF (P&# 60; 0. 001), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS; P&# 60; 0. 001), white cell (P&# 60; 0. 01) and platelet (P&# 60; 0. 01) counts, and low skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> (P&# 60; 0. 01). When normalised for T stage, tumour necrosis was associated with IL- 6 (P&# 60; 0. 001), IL- 10 (P&# 60; 0. 01), VEGF (P&# 60; 0. 001), mGPS (P&# 60; 0. 001), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR; P&# 60; 0. 05), white cell (P&# 60; 0. 001), neutrophil (P&# 60; 0. 05), and platelet counts (P&# 60; 0. 005), and skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> (P&# 60; 0. 001).

We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal clinical relevance of 3 sarcopenia definitions in the Korean population. Patients and methods: We conducted comprehensive geriatric assessments for 1, 379 community-dwelling older participants in the Aging Study of PyeongChang Rural Area (ASPRA) cohort and followed them up prospectively for death, institutionalization, and disability every 3  months. Sarcopenia was defined using the Asian Working Group consensus algorithm, combining grip strength, gait speed, and muscle mass. Results: Among 1, 343 participants (mean age: 76 years, 741 women) analyzed, there were 29  deaths and 89  institutionalizations during 22. 0 ± 8. 3 months follow-up (mean ± SD). All three muscle indices correlated to age and sex. All sarcopenia criteria with muscle mass indices of height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) adjustment significantly predicted death or institutionalization. However, when adjusted for age and sex, only the sarcopenia criteria with muscle mass index of height adjustment were significantly associated with major adverse health outcomes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was {{to examine the effects of}} a repeated eccentric exercise on position sense and muscle reaction angle. Fourteen healthy women underwent an isokinetic exercise session on their knee flexors, which was repeated after 4 weeks. <b>Muscle</b> damage <b>indices,</b> position sense and joint reaction angle of the knee were examined before, immediately after, as well as at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after exercise. The second exercise bout induced significantly lesser effects in all <b>muscle</b> damage <b>indices</b> as well as lesser disturbances in position sense and reaction angle when compared to the first one. The main finding of this study is that position sense and joint reaction angle to release of the lower limbs may adapt in response to a repeated bout of eccentric exercise, leading to less disturbances in position sense and reaction angle after the second bout of exercise. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{utilization}} of pneumatic {{muscles in the}} actuation of robotized systems {{is still in its}} early stages, thus calling for further study of such constructive solutions. The need for light robotized systems with improved dynamics has {{led to the development of}} pneumatic muscles as a power source for the system. This type of actuator, which has also an excellent power/weight ratio, meets the need for safety, simplicity and lightness. Starting from the human model, the paper presents and discusses the performance of a standardizable rotation module, actuated by pneumatic muscles and adaptable on robotic systems designed for the aid of disabled persons. Rotation of a cylindrical joint by means of pneumatic muscles is achieved in a considerably similar way to that generated by human muscles, based on the agonist vs. antagonist principle, namely as one muscle contracts the other will relax.

40|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} and <b>muscle</b> damage <b>indices</b> were compared between four popular team sports at an elite level. Seventy two male elite players of four team sports: soccer (n = 18), basketball (n = 18), volleyball (n = 18) and handball (n = 18), completed an official match, while 18 non-athletes served as controls. Blood samples were drawn before, immediately after and 13 and 37 h post-match. Soccer produced the greatest increase in inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6), which were increased by 3 - 4 fold {{immediately after the}} game, {{as well as in}} C-reactive protein, which was increased by threefold in the next morning after the match. Metabolic stress (urea, ammonia and cortisol) and <b>muscle</b> damage <b>indices</b> (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) were also higher after soccer, with creatine kinase responses being almost 2 - 3 times higher than the other sports. Volleyball showed the smallest increase in inflammation and muscle damage markers compared with the other three sports...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{examined}} {{prevalence of}} sarcopenia in Korean patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} and compared body compositional parameters between subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The Korean Sarcopenic Obesity Study (KSOS) included 810 subjects (414 patients with diabetes and 396 control subjects) who were examined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Prevalence of sarcopenia was defined using the skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index</b> (SMI). RESULTS — Prevalence in patients with diabetes and {{in the control group}} was 15. 7 and 6. 9 %, respectively. In both men and women, SMI values were significantly decreased in patients with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that type 2 diabetes was independently associated with sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS — Type 2 diabetes was associated with increased risk of sarcopenia. These characteristics may contribute to physical disability and metabolic disorders in older adults with diabetes. People in Asia tend to develop type...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia {{evaluated}} by computed tomography (CT) scan at the lumbar site {{has been identified}} as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the measurement of muscle mass through CT scan, considered the gold standard, with other reliable techniques to evaluate the rate of agreement between different available methods for the assessment of muscle mass in cirrhosis. The correlation between measurements of muscle mass and of muscle strength was also investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients eligible for liver transplantation were studied. Lumbar skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by CT and muscle depletion was defined using previously published cut-offs. Mid-arm muscle circumference was calculated following anthropometric measures. The Fat-Free Mass Index and the Appendicular Skeletal <b>Muscle</b> <b>Index</b> were calculated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle strength was evaluated using the Hand Grip test. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with cirrhosis were included. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 76...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective This {{cross-sectional}} population-based study {{aimed to}} determine the cutoff points of anthropometric indicators to screen for sarcopenia and the association between sarcopenia and these indicators. Methods The sample consisted of 601 older adults. Sarcopenia was detected by appendicular skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>index.</b> The receiver operating characteristic curve identified the cutoff points for body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and handgrip strength to screen for sarcopenia. Based on the cut-off points, principal component analysis determined which indicators had a better fit as discriminants to compose an indicator. Finally, logistic regression analysis was performed with this indicator as the main independent variable. Results The results showed that all anthropometric indicators and handgrip strength were capable of discriminating sarcopenia; however, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio were the best discriminants in principal components analysis, composing the new indicator. Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that sarcopenia {{was associated with the}} indicator in both sexes. Conclusion The concomitant presence of low body mass index, low waist circumference, and low waist-to-height ratio may help to discriminate sarcopenia...|$|E
40|$|The aims {{of study}} were {{to analyze the}} {{relationship}} between muscle mass and anthropometric parameters in elderly women {{and to develop a}} mathematical model to predict muscle mass based on anthropometric parameters. The study included 63 elderly women (71. 4 ± 4. 4 years). Body weight, height, arm, waist, hip and calf circumferences were measured. Muscle mass was estimated using a densitometry. The <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> was calculated using the equation (<b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> = <b>muscle</b> mass [kg] / height [m]²). A significant correlation was found between muscle mass and body weight (r = 0. 782), arm (r= 0. 688), waist (r= 0. 467), hip (r= 0. 629) and calf circumferences (r= 0. 592) with p 0. 05). The results of this study indicated that body mass, body mass index, arm, waist, hip and calf circumferences are related to muscle mass elderly women. The muscle mass can be adequately predicted based on data from body mass and calf circumference. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background/Purpose: Measures {{to prevent}} the {{development}} of muscle mass decline should be initiated from midlife. However, the impact of physical activity at midlife on muscle mass in old age remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} whether physical activity at midlife influences muscle mass and physical performance in old age. Methods: A total of 272 Japanese women aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the study. Information about physical activity levels at midlife and in old age were collected using a retrospective questionnaire. We calculated the skeletal <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> in old age and recorded the participants' walking speed and hand grip strength in old age. We then classified the participants into four groups according to their physical activity levels at midlife and in old age and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to determine whether the physical activity levels at midlife and in old age were associated with skeletal <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> and physical performance in old age. Results: The participants in the groups that were physically inactive at midlife had a significantly lower skeletal <b>muscle</b> mass <b>index</b> in old age than those who were physically active at midlife (p <  0. 01). Participants in the groups that were physically inactive in old age also had significantly slower walking speeds at old age than those who were physically active (p <  0. 01). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and body mass index. Conclusion: Physical activity at midlife may be associated with a higher muscle mass in old age and physical activity in old age may be associated with higher walking speeds in old age...|$|R
