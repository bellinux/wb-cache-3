40|$|As {{previously}} reported, {{magnesium sulphate}} administered parenterally significantly increased an opioid antinociception in {{different kinds of}} pain. Since the typical form of magnesium salts are poorly and slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract we examined whether their micronized form could increase opioids induced antinociception. In behavioural studies on rats morphine, tramadol and oxycodone together with <b>magnesium</b> (<b>lactate</b> dihydrate, hydroaspartate, chloride) in micronized (particles of size D 90 < 50 μm) and conventional forms were used. Changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli. The intestinal absorption of two forms of <b>magnesium</b> <b>lactate</b> dihydrate (at the doses of 7. 5 or 15 mg ions) in the porcine gut sac model were also compared. Micronized form of <b>magnesium</b> <b>lactate</b> dihydrate or hydroaspartate but not chloride (15 mg of magnesium ions kg- 1) enhanced the analgesic activity of orally administered opioids, significantly faster and more effective {{in comparison to the}} conventional form of magnesium salts (about 40 % for oxycodone administered together with a micronized form of magnesium hydroaspartate). Moreover, in vitro studies of transport across porcine intestines of magnesium ions showed that magnesium salts administered in micronized form were absorbed from the intestines {{to a greater extent than}} the normal form of magnesium salts. The co-administration of micronized magnesium organic salts with opioids increased their synergetic analgesic effect. This may suggest an innovative approach to the treatment of pain in clinical practice...|$|E

Turtles were considered to be clinically healthy when no external injuries or lesions were observed and {{there was no evidence of}} disease or emaciation. Differences in blood profiles were detected between sites, but not between age groups or sexes. Turtles that were exposed to L. majuscula generally had lower plasma glucose concentrations and decreased LDH activity, which may represent a metabolic downregulation resulting from food limitation.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the triple effect of ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (EMHPS), organic magnesium salt (<b>magnesium</b> <b>lactate),</b> and vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine). Material and methods. A systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the triple synergic action of EMHPS, magnesium, and vitamin B 6 was carried out. For chemoinformational analysis, the investigators developed a new mathematical method based on the combinatorial theory of solvability, which allows one to obtain quantitative estimates of the affinity constants of proteome proteins. Results. The pharmacological effects of the EMHPS molecule characterized by nootropic and antioxidant properties are shown to work in synergy with magnesium and vitamin B 6. A systematic analysis of synergy interactions indicated 46 biological roles, in which the synergy of EMHPS, magnesium, and pyridoxine could be manifested. The main goals of this synergy are to protect neurons from damage, by combating excitotoxicity in the cells and to neutralize excess homocysteine (to {{reduce the risk of}} ischemic and thrombotic stroke, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease); to improve cognitive functions and neuromuscular transmission, to reduce anxiety, by activating acetylcholine, GABA, and dopamine receptors; to normalize lipid and glucose metabolism, by lowering hyperglycemia and improving the processing of fats. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chapter I reports {{studies on}} a number of common drugs and metabolites, some of which were found to affect lipids. Quantitative studies of drug—induced release of {{cholesterol}} esters from lipoproteins in vitro are described. Tetracycline was found to act an both lipoproteins and proteins, causing marked denaturation of the latter and a strong delipidation of the former. Similar effects were noted in the cases of Atromid S and Phenformin. These drugs were also reacted with serum in combination with <b>magnesium</b> <b>lactate</b> alone, and in combination with pyridoxine, and in the latter case some enhancement of delipidating effects were seen. Similar tests {{on a number}} of amino acids were negative. Spectrophotometric, electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic investigations of the type and degree of binding of tetracycline and nitrofurantoin to serum proteins are reported in Chapter II. Competitive binding of tetracycline with displacement of lipids from their binding sites support the findings of Baer, Palmer Schmitt and Chargaff. Evidence is presented on competition between serum protein fractions for the denaturing drug. The main aim of the work described in Chapter III was to ascertain whether chemical features of serum sphingolipids are of diagnostic value. Quantitation of free ceramides showed that, while total serum ceramides (which correlate well with serum triglycerides) seldom vary beyond normal limits, fractions rich in hydroxy-acids indicate atherosclerotic risk. Such diagnostic data appear more reliable than indications from cholesterol assays. The free serum ceramides noted were assigned origins from sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids respectively. A routine method for the assay of free serum ceramides has been developed; it is based on a thin—layer chromatographic technique followed by densitometric scanning. The patterns of fatty acid moiety in diagnostically interesting free serum ceramides have been established by gas—liquid chromatography. The concomitant variation of base moieties appears of less practical interest...|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, a rapid-clotting serum tube, BD Vacutainer Rapid Serum Tube (RSTTM), was {{introduced}} to improve turn-around times for serum samples. Previous studies reported reduced concentrations of some markers of haemolysis in RST specimens compared to other serum or plasma samples. We aimed to compare RST to plasma tubes for haemolysis markers in an emergency department (ED) setting, where increased rates of haemolysis are commonly seen. Methods: Patients presenting to ED over an eight-day period had an RST, BD Vacutainer PSTTM II (plasma) Tube and BD Vacutainer Heparin (non-gel, plasma) Tube collected. Blood was drawn from an intravenous cannula, and samples were promptly analysed for haemolysis index, potassium, phosphate, aspartate aminotrasferase (AST), <b>magnesium</b> and <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase (LD). Results: A total of 347 patient samples were included, and 9. 2 % of the PST samples were haemolysed. The RST tubes had small increases {{in all of the}} haemolysis markers compared to both plasma tubes (P 4 0. 005), except LD which was lower in the RST group. There {{were no significant differences in}} the proportion of results above the upper reference limit between the tubes, except for LD which had a lower proportion in RST samples (P 4 0. 002). Conclusion: Compared to plasma, RST specimens show small increases in several haemolysis markers, consistent with known differences between serum and plasma, but the proportion of elevated haemolysis markers is similar to plasma. In a setting with a high haemolysis rate such as ED, RST specimens provide a non-inferior sample type for markers of haemolysis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Although {{magnesium}} {{plays an}} important role in aerobic metabolism and magnesium deficiency is a common phenomenon in critical illness, the association between magnesium deficiency and lactic acidosis in the intensive care unit (ICU) has not been defined. Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted at a 77 ICU bed tertiary medical center. Data pertaining to the first unique admission of any ICU patient between 2001 and 2008 were extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care database. Hypomagnesemia was defined as serum magnesium 2 and > 4 mmol/L, respectively. Multivariate modeling was used to explore the association between <b>magnesium</b> and <b>lactate</b> concentrations. Results: Of 8922 critically ill patients, 22. 6 % were hypomagnesemic. Hypomagnesemia was associated with an increased adjusted risk of mild lactic acidosis (odds ratio [OR] 1. 71, 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI] 1. 51 - 1. 94, P <. 001) and severe lactic acidosis (OR 1. 56, 95 %CI 1. 32 - 1. 84, P <. 001) than the reference quartile. The association between hypomagnesemia and mild lactic acidosis was stronger in those at risk of magnesium deficiency, including diabetics (OR 2. 02, 95 %CI 1. 51 - 2. 72, P <. 001) and alcoholics (OR 1. 92, 95 %CI 1. 16 - 3. 19, P =. 01). As an internal model control, hypokalemia was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Conclusions: Magnesium deficiency is a common finding in patients admitted to the ICU and is associated with lactic acidosis. Our findings support the biologic role of magnesium in metabolism and raise the possibility that hypomagnesemia is a correctable risk factor for lactic acidosis in critical illness...|$|R

The control group included 20 practically healthy persons. The parameters of heart rate turbulence, QT-interval duration, potassium, <b>magnesium,</b> calcium, <b>lactate</b> and pyruvate levels were determined. Results. A total calcium level in patients of Groups II and III increased by 27. 14 % (p< 0. 001) and 29. 41 % (p< 0. 001) compared to Group I, and ionized calcium level increased by 27. 14 % (p< 0. 001) and 27. 65 % (p< 0. 001), respectively. The level of potassium in Groups II and III was 20. 63 % (p< 0. 001) and 19. 59 % (p< 0. 001) lower than in Group I, and magnesium level was 14. 51 % (p< 0. 001) and 12. 69 % (p< 0. 001) lower compared to Group I. The level of pyruvate in Group II decreased by 60. 53 % (p< 0. 001), and in Group III it decreased by 54. 84 % (p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{ingestion}} of imidacloprid treated seeds by farmland birds {{may result in}} exposure to toxic amounts of this insecticide. Here {{we report on the}} effects that the exposure to the recommended application rate and to 20 % of that rate may produce on birds feeding on treated seeds. Experimental exposure to imidacloprid treated seeds was performed on red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) (n= 15 pairs per treatment group: control, 20 % or 100 % of the recommended application rate) during two periods that corresponded to the autumn (duration of exposure: 25 days) and late winter (10 days) cereal sowing times in Spanish farmlands. We studied effects on the survival, body condition, oxidative stress biomarkers, plasma biochemistry, carotenoid-based coloration, T-cell mediated immune response and reproduction of exposed adult partridges, and on the survival and T-cell immune response of their chicks. The high dose (recommended application rate) killed all partridges, with mortality occurring faster in females than in males. The low dose (20 % the recommended application rate) had no effect on mortality, but reduced levels of plasma biochemistry parameters (glucose, <b>magnesium</b> and <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase), increased blood superoxide dismutase activity, produced changes in carotenoid-based integument coloration, reduced the clutch size, delayed the first egg lay date, increased egg yolk vitamins and carotenoids and depressed T-cell immune response of chicks. Moreover, the analysis of the livers of dead partridges revealed an accumulation of imidacloprid during exposure time. Despite the moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids in the European Union, birds may still be at high risk of poisoning by these pesticides through direct sources of exposure to coated seeds in autumn and winter.

40|$|From a {{previous}} study {{it was concluded that}} intravenous infusion of sodium fluoride (NaF) in rats is a suitable model to study the toxicity of hydrofluoric acid. In this supplementary study we investigated the effect of intravenous infusion of a high and low dose of NaF (120 and 25 mg. kg - 1. hr - 1) on the plasma concentration of <b>lactate,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> potassium and inorganic phosphate. As compared to the control groups an increase of the lactate concentration in plasma was found, mainly in the terminal phase of the NaF infusion period. This indicates that the decrease of base excess which is frequently found in fluoride intoxications, is caused by tissue hypoxia following impaired circulation. The magnesium concentration in plasma decreased steadily during both NaF infusions. Because magnesium ions have an essential role in many enzymatic processes and because changes of the magnesium concentration in plasma exert hemodynamical effects further studies into the consequences of these finding seem justified. In the terminal stage of NaF infusion hyperkalemia was observed. From our experiments it is unclear whether this rise of the potassium concentration is due to fluoride itself, the treatment-induced acidosis, or that cell necrosis due to hypoperfusion is responsible for this increase. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine reference ranges for various constituents of hemolymph from visually healthy lobsters (Homarus americanus). Hemolymph was collected from the ventral sinus from 5 different groups of freshly caught, pound held or laboratory maintained animals. The mean weight and carapace length of these groups ranged from 298 to 614 grams and 72 to 90 cm respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: Up {{to one-third}} of {{patients}} with intra-ocular silicone oil (SO) tamponade for complex macula-on retinal detachment may experience an unexplained visual loss during or after SO tamponade. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, previous studies suggested that accumulation of retinal potassium could be involved. Hence, this study tested the hypothesis that intra-ocular potassium levels are elevated during SO tamponade. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out from 13 October 2013 through 5 March 2015. Potassium, sodium, <b>magnesium,</b> chloride, calcium, <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose levels were measured in retro-oil fluid and paired serum from 16 patients undergoing oil removal, including two patients with SO-related visual loss (SORVL). Vitreous humour and paired serum from 27 patients with macular hole (n = 19) or floaters (n = 8) served as controls. RESULTS: Median potassium levels in retro-oil fluid and vitreous humour were similar. Magnesium and chloride levels were lower in retro-oil fluid compared with vitreous humour (p < 0. 01) and LDH levels were elevated in retro-oil fluid (p < 0. 0001). One of the two patients with SORVL revealed abnormal high potassium and magnesium levels. The other patient had normal levels. CONCLUSION: Potassium levels are not increased in retro-oil fluid during SO tamponade, making the 'potassium accumulation' hypothesis unlikely. The disturbance in magnesium concentration during SO tamponade warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Metabolic {{acidosis}} during hemorrhagic shock {{is common}} and conventionally {{considered to be}} due to hyperlactatemia. There is increasing awareness, however, that other nonlactate, unmeasured anions contribute to this type of acidosis. Methods: Eleven anesthetized dogs were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 45 mm Hg and were kept at this level until a metabolic oxygen debt of 120 mLO 2 /kg body weight had evolved. Blood pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, <b>magnesium,</b> calcium, chloride, <b>lactate,</b> albumin, and phosphate were measured at baseline, in shock, and during 3 hours post-therapy. Strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated. To detect the presence of unmeasured anions, anion gap and strong ion gap were determined. Capillary electrophoresis was used to identify potential contributors to unmeasured anions. Results: During induction of shock, pH decreased significantly from 7. 41 to 7. 19. The transient increase in lactate concentration from 1. 5 to 5. 5 mEq/L during shock was not sufficient to explain the transient increases in anion gap (+ 11. 0 mEq/L) and strong ion gap (+ 7. 1 mEq/L), suggesting that substantial amounts of unmeasured anions must have been generated. Capillary electrophoresis revealed increases in serum concentration of acetate (2. 2 mEq/L), citrate (2. 2 mEq/L), alpha-ketoglutarate (35. 3 microEq/L), fumarate (6. 2 microEq/L), sulfate (0. 1 mEq/L), and urate (55. 9 microEq/L) after shock induction. Conclusion: Large amounts of unmeasured anions were generated after hemorrhage in this highly standardized model of hemorrhagic shock. Capillary electrophoresis suggested that the hitherto unmeasured anions citrate and acetate, but not sulfate, contributed significantly to the changes in strong ion gap associated with induction of shock...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{profile of}} dairy cows {{in the transition}} period during summer and winter was evaluated. Were used 31 crossbred Holstein/Gir cows at each season, totaling 62 cows. During summer they remained in pasture with supplementation of corn silage and concentrate and in the winter, corn silage and concentrate was offered to furnish the nutritional requirements. A total of 11 blood samples from each animal were taken according to the following protocol: four collections weekly antepartum, at birth and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 21 and 30 days postpartum. Concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium were evaluated. All analytes varied according to the physiological status. The average concentrations of calcium and magnesium were higher in summer than in winter. In both seasons, the lowest mean calcium concentrations occurred near calving, and 75 % of the animals in winter and 35. 48 % of the animals in the summer were hypocalcemic.

40|$|Both {{clinical}} and subclinical deficiency of calcium and magnesium may cause problems in dairy cows. Clinical hypocalcaemia most commonly occurs at calving and onset of lactation and {{is associated with}} milk fever, while clinical hypomagnesaemia occurs under certain dietary conditions. Factors affecting the calcium and magnesium status in dairy cows were examined in this thesis. The effect of dietary magnesium (0. 19 and 0. 43 % of dry matter) and potassium (1. 9, 2. 8, and 3. 7 % of dry matter) on magnesium digestibility and magnesium balance was assessed using a Latin square design with six lactating cows. The effect of supplying dietary calcium to dry cows (0. 49, 0. 93, and 1. 36 % of dry matter) on calcium and magnesium homeostasis was investigated in 29 periparturient cows. A case-control study was used to investigate whether mineral feeding during {{the last part of}} the dry period differed between 30 herds with high incidence of milk fever, and 22 herds with no milk fever. Finally, the effect of prepartum milking for 1 to 7 days on calcium homeostasis was investigated in 15 cows around calving. <b>Magnesium</b> uptake in <b>lactating</b> cows was found to depend on the level of dietary magnesium, but not on the potassium concentration. Dietary calcium had no effect on hypocalcaemia at calving, and was not different between herds with high milk fever incidence and herds without milk fever. However, high levels of calcium in the diet resulted in decreased magnesium absorption. High amounts of potassium in the diet were associated with increased risk of high milk fever incidence, while high amounts of dietary magnesium were associated with decreased risk of high milk fever incidence. Prepartum milking decreased plasma calcium levels and activated the calcium homeostatic mechanisms. However, there were no differences in the degree of hypo¬calcaemia at calving, and plasma concentration of calcium decreased within 1 h after calving, indicating that factors other than milk removal alone were responsible for the decrease in plasma calcium levels at calving. The conclusion was that cows should be fed high amounts of magnesium and low amounts of potassium during {{the last part of the}} dry period to avoid milk fever, while the potassium concentration in the diet of lactating cows is of less importance regarding magnesium uptake. Milk removal affects calcium homeostasis, but the effect on the risk of milk fever is unclear...|$|R
