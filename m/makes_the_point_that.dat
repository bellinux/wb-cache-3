5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that,</b> because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{even the best}} police of The Wire are motivated not {{by a desire to}} protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|As with Nero, it is {{possible}} that music from Florindo or Daphne was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The overture to the opera Rodrigo consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709–10 Handel composed the cantata Apollo e Dafne, which has common ground with the earlier operas. Harris <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the Florinda and Daphne music may have re-emerged: the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (1707); the opera Radamisto (1720); and the overture in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the overture to Florindo. This last-named has been combined with HWV352–354 and HWV356 to form the Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne, which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already {{knows how to do}} these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise outside simply a construction book. Vitruvius <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the work {{of some of the}} most talented are unknown, while many who are of lesser talent but greater political position are famous. This theme runs through Vitruvius’s ten books repeatedly – echoing an implicit prediction that his works and himself will also be unknown. Which was true for over a thousand years after he completed the 10 books.|$|E
25|$|This {{story begins}} with a {{conversation}} between an old man and a young traveler, Tomás Gomez. The older man explains that he came to Mars because he appreciates the new and novel. Even everyday things have become amazing to him once again. He has returned full circle to his childhood. Later, Tomás encounters a Martian named Muhe Ca. Each can see the Mars he is accustomed to, {{in his own time}} frame, but the other person is translucent to him and has the appearance of a phantom. The young man sees ruins where the Martian sees a thriving city, while the Martian sees an ocean where Tomás sees the new Earth settlement. Neither knows if he precedes the other in time, but Bradbury <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> any one civilization is ultimately fleeting.|$|E
500|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that the High Court also ruled that dual citizenship on its own will not be enough to disqualify someone under s 44(i). [...] At paragraph 176, the High Court <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a person must take reasonable steps to renounce their non-Australian citizenship.

Morley <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that,</b> like Coward, Gielgud's principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with [...] "low-maintenance" [...] long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another.

500|$|Carpenter sees in Potter's work {{thematic}} {{shifts from}} the early work onward. In {{the first stage of}} her work, he sees in stories such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in The Tale of Jeremy Fisher. Potter places Jeremy Fisher in a dangerous world, according to Carpenter. The fishing experience is frightening: the bank-side creatures [...] worry him, the stickleback threatens him directly, and the trout tries to swallow him. But Potter <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> all creatures are prey, ending the story with Jeremy Fisher himself eating a grasshopper smothered in lady-bird sauce.|$|E
50|$|Both Speck and Owen <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a building-centric {{standard}} such as LEED, which doesn't sufficiently {{account for}} the location in which the building stands, will inevitably undervalue the strong positive effect of people living together in cities, which are inherently environmentally efficient, especially {{when compared to the}} automobile-oriented sprawl.|$|R

500|$|Hair makes many {{references}} to Shakespeare's plays, especially Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet, and, at times, takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare. [...] For example, {{the lyrics to}} the song [...] "What a Piece of Work Is Man" [...] are from Hamlet (II:scene2) and portions of [...] "Flesh Failures" [...] ("the rest is silence") are from Hamlet's final lines. [...] In [...] "Flesh Failures/Let The Sun Shine In", the lyrics [...] "Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss" [...] are from Romeo and Juliet (V: iii, 111–14). [...] According to Miller, the Romeo suicide imagery <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that,</b> with our complicity in war, we are killing ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Zoe Detsi-Diamanti, in {{her book}} The Flesh Made Text Made Flesh, commented on the episode's {{depiction}} of race. She argues that the episode <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a [...] "perfectly normal" [...] black man looks a certain way, {{pointing out that the}} episode states that a black man is defined by a [...] "certain skin pigment". Any exception to this norm is depicted in a negative manner, with science being the only answer to unnatural phenomena. Dean Kowalski agreed with the analysis in The Philosophy of The X-Files, commenting that one of the main themes of the episodes revolved around science's attempt to explain folk theories and paranormal phenomena. The episode's antagonist Aboah, escapes the FBI by fitting into a dinner cart, a feat that was compared to slaves escaping in unconformable slave ships.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien vocally opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party {{prior to}} the Second World War, and was known to {{especially}} despise Nazi racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release The Hobbit in Nazi Germany. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of Aryan origin. In {{a letter to his}} British publisher Stanley Unwin, he condemned Nazi [...] "race-doctrine" [...] as [...] "wholly pernicious and unscientific". He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering [...] "letting a German translation go hang". He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Aryan" [...] is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of Indo-Iranian languages. He continued, ...|$|E
2500|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya often {{emphasizes}} Mae Ji Chandra's illiteracy, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{she became}} a spiritual leader solely because of her character and spiritual maturity, rather than academic knowledge.

5000|$|In 1 Corinthians 9:24-26, {{written to}} the city that hosted the Isthmian Games, the metaphor is {{extended}} from running to other games, such as boxing, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> winning a prize requires discipline, self-control, and coordinated activity. [...] In 2 Timothy 2:5 <b>the</b> same <b>point</b> is made. These athletic metaphors are also echoed in later Christian writing.|$|R
500|$|The {{concept of}} a lesbian {{identity}} is also explored throughout Journey to a Woman, as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself {{at the end of}} the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent the anguish of self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in Women in the Shadows. Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in Odd Girl Out and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to sustain [...] "a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery". Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.|$|E
500|$|There {{is also a}} {{reference}} to Catraeth in the slightly later poem Moliant Cadwallon, a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, {{thought to have been}} composed in about 633. Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as [...] "fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth". He identifies Gwallawc as the [...] "Guallauc" [...] {{who was one of the}} kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien. Koch draws attention to the mention of meibion Godebawc (the sons of Godebog) as an enemy in stanza 15 of the Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of [...] "Coïl Hen Guotepauc". He considers that, in view of the references in the three poems, there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat. This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c. 600 favoured by Williams and others. [...] He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Brythons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet, with Anglian allies on both sides, Rheged being in an alliance with Deira. He points out that according to the Historia Britonnum it was Rhun, son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanflæd of Deira, her father Edwin and 12,000 of his subjects in 626/7. Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle. Mynyddog Mwynfawr was not a person's name but a personal description meaning 'mountain feast' or 'mountain chief'. Some aspects of Koch's view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver Padel and Tim Clarkson. Clarkson, for example, <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the reference in Gweith Gwen Ystrat is to [...] "the men of Catraeth"; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth, and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus, not Rhun, who baptized the Deirans.|$|E
2500|$|Comparing {{the music}} of New Orleans with {{the music of}} Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans [...] "clave", a Spanish word meaning 'code' or 'key', as in {{the key to a}} puzzle, or mystery. Although {{technically}} the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.|$|E

Cott explains that ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{many stories}} point to Capillana’s life {{unfolding}} as expressed above, some authors <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Capillana is an augmentation {{of the word}} capullana which is the general term defining a Peruvian female ruler of the north. It {{is possible that the}} name Capillana was simply a metamorphosis of the term capullana by the Spanish conquistadors.|$|R
50|$|Peter Scott:Hicks {{draws on}} a range of {{theological}} resources to defend a normative Christian position that, in interaction with philosophical approaches, offers a sophisticated affirmation of equality and trenchant critique of inequality. Furthermore, he interprets a wealth of empirical studies to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Christians (with others) need to attend to the values operative within these empirical studies.|$|R
