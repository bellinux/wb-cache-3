Now, modern corporations must manage their activities in term of international, especially as to environment problem. Because natural environment does not have boader, <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> must be essentially international not only in mothercountry but also abroad. This paper will try to explain basic problems of international <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> (i. e., concept of international <b>environment</b> <b>management,</b> its feature and activities, etc.). Several facts on international <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> will been shown. The concept of international <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> is not different from national <b>environment</b> <b>management.</b> Offensive <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> is, however, necessary and important.

Because modern corporation {{is a member of}} citizen society, modern corporation has to make unecomonic and social contributions to society. Business management of modern corporation has now triple structure (i. e., production management, labor management, and corporate citizenship management). This article explains why the modern corporation must have triple system of management, especially corporate citizenship management; how system of an <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> must be; and what relationship between triple system of <b>management</b> and <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> is.

40|$|Modern {{corporation}} as an open adaptable {{system to}} its environment {{must have an}} <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> to live eternally in the modern civil society. So, the most important task of management is to develop the its own <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> system. This article explains that modern corporation must have a general <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> system; why modern corporation three <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> structures (i. e., production-, labour- and citizen-oriented <b>environment</b> <b>managements)</b> must have; and how production-oriented <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> or environment-oriented production management must be. To develop {{a model of the}} general <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> system, first, we must correctly understand the functional structure of corporation in vertical and horizontal viewpoints. Next, we must know what goals three structural managements must have and how to attain them. Finally, because modern corporation contains environmental functions into the every function of modern corporation, in vertical functions, top management has to decide environmental goals, strategies and environmental plan; middle management has to make operation plans from this environmental plan; and lower management has to realise this plans. In horizontal functions (i. e., production process, line and staff, and structure functions), environmental tasks must be suitably built in. General <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> has three structural managements (i. e., production-, labour- and citizen-oriented <b>environment</b> <b>managements.</b> We could refer to production-oriented <b>environment</b> <b>management</b> as environment-oriented production management. Its main object is to make its own products most efficiently in harmony with every environmental factors (stakeholders) ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{expansion}} of distributed multimedia applications, such as video-phone, video-conference, and video-on-demand, synchronization among various media (time-dependent, time-independent) becomes {{an integral part of}} various protocols, mechanisms and services in the underlying computing and communication systems. The current systems allow and provide two dierent resource <b>management</b> <b>environments</b> where synchronization will be considered: (1) best eort resource management, and (2) reservationbased resource management with dierentiation of service classes. Under these two resource <b>management</b> <b>environments,</b> our goal is to analyze and compare the design, implementation, and performance of synchronization protocols and services. Our approach to accomplish this complex analysis is inductive, because we select a representative protocol from each group, and consider an adaptive synchronization protocol on top of the best eort resource management and a reservation-based synchronization protoc [...] ...|$|R
