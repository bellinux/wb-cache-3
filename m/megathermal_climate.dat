5000|$|<b>Megathermal</b> <b>climates</b> are {{sometimes}} {{split into two}} temperature-based subsets [...] - [...] equatorial and tropical (the latter used here {{in the sense of}} [...] "outer tropical") [...] - [...] with [...] "equatorial" [...] denoting little or no variation in temperature throughout the year and [...] "tropical" [...] denoting significant seasonal variation, even though no month has an average temperature of below 18°C. In addition, what temperature fluctuations do exist in an equatorial climate will typically bear no relationship to the astronomical seasons for the applicable side of the equator, while in the (outer) tropical subtype the temperature will move in concert with the seasons, the time of higher sun and longer days being warmest and the time of lower sun and shorter days coolest.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is designed to}} carry out the annual and seasonal thermal classification of Pakistan to provide better understanding to all the stake holders like farmers and scientists etc for obtaining maximum crop yield. The data of Climatic Normal’s (1971 - 2000) has been used to calculate Thornthwaites’s Thermal efficiency index for thermal classification of Pakistan. The results of annual thermal classification reveals that Pakistan’s northern half experiences Tundra to Microthermal climate type and southern half experiences all types of Mesothermal to <b>Megathermal</b> <b>climate</b> type. Seasonal analysis showed large variations like in winters the whole country ranges from Microthermal to Frost Type of climate except the extremely southern parts of the country which have Mild Mesothermal climate. In spring the northern half of the country lies between Tundra to Microthermal climate and southern half from Mesothermal to <b>Megathermal</b> <b>climate.</b> During summer and monsoon majority of the regions in the country experience Megathermal except Northern areas which show Moderate Mesothermal to Mesothermal climate. The autumn season mostly have Mild Mesothermal to Tundra climate excluding southern half which showed Moderate Mesothermal to Mesothermal climate...|$|E

Detailed studies of the profile indicate that crop cultivation began at 7000 yr BP in the Neolithic and carried on to present in the area. Disturbance of the profile by cultivation has not masked evidence of changes in aeolian dust deposition and bio-pedogenic processes caused by climatic variations. Increased dust deposition indicates that a remarkable aridity phase occurred from 6000 to 5000 yr BP during the Holocene Megathermal (8500 – 3000 yr BP). The aridity and intensified aeolian dust deposition interrupted the formation of the brown soil developing under a warm-humid subtropical climate during the Megathermal. The palaeosol S 0, normally associated with the Megathermal period, is thus separated into two distinct soils, namely S 01 and S 02. This variability in <b>Megathermal</b> <b>climate</b> may have been widespread across northwestern China. It is also possible that the marked decline in Neolithic culture in the periods of the middle and late Yangshao Culture (6000 – 5000 yr BP) in the Guanzhong Basin {{can be attributed to the}} climatic aridity at the time...|$|E

40|$|Water {{and energy}} {{have emerged as}} the best {{contemporary}} environmental correlates of broad-scale species richness patterns. A corollary hypothesis of water–energy dynamics {{theory is that the}} influence of water decreases and the influence of energy increases with absolute latitude. We report the first use of geographically weighted regression for testing this hypothesis on a continuous species richness gradient that is entirely located within the tropics and subtropics. The dataset was divided into northern and southern hemispheric portions to test whether predictor shifts are more pronounced in the less oceanic northern hemisphere. American palms (Arecaceae, n = 547 spp.), whose species richness and distributions are known to respond strongly to water and energy, were used as a model group. The ability of water and energy to explain palm species richness was quantified locally at different spatial scales and regressed on latitude. Clear latitudinal trends in agreement with water–energy dynamics theory were found, but the results did not differ qualitatively between hemispheres. Strong inherent spatial autocorrelation in local modeling results and collinearity of water and energy variables were identified as important methodological challenges. We overcame these problems by using simultaneous autoregressive models and variation partitioning. Our results show that the ability of water and energy to explain species richness changes not only across large climatic gradients spanning tropical to temperate or arctic zones but also within <b>megathermal</b> <b>climates,</b> at least for strictly tropical taxa such as palms. This finding suggests that the predictor shifts ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} spatial {{patterns}} in biotic compositional variability in deep time {{is key to}} understanding the macroecological response of species assemblages to global change. Globally warm climatic phases are marked by the expansion of <b>megathermal</b> <b>climates</b> into currently extra-tropical areas. However, there is currently little information on whether vegetation in these ‘‘paratropical’’ regions resembled spatially modern tropical or extra-tropical biomes. In this paper we explore spatial heterogeneity in extra-tropical megathermal vegetation, using sporomorph (pollen and spore) data from the late Paleocene Calvert Bluff and Tuscahoma Formations of the formerly paratropical U. S. Gulf Coast (Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama). The data set comprises 139 sporomorph taxa recorded from 56 samples. Additive diversity partitioning, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis show compositional heterogeneity both spatially and lithologically within the U. S. Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP) microflora. We then use sporomorph data from Holocene lake cores to compare spatial patterns in the late Paleocene GCP with modern tropical and extra-tropical biomes. Distance decay analysis of the Holocene data reveals {{a higher rate of}} spatial turnover in tropical versus extratropical vegetation types, consistent with a latitudinal gradient in floral compositional heterogeneity. The specific combination of rate and scale dependency of distance decay in the Holocene assemblages prevented us from associating the late Paleocene GCP with any particular modern biome. Our results demonstrate the importance of spatial scale, taphonomy, and lithology in determining patterns of spatial heterogeneity, and show the potential of the fossil sporomorph record for studying spatial patterns and processes in deep time...|$|R
