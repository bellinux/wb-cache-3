40|$|Gas {{atomized}} <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders</b> {{are critical}} {{for the production of}} a wide variety of flares, tracer projectiles, and other munitions for the United States military, along with a growing number of applications in both alloying and powder metallurgy. Gas atomization of magnesium is performed by numerous companies worldwide, but represents a single point failure within the United States as there is only one domestic producer. These powders are pyrophoric and must be handled carefully and kept dry at all times. Recent studies have explored the ability of certain fluorine containing cover gases to protect molten magnesium in casting operations from excessive vaporization and burning by modifying the native oxide (MgO) through interaction with these gas atmospheres. The present study sought to adapt this melt protection strategy for use as an in-situ passivation technique that could be employed to form a protective reaction film during gas atomization of <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders.</b> This fluorinated oxide shell was intended to provide superior coverage and adherence to the underlying metal, which may improve the ability of powders to resist ignition at elevated temperatures and during powder handling. Two candidate gases were tested in this research, SF 6 and NF 3, and reaction films of both were produced on miniature melt samples in a controlled environment and characterized using auger electron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ultimately, SF 6 was chosen to conduct a small scale magnesium atomization experiment for verification of the fluorination reaction and to experimentally test the ignition temperature of these coated particles compared to other <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders</b> available today. This novel passivation technique was found to be far superior to magnesium 2 ̆ 7 s native oxide at resisting ignition and, thus, to reduce the hazard associated with handling and transport of <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders</b> for defense applications. If fully commercialized, this passivation method also may open up a new arena for powder metallurgy processing of structural parts from Mg and Mg alloy powders...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Magnesium {{has been}} {{considered}} as {{a new generation of}} bioactive and biodegradable implant for orthopaedic applications because of its prominent properties including superior biocompatibility, biodegradability and proper mechanical stiffness. For the direct production of custom biomedical implants, selective laser melting (SLM) has been investigated to fabricate pure magnesium and its resultant properties. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} identify the most appropriate mode of irradiation for the melting of pure <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders</b> due to its reactive properties. This study focuses on investigating the interaction between the laser source and the <b>magnesium</b> <b>powders</b> by varying the SLM parameters of the laser power and scan speed under continuous or pulse mode conditions. Design/methodology/approach - Single magnesium tracks were fabricated under different processing conditions using SLM, in order to evaluate the effects of processing parameters on the dimension and surface morphology of the achieved parts. The digital images of the tracks were used to analyze the geometrical features in terms of melting width and depth. In addition, scanning electron images were also studied to understanding the selective melting mechanism. Findings - Magnesium tracks were successfully fabricated using SLM. Results showed that the dimension, surface morphology and the oxygen pick-up of the laser-melted tracks are strongly dependent on the mode of irradiation and processing parameters. Originality/value - This work is a first step towards magnesium fabrication using SLM technique. The experimental results represent an important step in understanding the magnesium under an Nd:YAG laser irradiation, which provides the basis of behavior for follow-on research and experiments.
