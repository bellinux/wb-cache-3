We examined whether CNTF genotype differentially influences the effect of resistance training on neuromuscular improvement in male college students. Resistance training of the upper extremities comprised 3 sets at 75 %– 85 % intensity per 1 repetition maximum, 3 times a week, for a total of 8 weeks. We measured isokinetic muscle function of the elbow joint with regard to strength (60 °/s) and endurance (180 °/s) by using an isokinetic dynamometer. The biceps brachii (BB) and brachioradialis muscles were studied using surface electromyography with spike-triggered averaging to assess surface-detected motor unit potential (SMUP) area. After resistance training, the SMUP of the BB increased significantly at 60 °/s (p < 0. 05), but no difference in the CNTF genotype was observed. The SMUP of the BB at 180 °/s increased significantly in the GG/AA genotype group compared with that in the GA genotype group (p < 0. 05). The average power of the elbow flexor at 180 °/s increased significantly after resistance training (p < 0. 05), but again, no difference in the CNTF genotype was observed. Thus, improvements in muscle strength and endurance may have resulted directly from resistance training rather than from genetic factors related to nerves in muscle tissue...|$|R

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined all studies directly comparing linear and undulating periodized resistance training programs to determine and compare their effects on muscular strength. A systematic search of the MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and SPORTDiscus databases revealed 17 studies satisfying the inclusion criteria. There were a total of 510 participants in the included studies. Sixteen studies reported significant increases in strength for both periodization approaches. Five studies reported significant differences in improvements between groups. The meta-analyses determined that there were no differences in the effectiveness of linear vs. undulating periodization on upper-body or lower-body strength. The short-term nature of studies and the previous training history of participants were identified as potential confounding factors in the interpretation of findings. The results suggest that novelty or training variety are important for stimulating further strength development.

40|$|Gastrectomy (GX) {{is thought}} to result in osteomalacia due to {{deficiencies}} in Vitamin D and Ca. Using a GX rat model, we showed that GX induced high turnover of bone with hyperosteoidosis, prominent increase of mineralization and increased mRNA expression of both osteoclast-derived tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 b and osteocalcin. The increased 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 level and unchanged PTH and calcitonin levels suggested that conventional bone and Ca metabolic pathways were not involved or changed in compensation. Thus, GX-induced bone pathology was different from a typical osteomalacia. Gene expression profiles through microarray analysis and data mining using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that 612 genes were up-regulated and 1, 097 genes were down-regulated in the GX bone.

40|$|Neutral {{factors have}} been found to play a {{significant}} role in human <b>muscular</b> strength <b>development,</b> as evidenced by quantitative changes in electromyographic activity recorded during maximum voluntary contractions. These changes are suggestive of an altered pattern of motor unit firing in that the coincidence of several motor units firing at one and the same time is greater than could be accounted for by chance alone. Further, our experiments have shown that this altered pattern of firing is not commensurate with the electromyographic pattern associated with muscular fatigue. Whereas altered spinal reflex activity accounts for much of the fatigue pattern, long loop reflexes appear to be an important factor in strength adaptation. These findings are based on a series of studies in which young adult subjects were trained on an isokinetic dynamometer for 4 - 6 weeks, with voluntary and involuntary (Hoffmann, tendon, and stretch reflex) responses being recorded prior to and after the training period. Electromyographic signals were subjected to power spectral analysis and examined for significant shifts in the spectrum. Typically greater power was observed in the lower frequencies (less than 80 Hz) following strength training, this being indicative of motor unit synchronization. Computer simulations of neuro-muscular activity also supported these findings...|$|R

To investigate the mechanisms by which androgens exert their effects via the AR in mineralizing osteoblasts and osteocytes, we identified gene targets/pathways regulated by the AR using targeted gene expression and microarray approaches on bone isolated from mice in which the AR is specifically deleted in mineralizing osteoblasts and osteocytes (mOBL-ARKOs). Gene ontology mining indicated a number of biological processes to be affected in the bones of mOBL-ARKOs including skeletal and <b>muscular</b> system <b>development</b> and carbohydrate metabolism. All genes identified to have altered expression in the bones of mOBL-ARKOs were confirmed by Q-PCR for their androgen responsiveness in an androgen deprivation and replacement mouse model. The osteoblast genes Col 1 a 1 and Bglap and the osteoclast genes Ctsk and RANKL (Tnfs 11) were upregulated in the bones of mOBL-ARKOs, consistent with the increased matrix synthesis, mineralization, and bone resorption observed previously in these mice.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} kinematic, kinetic and performance changes that occur in the serve throughout a prolonged tennis match play. Serves of eight male advanced tennis players were recorded with a motion capture system before, at mid-match, and after a 3 -hour tennis match. Before and after each match, electromyographic data of 8 upper limb muscles obtained during isometric maximal voluntary contraction were compared to determine the presence of muscular fatigue. Vertical ground reaction forces, rating of perceived exertion, ball speed, and ball impact height were measured. Kinematic and upper limb kinetic variables were computed. The results show decrease in mean power frequency values for several upper limb muscles that is an indicator of local muscular fatigue. Decreases in serve ball speed, ball impact height, maximal angular velocities and an increase in rating of perceived exertion were also observed between the beginning and the end of the match. With fatigue, the majority of the upper limb joint kinetics decreases at the end of the match. No change in timing of maximal angular velocities was observed between the beginning and the end of the match. A prolonged tennis match play may induce fatigue in upper limb muscles, which decrease performance and cause changes in serve maximal angular velocities and joint kinetics. The consistency in timing of maximal angular velocities suggests that advanced tennis players are able to maintain the temporal pattern of their serve technique, in spite of the <b>muscular</b> fatigue <b>development...</b>|$|R
