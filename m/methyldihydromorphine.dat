50|$|<b>Methyldihydromorphine</b> (dihydroheterocodeine) is a semi-synthetic opioid {{originally}} developed in Germany in 1936, controlled under both domestic law and UN conventions {{because of its}} possible potential for abuse. <b>Methyldihydromorphine</b> is related to heterocodeine {{and is not a}} synonym for dihydrocodeine. Its structure suggests that it is six to nine times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than dihydrocodeine.|$|E
5000|$|Heterocodeine is 6 {{times more}} potent than {{morphine}} due {{to having a}} substitution at the 6-hydroxy position, {{in a similar manner}} to 6-acetylmorphine. [...] The drug <b>methyldihydromorphine</b> (dihydroheterocodeine) is a derivative of heterocodeine. Like the morphine metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide, 6-position branches (esters or ethers) of morphine bind to the otherwise unagonized human mu receptor subtype mu-3 (or Î¼3); as well as the 6-acetylmorphine metabolite of heroin this includes heterocodeine.|$|E
