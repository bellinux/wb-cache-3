25|$|In Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, Kelly {{suggests}} that knowledge {{may have been}} originally preserved by the nomadic Britons by using the landscape as a mnemonic tool, {{in a similar fashion}} to the memorization technique known as Method of loci. As the Britons started to settle, they would have needed to modify the way they stored their knowledge as they were not moving as <b>much</b> <b>anymore,</b> so they would have built Stonehenge in an attempt to replicate the landscape locally, allowing them to memorize and store knowledge. The circles and stones or timber posts would have represented the landscape, and each stone would have been associated with a segment of their knowledge system.|$|E
