5000|$|<b>Macedonians</b> (Μακεδόνες, Makedónes) are a {{regional}} and historical population group of ethnic Greeks, inhabiting or originating from the Greek region of Macedonia, in Northern Greece.

5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic <b>Macedonian</b> nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate <b>Macedonian</b> position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate <b>Macedonian</b> positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the <b>Macedonian</b> nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique <b>Macedonian</b> language as well. They thus emphasize that the <b>Macedonian</b> language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Makedonsko Devojče 2 (in <b>Macedonian</b> Cyrillic: Македонско девојче 2, {{meaning in}} English: <b>Macedonian</b> Girl 2) is the eighth studio album by <b>Macedonian</b> singer Karolina Gočeva {{released}} on 25 February 2014. Avalon Production launched the album in Macedonia, while Croatian label Dallas Records released it throughout former Yugoslav countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova; the arrangement and production were completed by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski. Except for those eight songs, two cover versions are also included, {{one of them}} being of a <b>Macedonian</b> traditional song {{and the other one}} of a record originally performed by <b>Macedonian</b> singer Pepi Baftiroski. For Gočeva, the motivation to record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her previous project inspired by the <b>Macedonian</b> traditional music, Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>Macedonian</b> language, a south Slavic language, is {{unrelated}} to the Ancient <b>Macedonian</b> language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language {{can be found in}} the terminology by group section and in the article <b>Macedonian</b> language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a <b>Macedonian</b> language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Macedonian</b> kings, who wielded {{absolute}} power and commanded state {{resources such as}} gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a <b>Macedonian</b> navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet <b>Macedonian</b> rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of <b>Macedonian</b> kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the <b>Macedonian</b> commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{structure}} of the Ancient <b>Macedonian</b> army was the division between the companion cavalry (hetairoi) and the foot companions (pezhetairoi), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon. <b>Macedonian</b> cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War, at times siding with either Athens or Sparta. <b>Macedonian</b> infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen. As evidenced by early 4th century BC artwork, there was a pronounced Spartan influence on the <b>Macedonian</b> army before PhilipII. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that {{at the beginning of}} PhilipII's reign in 359BC, the <b>Macedonian</b> army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, yet Malcolm Errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism.|$|E

An early 4th-century BC stone-carved relief from Pella shows a <b>Macedonian</b> infantryman wearing a pilos helmet and wielding a short sword showing a pronounced Spartan influence on the <b>Macedonian</b> army before Philip II. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip II's reign in 359 BC, the <b>Macedonian</b> army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, the latter figure similar to that recorded for the 5th century BC. However, Malcolm Errington cautions that any figures for <b>Macedonian</b> troop sizes provided by ancient authors should be treated with a degree of skepticism, since there are very few means by which modern historians are capable of confirming their veracity (and could have been possibly lower or even higher than the amount stated).|$|E

5|$|The ethnic <b>Macedonian</b> {{rulers of}} the Ptolemaic and Seleucid {{successor}} states accepted men {{from all over the}} Greek world as their hetairoi companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their <b>Macedonian</b> origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship, the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to <b>Macedonian</b> cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and <b>Macedonian</b> colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Macedonia is {{commonly}} split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the <b>Macedonian</b> Question.

5|$|Young <b>Macedonian</b> {{men were}} {{typically}} expected {{to engage in}} hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the <b>Macedonian</b> state. The <b>Macedonian</b> economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic <b>Macedonian</b> lifestyle {{during the course of}} the 5thcenturyBC.|$|E

5|$|According to Diodorus, the <b>Macedonian</b> army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians.

5|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, the ensuing {{wars of the}} Diadochi, and the {{partitioning}} of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Kingdom of Pergamon. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles {{for control of the}} territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the <b>Macedonian</b> Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third <b>Macedonian</b> War in 168BC, the <b>Macedonian</b> monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth <b>Macedonian</b> War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the <b>Macedonian</b> {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The <b>Macedonian</b> army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the <b>Macedonian</b> army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>Macedonians</b> {{emigrated to}} Canada as [...] "pečalbari" [...] (seasonal workers) {{in the mid}} 19th and early 20th century. Thousands of <b>Macedonians</b> emigrated to Canada after {{the failure of the}} Ilinden Uprising.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>Macedonians</b> in Britain arrived after the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia permitted emigration to the West in the 1960s and 1970s. Many <b>Macedonians</b> {{especially from the}} Demir Hisar, Bitola and Prilep regions left for Britain during this period. During the 1980s many professionals left Skopje to work in London for the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and for international organisations stationed there. Following the Breakup of Yugoslavia hundreds of ethnic <b>Macedonians</b> left for Britain. After the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s many ethnic <b>Macedonians</b> and Albanians from the newly independent Republic of Macedonia left for Britain as refugees.|$|R
50|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} <b>Macedonians</b> before World War II {{differed from the}} distribution of other Greek settlers. While the Greeks from the islands settled mainly in the eastern states of the country attracting more Greek immigrants there, large portions of <b>Macedonians</b> were concentrated in western Australia. During {{the first years of}} their settlement, the <b>Macedonians</b> were dispersed in the Australian countryside close to the metropolitan centers, working as market gardeners, farmhands and woodcutters; there was a significant change of their occupational patterns after 1946, when they began to bring with them their families from Greece. The urbanization process for the <b>Macedonians</b> started after the Great Depression, when the availability of work in urban areas increased, something that led to extended move of <b>Macedonians</b> towards the large cities, especially Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, where they set up their own communities and regional institutions. While the majority of the settlers were indigenous <b>Macedonians,</b> there were also small numbers of Pontic Greeks coming from the region of Macedonia, who did not share the same regional identity and founded distinct institutions.|$|R
