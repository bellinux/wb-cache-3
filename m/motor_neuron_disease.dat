25|$|Mutations in {{the first}} SOD enzyme (SOD1) can cause {{familial}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a form of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease).</b> The most common mutation in the U.S. is A4V, while the most intensely studied is G93A. The other two isoforms of SOD have not been linked to any human diseases, however, in mice inactivation of SOD2 causes perinatal lethality and inactivation of SOD1 causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutations in SOD1 can cause familial ALS (several pieces of evidence also show that wild-type SOD1, under conditions of cellular stress, is implicated in a significant fraction of sporadic ALS cases, which represent 90% of ALS patients.), by a mechanism that is presently not understood, but not due to loss of enzymatic activity or {{a decrease in the}} conformational stability of the SOD1 protein. Overexpression of SOD1 has been linked to the neural disorders seen in Down syndrome. In patients with thalassemia, SOD will increase as a form of compensation mechanism. However, in the chronic stage, SOD {{does not seem to be}} insufficient and tends to decrease due to the destruction of proteins from the massive reaction of oxidant-antioxidant.|$|E
