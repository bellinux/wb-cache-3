5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely <b>macerating</b> it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Unconditioned and <b>macerated</b> alfalfa samples at {{approximately}} 55 and 80 % moisture wet basis (w. b.) were incubated at 11 and 31 °C for 48 h {{and rates of}} CO 2 respired from each sample were measured. Production of CO 2 from unconditioned alfalfa samples appeared {{to be due to}} plant cell respiration while production of CO 2 from the <b>macerated</b> alfalfa samples appeared to be due primarily to microbial growth. Typically, the initial respiration rates of the <b>macerated</b> samples were less than the control samples. When the samples were incubated at 31 °C, the rates of CO 2 production from the <b>macerated</b> samples increased exponentially to approximately four times that of the control samples 6 to 20 h after the samples had been <b>macerated.</b> Consequently, the cumulative loss of DM from the <b>macerated</b> samples during the first 12 h of incubation was less than that of the control samples; however, after 12 h of incubation, loss of DM from the <b>macerated</b> samples increased to nearly twice the level of the control samples. At 11 °C, DM losses over 48 h in the <b>macerated</b> treatments were lower than the corresponding control treatments in three of four cases...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{addition}} of herbs into hot sesame oil {{could increase the}} oil-pulling efficiency of sesame oil. The aim of {{present study was to}} modify the proportion of herbs and sesame oil with the {{addition of}} other ingredients including menthol, camphor, and borneol and improve the medicinal properties and the scent of the oil. Methods: <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil was prepared by heat extraction of five species of herbs (Zingiber cassumunar, Zingiber zerumbet, Plantago major Linn, Citrus hystrix, and Amomum biflorum) with hot sesame oil. The study was performed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial properties of this <b>macerated</b> herbal oil. Results: <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil was evaluated for antioxidant activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. It was shown that at dilution 1 : 2 in DMSO, the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil had DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities equal to 63 % and 22 %, respectively. <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil dilution 1 : 8 in DMSO demonstrated ferric reducing capacity equivalent to ascorbic acid (0. 208 µM) and had reducing power equivalent to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) 7. 41 µg/mL. MTT assay was performed using immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) as a cell culture model. The result indicated that the cytotoxic concentration of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil was ≥ 2. 5 µL/mL in complete DMEM. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated using the nitrite assay and RT-PCR. It was found that the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil could inhibit nitrite accumulation in culture media. Change in the expression of COX- 2, Nrf 2, and NF-kB in RT-PCR confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil. Conclusion: It could be concluded that the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil could inhibit nitrite accumulation in culture media, which might be the inhibitory effect of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil on COX- 2 or Nrf 2, the downstream modulator of the COX- 2 pathway. Further intensive studies are needed for the optimization before bringing this <b>macerated</b> herbal oil into clinical application...|$|R
6000|$|It will be {{perceived}} that this doctrine {{is by no}} means identical with Abiogenesis, with which it is often confounded. On this hypothesis, a piece of beef, or a handful of hay, is dead only in a limited sense. The beef is dead ox, and the hay is dead grass; but the [...] "organic molecules" [...] of the beef or the hay are not dead, but are ready to manifest their vitality as soon as the bovine or herbaceous shrouds in which they are imprisoned are rent by the <b>macerating</b> action of water. The hypothesis therefore must be classified under Xenogenesis, rather than under Abiogenesis. Such as it was, I think it will appear, to those who will be just enough to remember that it was propounded before the birth of modern chemistry, and of the modern optical arts, to be a most ingenious and suggestive speculation.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in this}} field, and not in {{literature}} or philosophy, that Greg's interests were most actively aroused during his university career. When {{his life as a}} student came to an end, he returned home with his whole faculties of curiosity and enthusiasm concentrated upon natural history, phrenology, and animal magnetism. 'I have a canine appetite for natural history,' he told his brother in 1828. He describes with all the zeal of a clever youth of nineteen how busily he is employed in <b>macerating</b> skulls, dissecting unsavoury creatures before breakfast, watching the ants reduce a viper to a skeleton for him, and striving with all his might to get a perfect collection of animal and human skulls.

60|$|Similarly {{with respect}} to nutriment. There are entozoa which, living in the insides of other animals, and being {{constantly}} bathed by nutritive fluids, absorb a sufficiency through their outer surfaces; and so have no need of stomachs, and do not possess them. But all other animals, inhabiting media {{that are not in}} themselves nutritive, but only contain masses of food here and there, must have appliances by which these masses of food may be utilized. Evidently mere external contact of a solid organism with a solid portion of nutriment, could not result in the absorption of it in any moderate time, if at all. To effect absorption, there must be both a solvent or <b>macerating</b> action, and an extended surface fit for containing and imbibing the dissolved products: there must be a digestive cavity. Thus, given the ordinary conditions of animal life, and the possession of stomachs by all creatures living under these conditions may be deductively known.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a <b>macerated</b> stillborn fetus. Accurate genotyping {{of such a}} fetus may, however, be critical for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and appropriate genetic counseling. In the East Flanders Prospective Twin Study, placental tissue of twin and triplet sets, in some of which one or both members were stillborn and <b>macerated,</b> has been stored at - 20 degrees C. Of all these fetuses, sex and zygosity could be determined accurately on the placental deoxyribonucleic acid. We tested the possibility of nongenetic changes in deoxyribonucleic acid that result from maceration or tissue degradation over time in storage on placental samples from monochorionic twins in which only one member was stillborn and <b>macerated.</b> The deoxyribonucleic acid variants in these monozygotic twins were identical whether or not either cotwin was <b>macerated.</b> Thus deoxyribonucleic acid variants can be determined accurately on the placental tissue of <b>macerated</b> fetuses, even after prolonged freezing. status: publishe...|$|R

Overall, silage made from <b>macerated</b> alfalfa contained more ash (suggesting improved soil contamination); greater fiber and lower nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) content suggested greater fermentation in the silo. In a digestion study, two diets were fed containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 72 % of either control or <b>macerated</b> second-cutting alfalfa. Apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was increased by maceration, and similar changes in digestibility were observed with Yb or indigestible ADF as marker; indigestible ADF {{was used as a}} marker in later studies.
