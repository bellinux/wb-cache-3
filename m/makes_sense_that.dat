25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E
25|$|With toys {{comprising}} such a {{large and}} important part of human existence, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the toy industry would have a substantial economic impact. Sales of toys often increase around holidays where gift-giving is a tradition. Some of these holidays include Christmas, Easter, Saint Nicholas Day, and Three Kings Day.|$|E
25|$|Romanization is {{most useful}} to {{individuals}} who lack training in Mandarin but encounter names and terms in press reports and literature. Students of Mandarin gain literacy in Chinese characters and drop romanization systems of any kind. It, therefore, <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that,</b> if possible, one should enable a confident first-time pronunciation of Mandarin words by outsiders.|$|E

50|$|According to Tacitus, however, Suillius's accusations did {{not hold}} up under scrutiny. It would <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Seneca's {{position}} of power would make him vulnerable to trumped-up charges, as many public figures were at the time.|$|R
25|$|Some {{pairs of}} Traditional and Simplified are also {{considered}} to be semantic variants. According to Unicode's definitions, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their homophony) will {{be a form of}} semantic variant. Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104)and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be semantic variants of each other.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{important}} differences between the Masoretic and Samaritan version of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like {{the inclusion of a}} passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mt. Gerizim, and says plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> this passage is in one version and not the other.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{morphological}} differences between queens and workers of P. sericea. Generally, queens {{are larger than}} workers in the abdominal region, but have smaller head width and wing length. Queens {{are the only ones}} with well-developed ovarioles, mature oocytes and sperm-filled spermathecae. Workers' ovaries are either underdeveloped or not developed at all, and so they are not reproductive. Queens perform the reproductive tasks of the colony, while workers forage for resources such as food and nest-building materials. Thus, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> workers would have larger brains and wings because they must hunt and forage for food. The morphological differences seen in this caste differentiation are also seen with the species Protopolybia chartergoides and Polybia rejecta.|$|E

5000|$|ADAR1 is an {{interferon}} ( [...] IFN [...] )-inducible protein (one {{released by}} a cell {{in response to}} a pathogen or virus), so it would <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it would assist with a cell’s immune pathway. This seems to be true for the HCV replicon, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis LCMV, and polyomavirus ...|$|R

[...] "It's all about physical evidence... ancient pyramids don't build themselves." [...] Feder claimed that pseudoarcheologists lack the training to do a professional job evaluating items they may find.|$|R
25|$|The migratory {{ability is}} ranked {{tertiary}} > secondary > aryl > primary. Allylic groups {{are more apt}} to migrate than primary alkyl groups but less so than secondary alkyl groups. Electron-withdrawing groups on the substituent decrease the rate of migration. There are two explanations for this trend in migration ability. One explanation relies on the buildup of positive charge in the transition state for breakdown of the Criegee intermediate (illustrated by the carbocation resonance structure of the Criegee intermediate). Keeping this structure in mind, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the substituent that can maintain positive charge the best would be most likely to migrate. The higher the degree of substitution, the more stable a carbocation generally is. Therefore, the tertiary > secondary > primary trend is observed.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the very thing that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began {{investigating}} {{manipulations of}} X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately {{linked to the}} X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as X-inactivation, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} “lyonization”. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of tortoiseshell cats. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell. Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.|$|E

He concluded: [...] "His research is certain to spark fierce debate and spirited discussion.

500|$|Drake has a {{distinct}} personality, as the creators did {{not want him to}} appear as a caricature or [...] "cardboard cutout". Hennig constantly elaborated Drake's personality through in-game dialogue and interactions with other characters, rather than exclusively through cutaway scenes. Drake reacts to events in a human-like way, often commenting and complaining on the absurdity or difficulty of his situation. While traveling through chapters, Drake frequently makes sarcastic quips and taunts. Self-educated in history and various languages, Drake is also highly intelligent. Matt Casamassina of IGN commented on the character's interactions during gameplay that reveal Drake's nature: [...] "it's lighthearted and amusing, but it also demonstrates that Nate is aware of how absurd his predicaments sometimes are. It's a small, unimportant communication, but it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the two would behave exactly as they do." ...|$|E
500|$|Wood {{said that}} she is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|In First Contact, the {{individually}} inscrutable and faceless Borg {{fulfill the}} role of the similarly unreadable whale in Melville's work. Picard, like Ahab, has been hurt by his nemesis, and author Elizabeth Hinds said it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Picard should [...] "opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight" [...] the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left, to destroy the ship. Several lines in the film refer to the 21st-century dwellers being primitive, with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society. In the end it is Lily (the 21st-century woman) who shows Picard (the 24th-century man) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use. Lily's words cause Picard to reconsider, and he quotes Ahab's words of vengeance, recognizing the death wish embedded therein.|$|E

500|$|The film opened theatrically on February 14, 2003, on 3,471 {{screens in}} North America and took {{first place in}} its opening weekend, {{grossing}} $45,033,454. At the time, it became the second biggest February release, behind Hannibal. By the second weekend the film saw a 55.1% decline in takings but managed to maintain the number one spot, beating new release Old School by $639,093. By the third weekend release, Daredevil saw a further 38.5% drop in sales, and so fell to third place at the box office. The film grossed over $102 million in North America, and over $76 million {{in the rest of}} the world, totalling the film's worldwide takings at just over $179 million, grossing over double its budget of $78 million. Avi Arad addressed the top spot success by saying [...] "we are five for five with record-breaking box office successes [...] and have two more Marvel releases slated for this summer [...] It's a testament to the broad appeal of these characters before mainstream audiences outside of the core comic fans. These super heroes have been successful within the Marvel pantheon for decades; it only <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> their translations to the big screen are just as fruitful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, {{connections}} between computing and radical art {{began to grow}} stronger. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that Alan Kay and his co-workers at Xerox PARC began to give the computability of a personal computer to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. [...] "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and computer design.

2500|$|Remark: Some intuition for {{the mean}} ergodic theorem can be {{developed}} by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which {{we think of as}} U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the [...] limit just described).|$|E
2500|$|According to the Canadian Jewish Congress CEO Bernie Farber, {{the events}} of the Holocaust require a special focus, because they redefined the limits of [...] "human depravity" [...] and {{challenged}} the foundation of our civilization. “The Holocaust was also the foundation for our modern human rights legislation, and it makes perfect sense that the Holocaust should have a permanent place in the museum. It also <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the plight of Canada’s First Nations should also have a prominent place in the museum.
