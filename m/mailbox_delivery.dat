25|$|With {{centralized}} mail delivery, {{a central}} community mail station consisting of multiple mailboxes is located within or near a building or {{in a particular}} neighborhood. Known variously as group mailboxes, cluster mailboxes, or community mail stations, these mailboxes are often used in newer construction in place of door-to-door or curbside <b>mailbox</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Users {{would be}} able to send {{documents}} directly to other users simply by dropping the address on the document, or vice versa, bypassing a [...] "message" [...] at all [...] - [...] the document would arrive, by itself, in the other user's <b>mailbox.</b> <b>Delivery</b> of e-mail (which in this scenario {{is nothing more than a}} text document in a specialized format), or of anything else for that matter, was handled entirely by plug-ins, allowing the user to collect mail from all of their sources and collect it into a single inbox.|$|E
50|$|Flagtown {{has its own}} {{post office}} (ZIP code 08821) but no house-to-house <b>mailbox</b> <b>delivery,</b> {{therefore}} residents have no other option than to have a P.O. box address. Some residents (on the main streets, not the side streets) {{have the option to}} have home delivery if they accept Hillsborough as their postal address. Prior to the Hillsborough post office's existence, Neshanic previously had covered partial Flagtown home delivery. The Flagtown post office is especially small (despite some expansion work done within the last 10 years), and usually manned by one or two workers at any given time, who take care of all jobs themselves. It can be uncomfortably crowded in the p.o. box foyer/window area if a mere 4-5 customers are in line, or retrieving mail from their boxes. There's very limited parking, as the post office is part of an apartment/storefront, sharing the building with a small local deli and two residential apartments. A gas station/car repair shop, a separate building, shares the parking lot.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of its}} history, Lupton City had a post office. Homes in the {{community}} did not have <b>mailboxes</b> or residential <b>delivery,</b> so residents picked up their mail at the post office, which used ZIP code 37351. In 2006 the post office was closed temporarily due to structural problems with the building that housed it, and residents were instructed to get their mail at the Hixson post office. The U.S. Postal Service and the building owner provided money {{to the city of}} Chattanooga to buy mailboxes for Lupton City postal customers, and the post office closed permanently on July 18, 2009.|$|R
40|$|In December 2013, Canada Post {{announced}} {{they would be}} converting approximately five million households from door-to-door mail delivery to community mailboxes (CMB). The {{decision was made to}} address decreasing letter mail volume and operating losses experienced by the crown corporation. The CMBs will be phased in over the five years mainly in urban areas across the country. The decision to convert to CMBs makes Canada the only among the G 8 countries to end home delivery of mail. As a result, no research exists on the implications of the change. Particular concern has been raised over how the conversion will affect older adults. One area that needs examination is the consequences of the CMBs delivery model on fall rates among older adults in the winter. Falls are common among seniors, with 20 - 30 % community dwelling older adults falling each year. The risk of falling is increased in the winter when there is snow and ice on the ground. Injuries dues to falls consume a great deal of healthcare resources. The purpose of this scoping literature review was to determine: What are the implications for the elderly population of Canada Postâ€™s decision to convert home delivery of mail to community <b>mailbox</b> <b>delivery?</b> Specifically, the review focused on how the conversion may impact fall rates among older adults in the winter...|$|E
