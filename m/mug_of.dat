5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying Spaghetti Monster's de facto brand image. The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy <b>Mug</b> <b>of</b> Grog, performed in December 2008. This communal activity {{attracted the attention of}} three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May Worsley advised Shackleton that {{he could}} not be sure of their {{position}} within ten miles. To avoid the possibility of being swept past the island by the fierce south-westerly winds, Shackleton ordered a slight change of course so that the James Caird would reach land on the uninhabited south-west coast. They would then try to work the boat round to the whaling stations on the northern side of the island. [...] "Things were bad for us in those days", wrote Shackleton. [...] "The bright moments were those when we each received our one <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> hot milk during the long, bitter watches of the night". Late on the same day floating seaweed was spotted, and the next morning there were birds, including cormorants which were known never to venture far from land. Shortly after noon on 8 May came the first sighting of South Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E

He belonged to an elegant and {{affluent}} family and had studied at Prussian universities. He was chosen as prefect because of his knowledge and experience. During his term of office, he visited the canton of Dinklage. On one such visit in August 1812, he stayed at the Mäkel Inn. The proprietor served the prefect and his companions [...] "6 <b>mugs</b> <b>of</b> Brantwein at 28 Grs., 59 Glasses of Brantwein at 1½ Grs., and 80 <b>mugs</b> <b>of</b> beer at 3 Grs." ...|$|R

500|$|Former Postmaster General Amos Kendall, {{who managed}} Van Buren's {{re-election}} campaign, instructed that Democrats should {{not try to}} defend the administration, but should focus on attacking the opposing party's presidential candidate. [...] By the end of May 1840, Harrison had made no public appearances that year. Even {{though there was a}} custom that presidential contenders did not campaign, he was still mocked by the Democratic press. One article alleged he had been shut up in an iron cage with a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> hard cider, and that he was seeking help from the abolitionists to get released. As was usual for candidates of that era, he made his views known by answering letters from citizens, knowing that some would be reprinted in newspapers. However, Harrison felt that he needed to speak out, and accepted an invitation to make an address at the June 13 anniversary of the 1813 Siege of Fort Meigs, where he and his troops had held out against British and Native American forces. En route to Perrysburg, when leaving his hotel in Columbus, he made what Shafer called [...] "the first presidential campaign speech in history", speaking to a small crowd of supporters, and defending his record against what he deemed personal attacks. In his Fort Meigs speech, Harrison told the crowd, [...] "See that the Government does not acquire too much power. Keep check upon your rulers. Do this, and liberty is safe." [...] Harrison had planned additional speeches, but his swing was cut short when news arrived of the death of his son Benjamin from tuberculosis. He returned home {{to take care of his}} wife, and did not make another speech until July 28.|$|E

2500|$|One classic hack {{involved}} {{a police car}} with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car {{was found to be}} a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was pi. [...] Its license plate read [...] "IHTFP", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. [...] A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> coffee and a box of donuts. [...] Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the Stata Center as an all-time classic.|$|E

Drummond outlined their idea—which mirrors [...] "Whitney Joins The JAMs"—in a chapter of his book 45 entitled [...] "Robbie Joins The Jams": [...] "Over a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> tea Jimmy [...] and I got it all worked out. [...] We would record our version of 'The Magnificent Seven', renamed 'The Magnificent One', through Sunday night. Over the track I would beseech Robbie Williams to join The Jams, and then Robbie would in fact turn up at the studio {{in the early hours}} of Monday morning and make his creative contribution to the record." ...|$|E

But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer and a bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?" [...] The Russian proudly replies: [...] "Russians are not aggressors!" [...] (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel's being constantly afraid of being seen as the [...] "aggressor".) ...|$|E

Yallop could be dull; if Dean Jones set the pulses of Melbourne grandmothers racing {{like a couple of}} shandies over lunch, then Yallop was the comforting <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> Milo who put them back to sleep. He was decidedly more at home when the spinners were on. He was also, {{especially}} at his 1983 peak, the epitome of rocklike solidity. And yes, he was a fatally flawed, forlorn captain... He was unimaginative, tactically unsophisticated and lacked the respect of his players. And because he had predicted they would win 6–0, in the dumbest press conference any Australian captain ever gave... More than anyone, Yallop suffered from the chaos of ... He was used and abused at every turn. He is not the only Australian batsman of the last 25 years to have been mistreated by selectors... But Yallop was the first, and arguably copped the rawest deal, of them all.... Graham Yallop in three words? Unlucky Uncelebrated Unmissed seem to fit best, more's the pity.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Yale's {{buildings}} were {{constructed in the}} Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School. Stone sculpture built into {{the walls of the}} buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them {{in the style of the}} Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, [...] tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.|$|E
