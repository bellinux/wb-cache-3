25|$|A {{traditional}} samovar {{consists of}} a large metal container with a tap near the bottom and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. The pipe is filled with solid fuel which is ignited to heat {{the water in the}} surrounding container. A small (6 to 8inch) smoke-stack is put on the top to ensure draft. After the water boils and the fire is extinguished, the smoke-stack can be removed and a teapot placed on top to be heated by the rising hot air. The teapot is used to brew a strong concentrate of tea known as заварка (zavarka). The tea is served by diluting this concentrate with кипяток (kipyatok) (boiled water) from the <b>main</b> <b>container,</b> usually at a water:tea ratio of 10:1, although tastes vary.|$|E

50|$|There are 3 <b>main</b> <b>containers</b> {{that are}} {{commonly}} used by investigators to package fire debris evidence; mason jars, paint containers, and nylon bags. Studies have been conducted to determine which container is the most suitable {{for use in the}} field. It was found that the glass mason jars had the fastest leak rate while the nylon bags when properly heat sealed had the slowest. The leaks in these containers allow volatile ILRs to escape which will lower the chances of obtaining a positive result from that evidence. Although this is the case all three containers are still used today by various investigators since the losses that do happen are not significant enough to affect the results if the samples are analyzed in a timely manner. In Ontario, Canada the common practice for investigators is to use mason jars to package their evidence and nylon bags for anything which is too large for a mason jar.|$|R

For the purpose of food safety during food transport in micro scale businesses with non-refrigerated trucks, coolers are one of the <b>main</b> <b>containers</b> {{that can be used to}} meet food safety regulations. In this research, a computer model has been developed to calculate the quantity of coolant that can maintain the safe level of temperature required depending on type of food, cooler, and coolant. Also, prototype software and hardware based on the model have been designed for helping to prevent the product from reaching the danger temperature zone so that users can transport food safely along the way. Some sample experiments have been designed and carried out to validate the model. The model shows good agreement with experimental results. Additionally, advantages and disadvantages of each type of coolers and each type of coolants are summarized...|$|R
