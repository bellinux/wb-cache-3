5|$|Exception Syllables with {{an initial}} sonorant (l-/m-/n-/r-) use the basic form for T2 rather than T1. In these syllables the (rarer) T1 is marked with -h- as the second letter. For example mha is T1 (mā), whereas <b>ma</b> <b>is</b> T2 (má). T3 and T4 are regular: maa (mǎ) and mah (mà).|$|E
25|$|Also, {{there exists}} a {{negative}} form for the word Mā (ما النافية). This <b>Mā</b> <b>is</b> a particle used to negate the perfect (past tense) verb. It almost invariably comes before such verbs. This <b>Mā</b> <b>is</b> sometimes followed by an imperfect verb. This has minor rhetorical considerations and is somewhat rare. Therefore, in most cases, one can interchangeably use Lā and Mā to convey negativness.|$|E

25|$|During the Quaternary Period, {{the total}} volume of land ice, sea level, and global {{temperature}} has fluctuated initially on 41,000- and more recently on 100,000-year time scales, as evidenced most clearly by ice cores for the past 800,000 years and marine sediment cores for the earlier period. Over the past 740,000 years there have been eight glacial cycles. The entire Quaternary Period, starting 2.58 <b>Ma,</b> <b>is</b> referred to as an ice age because at least one permanent large ice sheet—the Antarctic ice sheet—has existed continuously. There is uncertainty over how much of Greenland was covered by ice during the previous and earlier interglacials. During the colder episodes—referred to as glacial periods—large ice sheets at least 4km thick at their maximum also existed in Europe, North America, and Siberia. The shorter and warmer intervals between glacials {{are referred to as}} interglacials.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Medical {{students}} completing their clinical years graduands wear the gown and hood of the B.Chir degree. This {{is due to the}} fact the B.Chir degree is conferred in absentia as soon as the list of people passing the Final M.B examination is posted outside Senate House. This was to prevent the necessity for a 'double graduation' ceremony. As such it is common practice for students to hire the B.Chir academic dress, rather than purchase it, for it is superseded by the M.B academic dress post graduation. In {{the case of}} students who have completed both pre-clinical and clinical years at Cambridge, many alumni and graduates do not purchase the M.B academic dress, merely hiring it for any occasions requiring academic dress (Alumni Formal Hall etc.) as this is superseded a mere couple of years later when the automatic Oxbridge <b>MA</b> <b>is</b> granted. Medical students graduate at the end of the third year with a Cambridge BA, and for this ceremony are treated as any other students graduating with a BA.|$|E
