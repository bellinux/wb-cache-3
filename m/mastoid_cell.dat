40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of the patulous {{eustachian tube}} (PET) remains unclear. The degree of <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> pneumatization {{is considered an}} indicator of chronic inflammation {{of the middle ear}}. We used the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> area to investigate the relationship between past chronic inflammation of the middle ear cavity and a PET in 84 patients (20 to 83 years old). The <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> size was calculated from radiographs and analyzed relative to the history of otitis media (OM). The controls were 100 normal ears. The patients ' <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> size was significantly suppressed versus that of the controls, in both 31 PET cases with and 53 PET cases without past OM. We surmise the possibility that the PET ears had experienced inflammation even when the patients had no history of OM and the tympanic membrane showed no OM sequelae. This study indicates the existence of some relationship between a history of chronic inflammation of the middle ear cavity and a PET.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of high resolutioncomputed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) for assessment of factors whichwould influence the type and success of surgery in patientsundergoing cochlear implantation. Materials and methods: All patients underwent HRCTimaging while MRI was performed in 38 of them. MRIand HRCT images were evaluated for <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> pneumatization,sigmoid sinus localization, aberrant vascularstructures, congenital anomalies, cochlear stenosis, labyrinthossification, infection, internal acoustic canal width,presence of vestibulo-cochlear nerve, semicircular canals,cerebellopontin area, and cochlear and vestibularaquaduct width. Results: Totally 49 patients (29 males and 20 femaleswith a mean age of 12. 3 years (1 - 61 years) were included. Various abnormalities or congenital anomalies werefound in 35 patients by HRCT and MRI. We observedgrade 1 <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> pneumatization in 58 ears (59. 3 %),grade 2 in 23 (23. 4 %) and grade 3 in 17. Furthermorethe position of sigmoid sinus (p< 0. 001) and mastoidwidth (p< 0. 001) were affected by <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> ventilation. HRCT provides knowledge about mastoid and middle earventilation, cortical bone thickness, round window niche,perilymphatic-endolymphatic compartment and status ofinternal acoustic canal. Pathologies such as otosclerosisand Paget disease that involve otic capsule can berevealed by CT. MRI can provide views of intracochlearviscosity and cochlear opening, semicircular canals, cerebellopontinarea, and vestibulocochlear nerve. Conclusions: HRCT and MRI provide information aboutthe etiology of hearing loss, suitable side for cochlearimplantation and detection of abnormalities or anatomicvariations that may cause complications introperatively.

40|$|Extended {{subtotal}} petrosectomy as {{a treatment}} for stubborn cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea is presented. Nine patients were successfully operated on by this technique, all previously having undergone surgery for brain or base of skull lesions, other interventions used had failed to seal the fistula. The retrosigmoid cells, facial cells, and internal auditory canal were found in our study to be the most commonly involved during pervious neurosurgery and so constituted the usual path for CSF leakage. Total exenteration of middle ear and <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> tracts, skeletization of sigmoid sinus, jugular bulb and facial nerve, drilling out of the semicircular canals, vestibulum, and cochlea, and skeletization of the internal auditory canal are the main steps of this approach...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to understanding the physiological functions of the mastoid cellsystem. It is suggested that the cell system, in combination with the continuous blood fow through theadjacent large vessels, makes up a compound functional unit that serves to protect the sensitive vestibularpart of the inner ear from inadequate stimulation by external temperature changes. By virtue of the largesurface area of the cell system mucosa with respect to the enclosed gas volume, the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> systemmay also work as a pressure regulator. Variations of the bi-directional exchange of fuid over the capillarynetwork in the mucosa will change the size of the lumen that is available for the gas in the cell system. Volumes of gas and fuid can thus be exchanged to keep the intratympanic pressure within physiologicallimits. The process is most effective in a cell system with a high area-to-volume ratio...|$|E
40|$|The present paper, {{which is}} mainly {{concerned}} with disturbance {{of the ear}} in atrophic rhinitis, {{is based on the}} study of 34 patients with atrophic rhinitis operated on by maxillotarbinal plasty and 41 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, who served as the control. In the present studies, the author has exmined the ear from various angles; clinical study of the ear test by audiometer and X ray examination of the mastoid cells. The incidence of complicating disturbance of the ear among patients with atrophic rhinitis was about 40 %. Otitis media was complicated most frequently. As usual, the ears with disturbance of development of <b>mastoid</b> <b>cell</b> became chronic, if infected, and their hearing was disturbed. Otitis media was frequently found in patients with intranasal mucosal atrophy of high degree, but it was not related to crust formation or upper respiratory diseases. Disturbance of pneumatisation of the ear was found more frequently in the atrophic rhinitis. Parallelism existed to a certain degree between pneumatisation of the middle ear and that of the nasal sinuses, with some exceptions. The incidence of dry cerumen was higher among patients with atrophic rhinitis than among those with rhinosiriusitis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} nasal septal deviation (NSD) and the volume of <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> pneumatization and compare it with the volume of maxillary sinus in a pediatric population. MATERIALS and METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a university-based, secondary referral hospital. Paranasal sinus CT imaging data of 59 children were reconstructed to the 3 -dimensional model, and subsequently, we measured {{the volume of the}} maxillary sinus and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell.</b> On coronal images, nasal septal angle (NSA) and NSD/NC (nasal septal deviation/nasal cavity) ratio were measured. RESULTS: <b>Mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> volume, as well as maxillary sinus volume, of the deviated side was smaller than that of the contralateral side, but these were not statistically significant. There was no correlation between NSA and volumes of <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> and the maxillary sinus. There also was no correlation between NSD/NC ratio and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus volumes. Significant linear and growth regression was found between age and volume of the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus but not between age and NSA and NSD/NC ratio. CONCLUSION: <b>Mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> volume and maxillary sinus volume of the deviated side tended to be smaller than those of the contralateral side, which suggests that NSD can influence both aerations. However, because the degree of NSD did not correlate with the volumes of the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus in this study, we should consider that further possible factors may be involved in both aerations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{paranasal}} sinuses and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> vary considerably {{in size and}} shape from person to person. The main structures are pneumatic. In this study, we investigated the relationship between right and left sides and evaluated the volume changes according to age and sex. METHODS : Of all patients attending the radiology department, 91 cases without {{paranasal sinuses}} and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> pathology (i. e., inflammation, operation or trauma) were selected for evaluation. Axial computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for both paranasal sinuses and temporal bones. In all scans, the volumes of each area (maxillary sinus, frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell)</b> were calculated and analyzed statistically. RESULTS : The volumes of paranasal sinuses and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> increased with age and women had a lower mean volume.

50|$|The antrum {{communicates}} {{behind and}} below with the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells,</b> which vary considerably in number, size, and form; the antrum and <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> are lined by mucous membrane, continuous with that lining the tympanic cavity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Introduction and objective: The <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system {{represents}} {{a more or}} less extensive system of interconnecting air filled cavities arising from the mastoid and walls of middle ear. Based on the density of <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> it has been described as sclerotic (absence of pneumatisation) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these a large irregular cavity is situated at the upper and front part of the bone. It is called the tympanic antrum, and must be distinguished from the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells,</b> though it communicates with them. Like the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells</b> {{it is filled with}} air and lined by a prolongation of the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, with which it communicates. The tympanic antrum is bounded above by a thin plate of bone, the tegmen tympani, which separates it from the middle fossa of the base of the skull; below by the mastoid process; laterally by the squama just below the temporal line, and medially by the lateral semicircular canal of the internal ear which projects into its cavity. It opens in front into that portion of the tympanic cavity which is known as the attic or epitympanic recess. The tympanic antrum is a cavity of some considerable size at the time of birth; the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> may be regarded as diverticula from the antrum, and begin to appear at or before birth; by the fifth year they are well-marked, but their development is not completed until toward puberty.|$|R

40|$|We sought better {{understanding}} about the facial nerve anatomy in the rare inner ear Michel anomaly to help better define this aplasia and prevent potential complications in surgery on these patients. The data from computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance images of six Michel aplastic ears (three patients) were evaluated for a facial nerve course. Facial nerve course and anatomic landmarks were noted. Based on data obtained from this group of very rare patients, three different facial nerve anatomies were encountered. The first patient had normal-looking <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells,</b> normal middle ear ossicles, and a completely formed facial nerve canal through the middle ear. The second patient had pneumatized <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> despite an anomalous ossicular chain. This patient also had a facial nerve canal but not through the middle ear. In the third patient, although <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells</b> were present, neither ossicles nor a definite facial nerve canal could be detected. With guidance provided by the anatomy of {{the other parts of}} the ear, such as air cells and the ossicular chain, the danger zones posing a high probability of facial nerve injury can be predicted. Although all Michel aplasias may have aplastic petrous bone in common, there are some degrees of variation...|$|R
50|$|This recess is a {{possible}} route of spread of infection to the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> located in the mastoid process {{of the temporal bone}} of the skull.

50|$|The mastoid antrum (tympanic antrum, antrum mastoideum, Valsalva's antrum) is an {{air space}} in the petrous portion of the {{temporal}} bone, communicating posteriorly with the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells</b> and anteriorly with the epitympanic recess {{of the middle ear}} via the aditus to mastoid antrum (entrance to the mastoid antrum).

40|$|The mastoid, {{located in}} the {{temporal}} bone, houses an air cell system whose cells have a variation in size that can go far below current conventional clinical CT scanner resolution. Therefore, the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system is only partially represented in a CT scan. Where the conventional clinical CT scanner lacks level of minute details, micro-CT scanning provides an overwhelming amount of ne details. The temporal bone {{being one of the}} most complex in the human body, visualization of micro-CT scanning of this boneawakens the curiosity of the experimenter, especially with the correct visualization settings. This thesis first presents a statistical analysis determining the surface area to volume ratio of the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system of human temporal bone, from micro-CT scanning using methods previously applied for conventional clinical CT scans. The study compared current results with previous studies, with successive downsampling the data down to a resolution found in conventional clinical CT scanning. The results from the statistical analysis showed that all the small <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells,</b> that cannot be detected in conventional clinical CT scans, do heavily contribute to the estimation of the surface area, and in consequence to the estimation of the surface area to volume ratio by a factor of about 2. 6. Such a result further strengthens the idea of the mastoid to play an active role in pressure regulation and gas exchange. Discovery of micro-channels through specific use of a non-traditional transfer function was then reported, where a qualitative and a quantitative pre-analysis were performed and reported. To gain more knowledge about these micro-channels, a local structure tensor analysis was applied where structures are described in terms of planar, tubular, or isotropic structures. The results from this structural tensor analysis suggest these microchannels to potentially be part of a more complex framework, which hypothetically would provide a separate blood supply for the mucosa lining the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system. The knowledge gained from analysing the micro-channels as locally providing blood to the mucosa, led to the consideration of how inflammation of the mucosa could impact the pneumatization of the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system. Though very primitive, a 3 D shape analysis of the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system was carried out. The <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system was first represented in a compact form through a medial axis, from which medial balls could be used. The medial balls, representative of how large the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> can be locally, were used in two complementary clustering methods, one based on the size diameter of the medial balls and one based on their location within the <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cell</b> system. From both quantitative and qualitative statistics, it was possible to map the clusters based on pre-defined regions already described in the literature, which opened the door for new hypotheses concerning the effect of mucosal inflammation on the mastoid pneumatization. Last but not least, discovery of other structures, previously unreported in the literature, were also visually observed and briefly discussed in this thesis. Further analysis of these unknown structures is needed...|$|R

5000|$|Schuller's view is {{a lateral}} {{radiographic}} view of skull principally used for viewing <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells.</b> The central beam of X-rays passes {{from one side}} of the head and is at angle of 25° caudad to radiographic plate. This angulation prevents overlap of images of two mastoid bones. Radiograph for each mastoid is taken separately. The Schullers view serves as an alternative view to the Law projection which uses a 15 degree angle of patient's face toward the image receptor and a 15 degree caudal angulation of the CR to achieve the same result, a lateral <b>mastoid</b> air <b>cells</b> view without overlap of the opposite side.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe an endoscopic open "centrifugal" technique used to treat middle ear cholesteatoma with antral and periantral extension, using a retrospective chart and video review of a case series performed in a university tertiary referral center. Charts and videos of patients who underwent middle ear endoscopic surgery from January 2007 to September 2009 were reviewed. Patients who were treated with endoscopic "centrifuge" open techniques were included in the study. Surgical indications were collected and the surgical technique described. The final study group consisted of 12 / 150 subjects (9 males and 3 females with a mean age of 40 years). All 12 patients who underwent endoscopic open tympanoplasty had antral, periantral or mastoid involvement of cholesteatoma with or without posterior canal wall erosion. They had sclerotic mastoids with the presence of the antrum and, in some cases, small periantral <b>mastoid</b> <b>cells.</b> In 9 / 12 patients, external auditory canal reconstruction was performed with a cartilage graft. In 3 / 12 patients, canal reconstruction was not performed. No subjects required a meatoplasty of the external auditory canal.
