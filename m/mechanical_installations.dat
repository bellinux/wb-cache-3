This article identifies spatial quality determinants that are affected by renovation in residential buildings.

While <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> are often needed during competitions in order to guarantee constant conditions, relaying on <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> during the daily and recreational use of the venues challenges their medium/long term sustainability. Computational form finding approaches can favour the achievement of high-performing and sustainable sport buildings. In this light, the paper tackles the use of Multi-objective and Multidisciplinary design optimization. The paper presents the concept of Multi-objective Multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to support trade-off decisions between multiple conflicting design objectives and interdisciplinary design methodology, during the conceptual design of sport buildings. The proposed method is based on parametric modelling, performance simulation tools and algorithms for computational optimization, for which the paper tackles three specific aspects. First of all, due to the complexity of large sport buildings, the formulation of the optimization and the screening of the related design variables is crucial in order to obtain a meaningful design space, which helps reducing unnecessary computational burden. Secondly, assessing performance based on measurements and analyses is crucial and can be supported by performance simulations tools; however effectively integrating performance simulations tools in the early phase of the design requires new tools. In this light, a customized computational process for the rapid assessment of temperature and airflow patterns is presented. Thirdly, the process requires the combination of design optimization and design exploration, while searching for well-performing solutions.

Oil spills are an inevitable consequence of the need to produce store and transport oil. The commercialization of oil production has placed Ghana among High-Risk Zones which are characterised by high traffic density and the presence of navigational hazards. Despite Ghanas awareness about oil spill accidents in both preparedness and response it is likely it will be compromised when any accident occurs as it has more pressing demands on finite funds and resources. This situation might place Ghana among ill-prepared countries against oil spill combat. An important part of contingency plan is the prediction of locations that are susceptible to oil after spillage. This can be done by the use of satellite information reviewing and comparing previous incidents laboratory work or by fine tuning models which as of now the country is not having despite all the precautions to prevent oil spills. When spill models are used properly they provide ecological economic and social benefits. Hence the need for such decision-making tool for Ghana to create an environment for the contingency plans to be tested validated and upgraded. Such exercises not only maintain and increase the skills of the response personnel but also lead to improvements and fine tuning of the plan as weaknesses and gaps are identified...|$|E

40|$|Delay is {{a common}} problem in the {{construction}} industry and there are several reasons that can contribute to delaying a project. In Hong Kong, completion of fire services installation is prerequisite to completing/ finishing a building construction work. The fire services installation must be completed for application of an occupation permit for a building. Fail to obtain the permit on time would lead to construction delay. Apparently, fire services contractors {{play an important role in}} obtaining the occupation permit for a project completion. The economic losses due to construction delay could be very significant. This research identified, from a list of 49 pre-determined factors in nine categories (shown in Appendix A), the principal factors contributed to construction delays in a fire services installation. In particular, a questionnaire survey of 52 fire services contractors and 32 consulting engineers was conducted in order to obtain their professional judgements about the relative importance of the contributors of construction delay related to the fire services installation. The result showed that the principal contributors were: (1) improper site co-ordination and management of the electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations,</b> (2) lack of timely decision making of the client, and (3) defects identified during the fire services inspection by local authorities. In addition differing views were found between the consulting engineers and contractors on the areas identified were: (1) site management and supervision, (2) workload of the project staff, (3) the procedures for equipment approval, and (4) working experience of the parties. A monitoring and quality assurance system would be required in these areas to minimize the risk of the probable construction delay. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Botswana {{has in the}} recent years come under severe pressure due to increased competition and a critical shortage of construction work. The competition has been {{as a result of a}} dramatic influx of foreign firms that have set up base in Botswana in recent years due to Botswana’s good economic performance. The abundant diamond resources coupled with the government’s sound macroeconomic policies have largely driven this economic growth. As a result of the shortage of construction work, locally owned emerging construction companies have had to change their bidding strategies in order to be competitive and secure construction work. This in turn has led these companies tendering at very low prices and sometimes submitting sub-economic bids. In doing so, these construction companies do not price for all the risks they are expected to carry if their bids mature into a construction contract. This paper investigates the sources of risk due to the client (Botswana local authorities) and due to statutory requirements and whether these sources are perceived by the emerging building contractors to have an influence in their (contractors) pricing strategies. The paper also investigates the risk management strategies, which are employed by these contractors in order to minimize risks during competitive tendering. The study concentrated on those building projects tendered in the public sector within the local authorities in Botswana. This was further narrowed down to specifically those projects tendered for the district councils located in the southern region of Botswana. The study concentrated on building projects and excluded civil engineering projects and projects that are overwhelmingly of specialized electrical or <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations.</b> Thesis (M Sc) (Project Management)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. ai 201...|$|E
40|$|Often {{described}} as frozen music, architecture {{functions as a}} fixation agent for contemporaneous or past thinking on appropriate space for embarking on or ending a journey. The underlying conceptualization of this space relies on study visits to exemplary models or meticulous studies of drawings of space for mobility. This type of architecture becomes visual to its essence. It interacts with the human capacity of seeing {{in order to be}} perceived correctly. The spatial design describes the progression from the immobile built environment, which surrounds the embarkation space, to the means of transportation: air planes, buses or trains. Orientational cues inside the embarkation space give indication on how to access the infrastructure. This includes colour coding, illumination and signage. Sound insulation as an orientational cues is often neglected, thus, creating a vibrant soundscape of callouts, voices and <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations.</b> In order to help people with reduced sight or visual impairments, tactile cues are integrated in the flooring. These are supposed to facilitate way-finding from various key points in the embarkation space like from the entrance to the check-in counter, or to assisted services.

The study is based on interviews with people with visual problems and their experiences of Swedish architecture for mobility. This group of people often associate tactile cues with ambiguous spatial interpretations. Fixed to the built environment, tactile cues are subject to conflicting interests in maintenance and use of the embarkation space, which may inhibit or promote this user group’s independent use of this type of space.
