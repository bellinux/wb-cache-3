40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{switching}} of the bacterial flagellar motor regulates cell motility in bacterial chemotaxis. It {{has been}} reported under physiological conditions that the switching bias of the flagellar motor undergoes large temporal fluctuations, which reflects noise propagating in the chemotactic signaling network. On the other hand, nongenetic heterogeneity is also observed in flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching,</b> as {{a large group of}} <b>switching</b> <b>motors</b> show different <b>switching</b> bias and frequency under the same physiological condition. In this work, we present simultaneous measurement of groups of Escherichia coli flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> and compare them to long time recording of single <b>switching</b> <b>motors.</b> Consistent with previous studies, we observed temporal fluctuations in switching bias in long time recording experiments. However, the variability in switching bias at the populational level showed much higher volatility than its temporal fluctuation. These results suggested stable individuality in E.  coli <b>motor</b> <b>switching.</b> We speculate that uneven expression of key regulatory proteins with amplification by the ultrasensitive response of the motor can account for the observed populational heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations...|$|R
50|$|A {{contactor}} is an electrically controlled switch {{used for}} switching an electrical power circuit, {{similar to a}} relay except with higher current ratings {{and a few other}} differences.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> is {{a protein}} complex. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium it regulates {{the direction of}} flagellar rotation and hence controls swimming behaviour. The switch is a complex apparatus that responds to signals transduced by the chemotaxis sensory signalling system during chemotactic behaviour. CheY, the chemotaxis response regulator, is believed to act directly on the switch to induce tumbles in the swimming pattern, but no physical interactions of CheY and switch proteins have yet been demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotational}} {{direction of}} E. coli {{is controlled by}} the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch.</b> A ring of 34 FliM proteins around the rotor bind CheY, whose phosphorylation state determines whether the motor rotates in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner. The rapid switching mechanism is attributed to an ultrasensitive response, which has a Hill coefficient of ~10. This system has been proposed to follow a dissipative allosteric model, in which rotational switching is a result of both CheY binding and energy consumption from the proton motive force, which also powers the flagellar rotation.|$|E
40|$|A {{hallmark}} of aging is the sensorimotor deficit, {{characterized by an}} increased reaction time and a reduction of motor abilities. Some mechanisms such as motor inhibition deteriorate with aging because of neuronal density alterations and modifications of connections between brain regions. These deficits may be compensated throughout a recruitment of additional areas. Studies have shown that old adults have increased difficulty in performing bimanual coordination tasks compared with young adults. In contrast, <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> is poorly documented {{and is expected to}} engage increasing resources in the elderly.

40|$|By reverse-engineering we have {{detected}} eight kinetic {{phases of the}} symmetric switch cycle of the Halobacterium salinarum flagellar motor assembly and identified those steps in the switch cycle that are controlled by sensory rhodopsins during phototaxis. Upon switching the rotational sense, the flagellar motor assembly passes through a stop state from which all subunits synchronously resume rotation in the reverse direction. The assembly then synchronously proceeds through three subsequent functional states of the switch: Refractory, Competent, and Active, from which the rotational sense is switched again. Sensory control of the symmetric switch cycle occurs at two steps in each rotational sense by inversely regulating the probabilities for a change from the Refractory to the Competent and from Competent to the Active rotational mode. We provide a mathematical model for flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> and its sensory control, which is able to explain all tested experimental results on spontaneous and light-controlled <b>motor</b> <b>switching,</b> and give a mechanistic explanation based on synchronous conformational transitions of the subunits of the switch complex after reversible dissociation and binding of a response regulator (CheYP). We conclude that the kinetic mechanism of flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> and its sensory control is fundamentally different in the archaeon H. salinarum and the bacterium Escherichia coli...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{bacterium}} Vibrio alginolyticus uses {{a single}} polar flagellum to navigate {{in an aqueous}} environment. Similar to Escherichia coli cells, the polar flagellar motor has two states; when the motor is counter-clockwise, the cell swims forward and when the motor is clockwise, the cell swims backward. V. alginolyticus also incorporates a direction randomization step {{at the start of}} the forward swimming interval by flicking its flagellum. To gain an understanding on how the polar flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> is regulated, distributions of the forward Δ_f and backward Δ_b intervals are investigated herein. We found that the steady-state probability density functions, P(Δ_f) and P(Δ_b), of freely swimming bacteria are strongly peaked at a finite time, suggesting that the <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> is not Poissonian. The short-time inhibition is sufficiently strong and long lasting, i. e., several hundred milliseconds for both intervals, which is readily observed and characterized.

40|$|Prokaryotic taxis, {{the active}} search of motile cells {{for the best}} {{environmental}} conditions, {{is one of the}} paradigms for signal transduction. The search algorithm implemented by the cellular biochemistry modulates the probability of switching the rotational direction of the flagellar motor, a nanomachine that propels prokaryotic cells. On the basis of the well-known biochemical mechanisms of chemotaxis in Escherichia coli, kinetic modeling of the events leading from chemoreceptor activation by ligand binding to the motility response has been performed with great success. In contrast to Escherichia coli, Halobacterium salinarum, in addition, responds to visible light, which is sensed through specific photoreceptors of different wavelength sensitivity (phototaxis). Light stimuli of defined intensity and time course can be controlled precisely, which facilitates input-output measurements used for system analysis of the molecular network connecting the sensory receptors to the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch.</b> Here, we analyze the response of halobacterial cells to single and double-pulse light stimuli and present the first kinetic model for prokaryotic cells that couples the signal-transduction pathway with the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch.</b> Modeling based on experimental data supports the current biochemical model of halobacterial phototaxis. Moreover, the simulations demonstrate that motor switching occurs through subsequent rate-limiting steps, which are both under sensory control, suggesting that two signals may be involved in halobacterial phototaxis...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{chemotaxis}} {{is based}} on modulation of the probability to switch the direction of flagellar rotation. Responses to many stimuli are transduced by a two-component system via reversible phosphorylation of CheY, a small cytoplasmic protein that directly interacts with the switch complex at the flagellar motor. We found that the chemorepellents indole and benzoate induce <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> in Escherichia coli cells with a disabled phosphorylation cascade. This phosphorylation-independent chemoresponse is explained by reversible inhibition of fumarase by indole or benzoate which leads to an increased level of cellular fumarate, a compound involved in <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> for bacteria and archaea. Genetic deletion of fumarase increased the intracellular concentration of fumarate and enhanced the switching frequency of the flagellar motors irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of the phosphorylation cascade. These correlations provide evidence for fumarate-dependent metabolic signal transduction in bacterial chemosensing...|$|R

40|$|The Escherichia coli flagellar motor senses the {{intracellular}} {{concentration of}} the response regulator CheY-P and responds by varying the bias between its counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotational states. The response is ultrasensitive with a large Hill coefficient (≈ 10). Recently, the detailed distribution functions of the CW and the CCW dwell times have been measured for different CW biases. Based on a general result on {{the properties of the}} dwell-time statistics for all equilibrium models, we show that the observed dwell-time statistics imply that the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> operates out of equilibrium, with energy dissipation. We propose a dissipative allosteric model that generates dwell-time statistics consistent with the experimental results. Our model reveals a general nonequilibrium mechanism for ultrasensitivity wherein the switch operates with a small energy expenditure to create high sensitivity. In contrast to the conventional equilibrium models, this mechanism does not require one to assume that CheY-P binds to the CCW and CW states with different affinities. The estimated energy consumption by the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> suggests that the transmembrane proton motive force, which drives the motor's rotation, may also power its switching. The existence of net transitional fluxes between microscopic states of the switch is predicted, measurement of these fluxes can test the nonequilibrium model directly. Both the results on the general properties of the dwell-time statistics and the mechanism for ultrasensitivity should be useful for understanding a diverse class of physical and biological systems...|$|E

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum, {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{economically important plant}} pathogen, invades the roots of diverse plant hosts from the soil and aggressively colonizes the xylem vessels, causing a lethal wilting known as bacterial wilt disease. By examining bacteria from the xylem vessels of infected plants, we found that R. solanacearum is essentially nonmotile in planta, although it can be highly motile in culture. To determine the role of pathogen motility in this disease, we cloned, characterized, and mutated two genes in the R. solanacearum flagellar biosynthetic pathway. The genes for flagellin, the subunit of the flagellar filament (fliC), and for the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> protein (fliM) were isolated based on their resemblance to these proteins in other bacteria. As is typical for flagellins, the predicted FliC protein had well-conserved N- and C-terminal regions, separated by a divergent central domain. The predicted R. solanacearum FliM closely resembled <b>motor</b> <b>switch</b> proteins from other proteobacteria. Chromosomal mutants lacking fliC or fliM were created by replacing the genes with marked interrupted constructs. Since fliM {{is embedded in the}} fliLMNOPQR operon, the aphA cassette was used to make a nonpolar fliM mutation. Both mutants were completely nonmotile on soft agar plates, in minimal broth, and in tomato plants. The fliC mutant lacked flagella altogether; moreover, sheared-cell protein preparations from the fliC mutant lacked a 30 -kDa band corresponding to flagellin. The fliM mutant was usually aflagellate, but about 10 % of cells had abnormal truncated flagella. In a biologically representative soil-soak inoculation virulence assay, both nonmotile mutants were significantly reduced in the ability to cause disease on tomato plants. However, the fliC mutant had wild-type virulence when it was inoculated directly onto cut tomato petioles, an inoculation method that did not require bacteria to enter the intact host from the soil. These results suggest that swimming motility makes its most important contribution to bacterial wilt virulence {{in the early stages of}} host plant invasion and colonization...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} designed to study behavior in populations of Spirochaeta aurantia cells, and this program has been used to analyze changes in behavior in response to chemoattractants. Three kinds of behavior were distinguished: smooth swimming, flexing, and reversals in direction of swimming after a short pause (120 ms). Cell populations exposed to chemoattractants spent, on average, 66, 33, and 1 % of the time in these modes, respectively. After the addition of a chemoattractant, behavior was modified transiently [...] smooth swimming increased, flexing decreased, and reversals were suppressed. After addition of D-xylose (final concentration, 10 mM), the adaptation time (the time required for the populations to return to the unmodified behavior) for S. aurantia was 1. 5 to 2. 0 min. A model to explain the behavior of S. aurantia and the response of cells to chemoattractants is described.
