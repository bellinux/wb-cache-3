500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{were not}} as kind, however. A review of Brando's {{performance}} in the opening assessed that Brando was [...] "still building his character, but at present fails to impress." [...] One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, [...] "Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space." [...] He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. [...] "There were a few times when he was really magnificent," [...] Bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962. [...] "He was a great young actor {{when he wanted to}} be, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even hear him on the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Powerfully built, Marsh was {{regarded}} as an all rounder {{for the majority of}} his career. Coupled with his short stature, his power suited him to the task of keeping wicket. [...] Despite his bulk, which forced him to work heavily on reducing his weight in his early career, he had fast feet movement, combined with fast anticipation and reflexes which allowed him to cover more ground. He raised the role of wicketkeeper to a more prominent status in a team with his acrobatic diving, raucous appeals and habit of throwing a ball high into the air upon completing a dismissal. [...] As the wicketkeeper, he made himself the focal point in the field and attempted to extract higher standards of concentration from both himself and his team-mates. Speaking of his understanding with Lillee, he said [...] "I've played with him so much now that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> know what he is going to do before he has bowled" [...] Marsh said, [...] "I know from the way he runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be." ...|$|E

60|$|From the Louvre I went to took at the {{principal}} scene of action. A collection {{of some of}} the unclaimed dead was in the Morgue, and every one was allowed to enter. There were fifty or sixty bodies in this place, and among them were a few women and children, who had probably been killed by accident. Nearly all had fallen by gun-shot wounds, principally musket-balls; but a few had been killed by grape. As the disaffected had fought under cover <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> fancy the cavalry did little in this affair. It was whispered that agents of the police were present to watch the countenances and actions of the spectators, with a view to detect the disaffected.|$|E

They fired {{different}} sorts of shells; stink shells as well as Jack Johnsons, and though we didn't get much of that at our corner there was a sting of chlorine in the air all through the afternoon. Most of the stink shells fell short. We hadn't masks, but we rigged up a sort of protection with our handkerchiefs. And it didn't amount to very much. It was rather like the chemistry room after Heinrich and the kids had been mixing things. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was busy helping with {{the men who had}} got hurt.

60|$|WELL, {{pretty soon}} {{the old man}} was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not {{stopping}} school.

That law trial was a slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited--this kind of thing was right in his line.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{some reason}} I never {{was able to}} tell him all this--as I am telling you. The words would not come. We had grown apart.

I had Langmaid talk to him, and other men I trusted--tell him what an unparalleled {{opportunity}} {{he had to be}} of use in the world. Once I thought I had him started straight and then a woman came along--off the streets, or little better. He insisted on marrying her and wrecking his life, and when I got her out of the way, as any father would have done, he left me. He has never forgiven me. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> haven't even the satisfaction of knowing were he is--London, Paris, or New York. I try not to think of what he does. I ought to cut him off,--I can't do it--I can't do it, Hodder--he's my one weakness still. I'm afraid--he'd sink out of sight entirely, and it's the one hold I have left on him." ...|$|E

60|$|I walked {{about the}} chamber <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> {{imagined}} myself {{only to be}} regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up {{and found that the}} afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.|$|E
60|$|February 11th.--I {{have been}} {{measuring}} coal all day, on board {{of a black}} little British schooner, in a dismal dock {{at the north end}} of the city. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> paced the deck to keep myself warm; for the wind (northeast, I believe) blew up through the dock, as if it had been the pipe of a pair of bellows.

Across the water, however, not more than half a mile off, appeared the Bunker Hill Monument; and what interested me considerably more, a church-steeple, with the dial of a clock upon it, whereby I was enabled to measure the march of the weary hours. Sometimes I descended into the dirty little cabin of the schooner, and warmed myself by a red-hot stove, among biscuit-barrels, pots and kettles, sea-chests, and innumerable lumber of all sorts,--my olfactories, meanwhile, being greatly refreshed by the odor of a pipe, which the captain, or some one of his crew, was smoking. But at last came the sunset, with delicate clouds, and a purple light upon the islands; and I blessed it, because it was the signal of my release.|$|E
