5|$|A few time-expired E <b>models</b> <b>were</b> {{retired in}} 1967 and 1968, but the bulk (82) were retired between May 1969 and March 1970. Most F <b>models</b> <b>were</b> also retired between 1967 and 1973, but 23 survived as {{trainers}} until late 1978. The fleet of D models served much longer; 80 D <b>models</b> <b>were</b> extensively overhauled under the Pacer Plank program during the mid-1970s. Skinning {{on the lower}} wing and fuselage was replaced, and various structural components were renewed. The fleet of D models stayed largely intact until late 1978, when 37 not already upgraded Ds were retired. The remainder were retired between 1982 and 1983.|$|E

By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight <b>models</b> <b>were</b> mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional <b>models</b> <b>were</b> launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean.
