40|$|The {{characteristics}} of squeezed light generated by both passive (occurring in a cavity external to a laser) and active (occurring within a laser cavity) second-harmonic generation (SHG) are investigated and contrasted. Squeezing {{of both the}} fundamental and the second harmonic is discussed, {{and the issue of}} doubly versus singly resonant behavior is addressed. We examine passive squeezing by explicitly modeling the intrinsically noisy output of the pump laser and coupling it to a passive, multiport, lossy SHG cavity. Low-frequency degradation of the squeezing caused by the laser pump noise is predicted and provides a probable explanation for previous discrepancies between theory and experiment. Active squeezing is quantitatively modeled by a three-level laser model that retains all laser dynamics. Previously disparate predictions are reconciled. For one parameter set two regimes of squeezing are predicted: 50 % squeezing at frequencies lower than the laser relaxation oscillation, and near-perfect squeezing at frequencies above. A particular problem of active squeezing is highlighted: The fast dephasing of the laser coherence introduces considerable excess noise likely to <b>mask</b> <b>squeezing</b> in experimental situations. We conclude that, although passive SHG is a practical source of squeezing, active SHG is unlikely to be so in the foreseeable future. (C) 1996 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Triply {{resonant}} optical parametric oscillations (TRO) are {{of interest}} for generating stable and highly correlated twin beams. Here we report intensity noise correlation and single beam spectra for pump powers up to 14 times the threshold value. The correlation spectrum appear to be independent of the pump power while the single beams exhibit a peak due to relaxation oscillation. Such a resonance contributes to <b>mask</b> the <b>squeezing</b> predicted for double resonant devices. The herein discussed TRO has shown a temporal stability of the pump resonance longer than 6 h while delivering up to 4 mW per beam, fluctuating less than 5 % over periods longer than half an hour.
