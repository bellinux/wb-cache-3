Workers had to take special care {{because of the high}} voltages used. Power was connected by closing simple knife switches and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit [...] "opened") by a worker garbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs). One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location.

5000|$|Anzani {{was aware}} of the weight cost of the {{counterweight}} in the fan configuration and by December 1909 he had a symmetric 120° three-cylinder radial engine running. One example was a 3.1 litre (186 cu in) unit producing 22 kW (30 hp) at 1,300 rpm. [...] Although termed the Y engine after its symmetric cylinder arrangement, it ran in an inverted Y position so that the <b>plugs,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper in-plane side of the two lower cylinders were less than 30° below the horizontal and less prone to oiling than one serving a piston at 180° from upright. Radials are smoother running than the less symmetric fan engines as well as lower weight but with the low power available from their three cylinders they had limited applications. They led, however, to Anzani's two-row radial engines, beginning with the 6-cylinder radials, two Ys on a common crankshaft. In the 21st century a restored Bleriot XI bearing the French Blériot factory serial number 56 — said to be the oldest flyable aircraft in the Western Hemisphere, bearing the American registration N60094 — is still flown in the United States on summer and early autumn weekends with one of these 120° cylinder angle [...] "Y-type" [...] radial engines.|$|R
40|$|The charge {{structure}} of the surface of articular cartilage determines its interactions with the macromolecules and cells of synovial fluid. It may thereby be important to the physiological function and pathological degeneration of the tissue. To determine whether the electrokinetic properties of the surface {{differ from those of}} the bulk tissue, we measured the streaming potential generated by the flow of electrolyte over the surface of a cartilage <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> in a chamber built for that purpose. We then calculated the effective surface charge density. In nonfibrillated cartilage from the human femoral head, the surface charge density, 0. 037 +/- 0. 004 Cm(- 2) (mean+/-SD), was approximately half that measured at the surface of slices cut from the middle and deep zones. In addition, the surface charge density fell relatively little at low pH; this is consistent with a higher proportion of strongly acidic groups. The variations in surface charge density were found to be similar to those in total fixed charge density in the slices by the tracer cation method. Therefore, no evidence exists that the actual surface differs in composition from the immediately underlying matrix. The addition of synovial fluid (0. 0025 ml/ml) to the superfusing solution reduced the surface charge density by 25 +/- 9 % (n= 5), and we attributed this to the binding of synovial-fluid macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|A {{hot cell}} {{installation}} for {{the handling of}} highly radioactive material may comprise {{a dozen or more}} interconnected high density concrete vaults, the concrete vault walls having a thickness of approximately three feet. Typically, hot cells are constructed in rows so as to share as many shielding walls as possible. A typical overall length of a row of cells might be 70 yards. A secondary mechanism exists for placing certain objects into a cell. A typical hot cell has been constructed with 8 inch diameter holes through the exterior shielded walls in the vicinity of, and usually above, the viewing windows. It became evident that if the hot cell plugs could be removed and replaced conveniently significant savings in time and personnel exposure could be realized by using these 8 inch holes as entry ports. Fifteen inch cylindrical steel plugs with a diameter of eight inches weigh about two hundred pounds. The shield plug swing mechanism comprises a steel shielding <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> on a retraction device that enables the plug to be pulled out of the wall and supports the weight of the pulled out plug. The retraction device is mounted on a hinge, which allows the plug to be swung out of the way so that an operator can insert material into or remove it from the interior of the hot cell and then replace the plug quickly. The hinge mounting transmits the load of the retracted plug to the concrete wall...|$|R

The target was a Ge target <b>mounted</b> Si <b>plug,</b> {{by which a}} film composition of Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 was obtained. By changing the thickness of thin film and the dimension of substrate, we found relationship between film size and thermoelectric properties, forming a basis of device miniaturization. Simultaneously, Si thin films were made with the same parameters in order to compare those with Si 1 -xGex thin film. Finally, we attached Pt coated ACC on all the thin films and measured their hydrogen sensing ability by an in-house system with 1 % and 0. 1 % hydrogen air flow. When a thickness of 344 nm for the Si 1 -xGex thin film is, it has the carrier concentration of 5 × 1016 cm- 3, the carrier mobility of 0. 76 cm 2 /Vs, the conductivity of 7. 7 × 10 - 3 /Ωm, the best Seebeck coefficient of ﹣ 0. 78 mV/K and the best power factor of 4. 7 × 10 - 3 W/K 2 m. Meanwhile, it was also found that with the decrease of the substrate dimension, the properties change rarely. This is beneficial for the miniaturization of device in the future. In the hydrogen sensing ability of all the thin films, we also found {{the thickness of the}} Si 1 -xGex thin film which has the best hydrogen sensing ability is 344 nm. When two Si 1 -xGex thin films which have different thickness have the same absolute value of Seebeck coefficient, the higher the power factor a film has, the better hydrogen sensing ability it possesses. Finally, when two different kind of thin films which have the close Seebeck coefficient, the higher the power factor a film has, the better hydrogen sensing ability it possesses. 本研究利用成分比為Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 之鑲埋靶，以改變薄膜厚度與基材尺寸大小作為實驗參數，經由射頻磁控濺鍍法在石英玻璃基材上沉積Si 1 -xGex薄膜，探討其材料性質、電性和熱電特性，進而了解最佳電性與熱電特性之厚度與尺寸為何，以作為日後製備元件微型化之基礎。同時利用相同實驗參數製備Si薄膜，目的是為了與Si 1 -xGex薄膜比較。最後將鍍有Pt之碳纖維布作為催化層並貼附於所有薄膜上，利用自組裝氫感測量測系統，通以 1 %與 0. 1 %之氫氣，量測其氫氣感測能力，並取Si 1 -xGex薄膜與Si薄膜之熱電特性最佳者來進行氫氣感測能力比較。 由實驗結果顯示，當Si 1 -xGex薄膜厚度為 344 nm時，載子濃度為 5 × 1016 cm- 3 、載子遷移率為 0. 76 cm 2 /Vs、電導率為 7. 7 × 10 - 3 /Ωm，具有最大Seebeck 係數與功率因子，分別為﹣ 0. 78 mV/K和 4. 7 × 10 - 3 W/K 2 m；並且發現隨著基材尺寸縮小，其電性與熱電特性無太大變化，因此有利於未來微型化之發展。 在氫感測能力方面，當Si 1 -xGex薄膜厚度為 344 nm時，不僅具有最大Seebeck 係數與功率因子，其氫感測能力也為最佳，而發現當Seebeck 係數之絕對值為一定值時，功率因子大者，其氫感測能力會較佳。比較熱電特性最佳且數值接近之Si 1 -xGex薄膜與Si薄膜的氫感測能力，發現當Seebeck 係數接近時，功率因子較大者，其氫感測能力表現也會較好。摘要	I Abstract	III 總目次	V 圖目次	IX 表目次	XIV 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 2 第二章 理論基礎與文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 熱電特性簡介	 4 2. 2 Si薄膜材料	 6 2. 3 Si 1 -xGex薄膜材料	 8 2. 4 薄膜製備方式	 10 2. 4. 1 化學氣相沉積法(chemical vapor deposition, CVD) 	 10 2. 4. 2 物理氣相沉積法(physical vapor deposition, PVD) 	 12 2. 4. 3 製程方式選擇	 13 2. 5 薄膜沉積理論	 15 2. 5. 1 薄膜成長機制	 15 2. 5. 2 薄膜微觀結構	 16 2. 6 靶材製備方式	 19 2. 7 氫氣感測器介紹	 20 第三章 實驗方法	 25 3. 1 實驗流程	 25 3. 2 實驗材料	 27 3. 2. 1 基材	 27 3. 2. 2 靶材	 27 3. 2. 3 製程氣體	 27 3. 3 實驗製程	 27 3. 3. 1 基材清洗	 27 3. 3. 2 靶材清洗	 28 3. 3. 3 薄膜製備	 28 3. 4 性質分析與量測	 32 3. 4. 1 厚度測定	 32 3. 4. 2 結晶性分析	 32 3. 4. 3 成分分析	 33 3. 4. 4 表面粗糙度分析	 34 3. 4. 5 光學性質分析	 34 3. 4. 6 電性分析	 35 3. 4. 7 熱電特性分析	 36 3. 5 氫氣感測能力分析	 37 3. 5. 1 樣本製備	 37 3. 5. 2 量測系統	 38 3. 5. 2 量測方法	 38 第四章 結果與討論	 41 4. 1 改變薄膜厚度對Si 1 -xGex薄膜與Si薄膜特性之影響	 41 4. 1. 1 薄膜厚度與沉積速率之探討	 41 4. 1. 2 電性之探討	 46 4. 1. 3 熱電特性之探討	 52 4. 1. 4 結晶結構之探討	 56 4. 1. 5 表面粗糙度之探討	 58 4. 1. 6 薄膜成分之探討	 64 4. 1. 7 光學性質之探討	 79 4. 2 改變基材尺寸對Si 1 -xGex薄膜與Si薄膜特性之影響	 82 4. 2. 1 表面粗糙度之探討	 82 4. 2. 2 電性之探討	 86 4. 2. 3 熱電特性之探討	 90 4. 3 氫氣感測能力分析結果	 93 第五章 結論	 101 第六章 參考文獻	 10...|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stage of balloon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire cable cutters were {{often used in}} place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is wrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome reduces {{the strength of the}} cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a release mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made heated nichrome wire for cutters is not very reliable. Often, the wrapped nichrome wire does not cut through the cable because it either pulls away from its power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because nichrome is not readily soldered to copper wire, unreliable mechanical crimps are often made to connect the nichrome to an electric circuit. A self-contained device that is reusable and reliable was developed to sever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to prevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the nichrome wire using a screw terminal connection. A bayonet plug, a quick and secure method of connecting the cutter to the power source, is used to connect the cutter to the power leads similar to those used in pyro-cutter devices. A small ceramic tube [0. 25 -in. wide 0. 5 -in. long (. 6. 4 -mm wide 13 -mm long) ] houses a spiraled nichrome wire that is heated when a cable release action is required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel. It is then laid inside the ceramic tube so that it fits closely to the inner surface of the tube. The ceramic tube provides some thermal and electrical insulation so that most of the heat generated by the wire is directed toward the cable bundle {{in the center of the}} spiral. The ceramic tube is cemented into an aluminum block, which holds it in position. The leads of the nichrome wire are attached to screw terminals that connect them to power leads. A bayonet <b>plug</b> <b>mounted</b> at the bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A thin aluminum shell encloses the entire structure, leaving access points to attach to the bayonet plug and to feed a cable into the cylinder. The access holes for the deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent the cable from coming in direct contact with the nichrome when loaded. It uses the same general method of severing a cable with a heated wire as was used previously, but implements it in such a way that it is more reliable and less prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was nonexistent in the previous method...|$|R
40|$|The thesis reports {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of premixed combustion rates at high pressure and temperature. It focuses on measurements of laminar and turbulent burning velocities at high pressures and temperatures approaching those in engines, {{with emphasis on}} flame instabilities. To encourage the development of such instabilities, mixtures with negative Markstein numbers were employed. Three different methods were used to measure burning velocities in a spherical bomb. The bomb was fitted with windows for observing flame propagation at {{the centre of the}} bomb and a transducer to measure pressure. Four fans at the wall of the bomb were employed for mixing and the generation of turbulence. The first two methods of measuring burning velocities were well established and involved central ignition. The third method was new and involved implosions of two flame kernels that originated at spark <b>plugs</b> <b>mounted</b> near the wall. It enabled the later stages of burning at the high pressures to be observed and burning velocities to be measured. The first method depended on highspeed schlieren photographic measurements of the flame speed, dr / dt, at different radii,r, supplemented by pressure measurements. The second method was employed when the flame front has propagated beyond the boundaries of the window and could no longer be observed. The expression for the burning velocity rested upon the assumption that the flame was spherical and the fractional pressure rise was equal to the fractional mass burned. Two different approaches were employed for the new third method, one was based on geometrical considerations, the other on the fractional pressure rise. A knowledge of the flame area and the appropriate geometrical analysis enabled two expressions to be obtained for the burning velocity. The agreement between the two different approaches for obtaining burning velocities, and the general consistency of the results for both initially laminar and turbulent flames, showed the technique to be accurate and suitable for obtaining burning velocities at high pressure. As a result, burning velocities, initially laminar, were measured for iso-octane - air at equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 6 at initial pressures of 0. 5 and 1. 0 MPa. They were also measured for hydrogen - air mixtures at equivalence ratios of 0. 3 to 0. 5. Modification of the linear theory of flame instability of Bechtold and Matalon enabled the laminar burning velocity to be obtained from the values of unstable burning velocities. Enhancements of the laminar burning velocity of up to six fold were measured. Turbulent burning velocities were measured over a range of rms turbulent velocities ranging from 0. 25 to 3 mls. It was found that these values of burning velocity were higher than those predicted from earlier expressions, derived predominantly from more stable flames close to atmospheric pressure. The possibility that turbulent burning velocities might be enhanced, not only by the effect of flame stretch at negative Markstein numbers, but also by flamelet instabilities was also investigated at high pressures and with mixtures with very low Markstein numbers. Stoichiometric and rich iso-octane-air flames were selected for this study and mixtures were ignited at initial pressures of 0. 5 and 1. 0 MPa. This enabled burning velocities to be measured up to 6 MPa. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
