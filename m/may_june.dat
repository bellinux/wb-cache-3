5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in <b>May,</b> <b>June</b> or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E

25|$|It {{was once}} assumed that oysters were only safe {{to eat in}} months with the letter 'r' in their English and French names.

25|$|Gillenia (syn. Porteranthus) is a genus of {{two species}} of {{perennial}} herbs in the Rosaceae family. Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, Indian-physic, American ipecac. This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America. Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger lower leaves are divided into palmately arranged leaflets. Plants bloom in <b>May,</b> <b>June,</b> or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp {{as if they were}} wilted. The flowers mature into small capsules. These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used in herbal medicine.|$|E

Redfish larvae were found in <b>May</b> and <b>June</b> in an abundance comparable to that in 1971. Capelin larvae were abundant in <b>May</b> and <b>June</b> from Torsvåg to the North Cape area with the highest concentrations in the northernmost part of the area surveyed.

It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck out the side to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for him because he was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century its main {{industry}} was kelp collection and export. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the kelp industry supported a large amount of the population. It was seasonal work, with collection taking place in the months of <b>May,</b> <b>June</b> and July, when it was considered possible to dry it outdoors. The dried kelp would usually then be burnt, and the ash used to produce various products, including fertiliser (mostly soda ash) and iodine. The ruined kiln on the south shore may have been used for this. Between 1817 and 1828, no less than 256 tonnes of kelp were collected in Ulva. Kelpers collected on average, a wage of two shillings a week, and a stone of wheat.|$|E
25|$|Zile's {{weather is}} {{influenced}} by the narrow coast land of the Black Sea Region to the north, bringing humidity, and by the Central Anatolia inland plateau to the south, with its low rainfall and cold winters. Summers are hot and dry, while the winters are snowy and cold. The weather is hot throughout the months of June to September, as the average summer maximum is 28nbsp&°C (83nbsp&°F), and the average minimum is 13nbsp&°C (56nbsp&°F), and is cold throughout the months of December to February as the average winter maximum is 7nbsp&°C (45nbsp&°F), and the average minimum is as low as -3nbsp&°C (27nbsp&°F). Northerly winds are responsible for humid climate from April to June. It is usually rainy during the months of April, <b>May,</b> <b>June,</b> November and December.|$|E

25|$|The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 {{were four}} {{identical}} diesel-electric streamliner train 2-car power sets delivered in <b>May,</b> <b>June,</b> and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine division of General Motors Corporation and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors. One {{was for the}} City of San Francisco, two were for the City of Denver, and one was a spare set intended for both routes. In 1939, M-10004 was split and converted into additional boosters for the other sets, now renumbered CD-05, CD-06, and CD-07, all running on the City of Denver. The M-10001 power car became the other third booster. In this form, the three power sets ran until they were replaced by E8 locomotives in 1953, at which point they were scrapped.|$|E
25|$|In <b>May,</b> <b>June</b> or July, females {{normally}} lay {{a clutch}} of 1 to 11 eggs into a flask-shaped nest excavated {{in a patch of}} sandy or loamy soil. After 70 to 80 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the small hatchlings emerge from the nest in late summer. In the northern parts of its range, the common box turtle may enter hibernation in October or November. They burrow into loose soil, sand, vegetable matter, or mud at the bottom of streams and pools, or they may use a mammal burrow, and will remain in their chosen shelter until the cold winter has passed. The Common box turtle has been known to attain the greatest lifespan of any vertebrate outside of the tortoises. One specimen lived to be at least 138 years of age.|$|E
25|$|After five {{losses and}} then a win to end <b>May,</b> <b>June</b> saw Derbyshire stretch their unbeaten streak to two as Derbyshire drew against Essex.

Two one-day wins followed, over Kent and the touring Bangladeshis, but on 13 June they posted 82 all out against Durham to lose by five wickets. Derbyshire came ever closer to the elusive Championship win, however, as Lancashire eked through by one wicket in the last match {{before the end of the}} spring season.
