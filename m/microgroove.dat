25|$|Beginning in 1939, Dr. Peter Goldmark and {{his staff}} at Columbia Records and at CBS Laboratories {{undertook}} efforts to address problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive, reliable consumer playback system. It took about eight years of study, except when it was suspended because of World War II. Finally, the 12-inch (30cm) Long Play (LP) rpm <b>microgroove</b> record album was introduced by the Columbia Record Company at a New York press conference on June 18, 1948. At the same time, Columbia introduced a vinyl 7-inch rpm <b>microgroove</b> single, calling it ZLP, but it was short-lived and is very rare today, because RCA Victor introduced a 45rpm single a few months later, which became the standard.|$|E

Wax mastering {{was employed to}} produce Decca/London LPs. This created considerable interest in the United States, and served to raise the customer's overall expectations of quality in <b>microgroove</b> records.|$|E
25|$|When the Columbia LP was {{released}} in June 1948, the developers subsequently published technical information about the rpm <b>microgroove</b> long playing record. Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing {{that it was like}} the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or pre-emphasis below 200Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. This was the first such curve based on formulae.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the management of moisture from the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in the gas channel of a separator for PEFC. At the cathode-side, oxygen is transported as reactant gas from gas channel through GDL. When large quantity of moisture is generated during high power generation, moisture blocks transport of oxygen, and the cell voltage drops drastically. Narrow <b>microgrooves</b> with axes at tilt angle to the air flow were arranged inside channel walls. The water from GDL was discharged along <b>microgrooves</b> to facing top of GDL by forces of capillary and air flow shearing. Laser induced fluorescence method was used to measure water velocity in <b>microgrooves.</b> The effect of air velocity in the gas channel on water velocity in <b>microgrooves</b> was investigated. It was shown <b>microgrooves</b> manufactured inside gas channel worked properly. Water velocity in <b>microgrooves</b> increased with increasing air velocity, and moisture could be discharged from GDL by applying <b>microgrooves.</b> Furthermore, effective length of the <b>microgrooves</b> needed to remove water from the GDL surface increased with decreasing inclination angle of <b>microgrooves</b> in the range of 20 °? 45 °. An effective length of approximately 200 mm was attained, which was overall length of experimental apparatus...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a microfluidic device with <b>microgrooved</b> patterns for studying cellular behavior. This microfluidic platform {{consists of a}} top fluidic channel and a bottom <b>microgrooved</b> substrate. To fabricate the <b>microgrooved</b> channels, a top poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold containing the impression of the microfluidic channels was aligned and bonded to a <b>microgrooved</b> substrate. Using this device, mouse fibroblast cells were immobilized and patterned within <b>microgrooved</b> substrates (25, 50, 75, and 100 μm wide). To study apoptosis in a microfluidic device, media containing hydrogen peroxide, Annexin V, and propidium iodide was perfused into the fluidic channel for 2 hours. We found that cells exposed to the oxidative stress became apoptotic. These apoptotic cells were confirmed by Annexin V that bound to phosphatidylserine at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during the apoptosis process. Using this microfluidic device with <b>microgrooved</b> patterns, the apoptosis process was observed in real-time and analyzed by using an inverted microscope containing an incubation chamber (37 °C, 5 % CO 2). Therefore, this microfluidic device incorporated with <b>microgrooved</b> substrates could be useful for studying the cellular behavior and performing high-throughput drug screening...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{excellent}} thermal conductivity and the compatibility to micro electromechanical systems technology, silicon {{is widely used}} in micro heat pipes (MHPs). Copper shows higher heat transfer capability and capillary traction than silicon. Copper pillars modified <b>microgrooves</b> were fabricated on the silicon wafer using electroforming technique in this paper. Water contact angle measurements and thermal behavior tests were employed to the fabricated <b>microgrooves</b> and MHPs. Under the input power of 4 W, how the working fluid flowed in the <b>microgrooves</b> and steam chamber was easily observed by digital camera. The experiments demonstrated the working fluid flowed via copper pillars instead of the silicon <b>microgrooves</b> due to the adhesive force between working fluid and copper pillars were larger than that between working fluid and silicon <b>microgrooves.</b> This work showed copper pillars had a better capillary traction than the silicon <b>microgrooves,</b> and could make the MHP work as a vapor chamber...|$|R
25|$|Both the <b>microgroove</b> LP rpm {{record and}} the 45rpm single records are made from vinyl plastic that is {{flexible}} and unbreakable in normal use, {{even when they are}} sent through the mail with care from one place to another. The vinyl records, however, are easier to scratch or gouge, and much more prone to warping compared to most 78rpm records, which were made of shellac.|$|E
25|$|Small-diameter coil {{technologies}} {{are becoming more}} popular in modern air conditioning and refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin {{that have been the}} standard in the HVAC industry. Small diameter coils can withstand the higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Two small diameter coil {{technologies are}} currently available for air conditioning and refrigeration products: copper <b>microgroove</b> and brazed aluminum microchannel.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{diameter}} coils {{have better}} rates of heat transfer than conventional sized coils {{and they can}} withstand higher pressures required by {{the new generation of}} environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Smaller diameter coils also have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter. <b>MicroGroove</b> uses a grooved inner surface of the tube to increase the surface to volume ratio and increase turbulence to mix the refrigerant and homogenize temperatures across the tube.|$|E
30|$|The value {{showed that}} the 3 points contact angles of copper <b>microgrooves</b> were smaller than those of silicon <b>microgrooves,</b> respectively. The main reason was the {{dimension}} of the micro grooves at these three sections are different, and we wish the condenser section has higher capillary force, that is more hydrophilic, which can help the working fluid traction back to the evaporation section. Since the capillary traction was proportional to the cosine value of the contact angle, copper <b>microgrooves</b> had stronger hydrophilicity and better capillary traction compared with the silicon <b>microgrooves.</b>|$|R

2500|$|RCA {{began selling}} the first all {{electric}} phonograph in 1930. In 1931, RCA Victor introduced 33⅓ revolutions-per-minute (rpm) records, [...] which were [...] a commercial failure {{at the height}} of the Great Depression, partly because the records and playback equipment were expensive, and also because the audio performance was poor; the new format used the same groove size as existing 78rpm records, and it would require the smaller-radius stylus of the later <b>microgroove</b> systems to achieve acceptable slower-speed performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the cap-illary {{performance}} of triangular <b>microgrooves.</b> The influ-ences of several major of parameters on the capillary performance (wetted axial length) of triangular micro-grooves are discussed theoretically. One dimensional, non-linear and contact angle possessed differential and alge-braic equations are both used for the theoretical analyses of triangular <b>microgrooves.</b> In this study, the curvature ra-dius, cross section area, and distribution of pressure and velocity of working fluid in <b>microgrooves</b> are considered. Besides, the mutual effects among inertial force, body force, capillary force, and friction force are also discussed. The significance of contact angle and hydraulic diameter to the prediction of capillary performance for <b>microgrooves</b> are both demonstrated by the proposed algebraic solutions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} approach for applying <b>microgrooved</b> membranes for improved gas–liquid contacting. The study involves {{analysis of the}} performance of the microdevice by quantifying the flux enhancement for different membrane configurations. Two kinds of configurations, continuous and non-continuous grooves, were investigated. The <b>microgrooves</b> provide shear-free gas–liquid interfaces, which result in local slip velocity at the gas–liquid interface. Exploiting this physical phenomenon, it is possible to reduce mass transport limitations in gas–liquid contacting. An experimental study using grooved membranes suggests enhancement in flux up to 20 – 30 %. The flux enhancement at higher liquid flow rates is observed due to a partial shear-free gas–liquid interface. The performance of the membrane devices decreased with wetted <b>microgrooves</b> due to the mass transport limitations. The flow visualization experiments reveal wetting of the <b>microgrooves</b> at higher liquid flow rates. According to the numerical and experimental study, we have shown that <b>microgrooved</b> membranes can be employed to improve gas–liquid contacting processes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in oil film and the load carrying capacities of conical slide micro bearings with grooved sleeves. The results for some bearings examples are presented. For the bearings taken into account, the Reynolds equation was solved by the method of Finite Differences. In the calculations, the Reynolds boundary condition was applied. The simulation was performed for the conical slide micro bearings with the groves parallel to the cone generating line. The function of lubrication gap height for the conical slide bearings with sleeves covered with <b>microgrooves</b> was assumed on the basis of existing papers. The results obtained for the analogous bearings without the <b>microgrooves</b> are also shown, therefore the influence of <b>microgrooves</b> on the conical slide micro bearings can be observed. On the basis of the results, one can conclude, that applying <b>microgrooves</b> on the bearing sleeve surface causes the increase of the value of hydrodynamic pressure and longitudinal and transverse components of the load carrying capacity of the bearing. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>microgrooves</b> and their impact is noticeable in graphs of hydrodynamic pressure distribution. The applied method of investigation of the impact of <b>microgrooves</b> on a bearing operation is simpler and less expensive than the experimental studies, however it is necessary to verify that the results obtained with this method are correct and whether in fact applying <b>microgrooves,</b> besides form facilitate lubrication, causes the improvement in bearing operating parameters...|$|R
2500|$|Thin, closely spaced {{spiral grooves}} {{that allow for}} {{increased}} playing time on a rpm <b>microgroove</b> LP lead to a tinny pre-echo warning of upcoming loud sounds. The cutting stylus unavoidably transfers some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. It is discernible by some listeners throughout certain recordings, but a quiet passage followed by a loud sound will allow anyone to hear a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time. This problem can also appear as [...] "post"-echo, with a tinny ghost of the sound arriving 1.8 seconds after its main impulse.|$|E
2500|$|For {{collectible}} or nostalgia purposes, or for {{the benefit}} of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups, a small number of 78rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production. The most notable attempt at this was in 1951, when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records, which released a series of 78rpm-mastered albums that were <b>microgroove</b> and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves). This series came in heavy manilla envelopes and began with a jazz album AP-1 and was soon followed by other AP numbers up through about AP-19. Around 1953 the standard LP had proven itself to Nunn and he switched to rpm and began using art slicks on a more standard cardboard sleeve. The Audiophile numbers can be found into the hundreds today but the most collectable ones are the early 78rpm releases, especially the first, AP-1. The 78rpm speed was mainly {{to take advantage of the}} wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78rpm can provide for vinyl <b>microgroove</b> records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s [...] "hi-fi" [...] era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before). Also around 1953, Bell Records released a series of budget-priced plastic 7-inch 78rpm pop music singles.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} through the 1960s, in the U.S. the common home record player or [...] "stereo" [...] (after the {{introduction}} of stereo recording) would typically have had these features: a three- or four-speed player (78, 45, , and sometimes rpm); with changer, a tall spindle that would hold several records and automatically drop a new record {{on top of the}} previous one when it had finished playing, a combination cartridge with both 78 and <b>microgroove</b> styli and a way to flip between the two; and some kind of adapter for playing the 45s with their larger center hole. The adapter could be a small solid circle that fit onto the bottom of the spindle (meaning only one 45 could be played at a time) or a larger adaptor that fit over the entire spindle, permitting a stack of 45s to be played.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{alignment}} {{plays an}} important role in the repair of damaged peripheral nerves. The aligned Schwann cells could direct the axonal outgrowth during nerve reconstruction. One way of aligning Schwann cells is to use surface grooves in micrometric dimensions. In this study, <b>microgrooves</b> on chitosan or polyd,(D, L-lactide) (PLA) were fabricated and the behaviors of Schwann cells and glial cell line C 6 on these surfaces were examined. It was found that Schwann cells and C 6 cells could be successfully aligned by the <b>microgrooves,</b> and express the genes related to the production of neurotrophic factors. The polymer conduits with <b>microgrooves</b> on the inner surface were implanted in rats to repair the damaged sciatic nerve.

2500|$|After World War II, two new {{competing}} formats came {{onto the}} market and gradually replaced the standard 78rpm: the rpm (often just {{referred to as the}} 33rpm), and the 45rpm (see above). The rpm LP (for [...] "long-play") format was developed by Columbia Records and marketed in June 1948. The first LP release consisted of 85 12-inch classical pieces starting with the Mendelssohn violin concerto, Nathan Milstein violinist, Philharmonic Symphony of New York conducted by Bruno Walter, Columbia ML-4001. Also released in June 1948 were three series of 10-inch [...] "LPs" [...] and a 7-inch [...] "ZLP". RCA Victor developed the 45rpm format and marketed it in March 1949. The 45s released by RCA in March 1949 were in seven different colors of vinyl {{depending on the type of}} music recorded, blues, country, popular etc. Columbia and RCA Victor pursued their own R in secret. Both types of new disc used narrower grooves, intended to be played with smaller stylus—typically 0.001inches ("1 mil", 25µm) wide, compared to 0.003inches (76µm) for a 78—so the new records were sometimes called <b>Microgroove.</b> In the mid-1950s all record companies agreed to a common recording standard called RIAA equalization. Prior to the establishment of the standard each company used its own preferred standard, requiring discriminating listeners to use pre-amplifiers with multiple selectable equalization curves.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} technique combining {{phase transition}} and microprinting in one step {{was applied to}} fabricate the nerve conduits used in peripheral nerve regeneration.

The symmetric/asymmetric porous poly(D, L-lactide) (PLA) substrates with <b>microgrooves</b> on the surface were tested {{for their ability to}} repair 10 mm sciatic nerve transection defects in rats. The in vivo results showed that porous PLA conduits maintained a stable supporting structure during the entire regeneration process. The myelin sheaths of the regenerated nerve in asymmetric conduits were thicker than in symmetric groups at 4 weeks. Moreover, the regenerated nerves in the asymmetric conduits with surface <b>microgrooves</b> had the highest degree of myelination at 4 weeks and the most number of vessels at 6 weeks. The walking track analysis also implied that the asymmetric conduits with surface <b>microgrooves</b> had the highest degree of functional recovery.

40|$|The {{variation}} in the frost structure {{on a number of}} <b>microgrooved</b> brass surfaces is examined through an experimental study. The <b>microgrooved</b> samples are 45 mm x 45 mm in dimension with a broad range of groove dimensions. Frost is grown on these <b>microgrooved</b> surfaces under natural convection for a range of plate temperature (- 8 to - 18 o C) and relative humidity (30 - 70 %) conditions. The frost structure on the <b>microgrooved</b> surfaces, especially at the early stages of frost formation, is found to be significantly affected by the groove geometry (i. e. groove depth and pillar width). Coalescence of the condensed and hence frozen droplets, covering multiple pillars and grooves, is found to occur more frequently on the surfaces with shallow grooves and/or narrow pillars. For surfaces with intermediate groove depth and pillar width, a regular (brick-wall-like) frost pattern on the pillar surface is observed. Thickness and density of frost layer on the <b>microgrooved</b> surfaces are also found to vary with the dimension of the grooves in frost cycles up to 4 hours long. The relationships between frost structure, frost properties, and frost melt-water drainage is discussed, emphasizing the importance of these morphological features...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{femtosecond}} laser processing enabled the structuring of six types of surfaces on titanium- 6 aluminium- 4 vanadium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) plates. The obtained hierarchical features {{consisted of a}} combination of <b>microgrooves</b> and oriented nanostructures. By adjusting beam properties such as laser polarization, the width of the <b>microgrooves</b> (20 or 60 μm) and the orientation of the nanostructures (parallel or perpendicular to the <b>microgrooves)</b> can be precisely controlled. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) grown on these structured surfaces produced cytoplasmic extensions with focal contacts, while on the smooth titanium, the cells were found to be well spread and without any focal contact 12 h postseeding. The 600 -nm wide nanostructures on their own were sufficient to orient the MSCs. For the multiscale structured areas, when the orientation of the nanostructures was orthogonal in relation to the <b>microgrooves,</b> there was an important decrease in or even a loss of cell alignment signifying that cells were sensitive to the directional nanostructures in the <b>microgrooves.</b> At 7 days, cell proliferation was not affected but the direction of nanostructures controlled the matrix organization.

Understanding the mechanism of how surface topography influences mammalian cells is critical for the development of medical implants and tissue engineering. In this study, we investigated the influences of nanoporous and <b>microgrooved</b> substrates on the morphology and migration of hepatic cell line, BEL- 7402 cells. Cells were cultured on nanoporous (140 nm in diameter) anodized alumina membrane (AAM), nanoporous (140 nm in diameter) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and <b>microgrooves</b> (10 μm, 30 μm, and 50 μm in width, and 2 μm in depth) patterned PDMS, then imaged by fluorescent microscopy, time-lapse microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell morphology and migration were investigated through image analysis. The results suggest that the nanoporous and <b>microgrooved</b> surface structure induced totally different changes on BEL- 7402 cells. Compared to the well-spread cells on the flat surface plate, the cells formed spheroids on the nanoporous AAM surface and nanoporous PDMS surface with no elongation and alignment, while the cells grew with elongated and aligned morphology along the <b>microgrooves</b> on the PDMS substrates. The BEL- 7402 cell migration speed was significantly higher on the nanoporous substrates than on the flat surfaces. On the <b>microgrooved</b> PDMS substrates, the cells migrated along the groove direction and showed relatively small difference of the overall velocity compared to the cells on the flat PDMS surface. Our findings provide insights into the control of cell morphological features and migratory behaviour by using artificial nanoporous or <b>microgrooved</b> substrates, which can benefit the research on hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, tissue engineering, and medical implant design.
