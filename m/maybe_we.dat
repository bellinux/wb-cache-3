Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> never see him again or <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E

40|$|The pattern {{matching}} calculi {{introduced by the}} first author are a refinement of the λ-calculus that integrates mechanisms appropriate for fine-grained modelling of non-strict {{pattern matching}}. While related work in the literature only uses a single monad, typically <b>Maybe,</b> for matchings, <b>we</b> present an axiomatic approach to semantics of these pattern matching calculi using two monads, one for expressions and one for matchings. Although these two monads only need to be relatively lightly coupled, this semantics implies soundness of all core PMC rules, and is {{a useful tool for}} exploration of the design space for pattern matching calculi. Using lifting and <b>Maybe</b> monads, <b>we</b> obtain standard Haskell semantics, and by adding another level of <b>Maybe</b> to both, <b>we</b> obtain a denotational semantics of the “matching failure as exceptions” approach of Erwig and Peyton Jones.

She responded, [...] "This was a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial.

500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E

Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week.

Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time.

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level.

500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> could look to other commandments?" ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Maybe,</b> before <b>we</b> {{speak of}} time, or <b>maybe</b> whilst <b>we</b> are {{speaking}} of time, or <b>maybe</b> after <b>we</b> have spoken of time, {{in the various}} modes of time’s insistence to exist, one should give time to the talk of time. There are various different modes of time’s insistence to exist, such as quantum physics in conversation with relativity theory where time is constructed as a fourth dimension of space. Or there are the modes of time in history, religion, psychology and philosophy, and each of these modes is composed, and composes its own specific object called time, and a particular subject who understands and interprets time in that particular mode. Yet, before, whilst or after these modes of time’s insistence to exist, one should maybe give time to time’s insistence: the talk of time. Give time for the various times to articulate themselves in the various modes of existence, thereby creating both a whole plurality of differing subjects, as well as plurality of differing objects, all called ‘time’. Once time has been given time to talk its talk, to articulate itself within the various modes, it will be interrupted by the articulations of time in various modes of time still to come. These disruptions of time by time always still to come {{opens the door for}} a theological narrative – a narrative on time, but created by the coming of messianic times, interpreted in the mode of hope but also in the mode of a promise from the past.

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line.

The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out".
