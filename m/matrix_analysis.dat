25|$|Ray {{transfer}} <b>matrix</b> <b>analysis</b> (also {{known as}} ABCD <b>matrix</b> <b>analysis)</b> {{is a type}} of ray tracing technique used in the design of some optical systems, particularly lasers. It involves the construction of a ray transfer matrix which describes the optical system; tracing of a light path through the system can then be performed by multiplying this matrix with a vector representing the light ray. The same analysis is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see Beam optics.|$|E
