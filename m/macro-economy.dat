2500|$|However, many of {{the aspects}} of the social-democratic welfare state {{continued}} to function at a high level, due {{in no small part}} to the high rate of unionization in Sweden, the independence of unions in wage-setting, and the exemplary competency of the feminized public sector workforce, as well as widespread public support. The Social Democrats initiated studies on the effects of the neoliberal changes, and the picture that emerged from those findings allowed the party to reduce many tax expenditures, slightly increase taxes on high income-earners, and significantly reduce taxes on food. The Social Democratic Finance Minister increased spending on child support and continued to pay down the public debt. By 1998 the Swedish <b>macro-economy</b> recovered from the 1980s industrial restructuring and the currency policy excesses. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Sweden has a well-regarded, generally robust economy, and the average quality of life, after government transfers, is very high, inequality is low (the Gini coefficient is [...]28), and social mobility is high (compared to the affluent Anglo-American and Central European countries).|$|E

40|$|The {{breakthroughs}} in microbiology have {{allowed us to}} come to terms with the microbial resources present in culture collections and in natural environments. The challenge at present is to manage these microbial resources, particularly when one deals with open systems where the dynamics of microbial ecology are predominant. Hence, to properly address the aspects of Microbial Resource Management (MRM), one needs to handle the questions of who is there, who is doing what with whom and how can one adjust, control and/or steer these mixed cultures and communities. It is argued that microbial ecologists and environmental microbiologists need to address a new mind-set. The Beijerinck axioma that all microorganisms are everywhere should not be presumed to be generally valid. The Darwin based niche assembly concept needs to be supplemented with the neutral theory of Hubbell. The Pareto 80 / 20 principle is also applicable to the <b>macro-economies</b> of microbial communities. Finally, the concept of a stable microbial community should be replaced by that of a cooperative community continuum. Overall, MRM is at the basis of a number of new developments in domains such as environmental safety and health, renewable energy production, closing environmental cycles and providing new materials. Specific examples such as, for example, pro-active immuno-stimulation by means of drinking water, electro-microbiology, decreasing global warming by implementation of methanotrophs and generation of nano-biocatalysts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the relationship between macroeconomic variables and the stock market index for UK and US in London Stock Exchange (LSE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by carrying out the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) multiple regression for the period of eleven years from February 2001 up to November 2011. In this study, we consider the quarterly data of six macroeconomic variables which are: interest rate, foreign exchange rate & reserve, gross fixed capital formation, money supply, inflation, and industrial production respectively. Due to the uniqueness of the sample period which contains the financial crisis and recession period, the study intend to find the effect of the crisis on the stock market, hence, a dummy variable Crisis (CR) is added to the regression. However, the financial crisis only has significant influence on the US stock market, while no significant relationship is found for the UK stock market. This study extends approach by focusing on the performance of the stock market as a whole and comparing the effects of the movements in the two different economies of UK and US on the fluctuations in stock prices. The results of the regression analysis indicate that the UK stock price volatility is significantly positively related to interest rate, money supply and industrial production index, while exchange rate, inflation rate and gross fixed capital formation can significantly negatively affect the UK stock market index. As for the US stock index, it is discovered to be significantly positively related to interest rate, foreign exchange rate & reserves and money supply, and only gross fixed capital formation significantly negatively contributes to the changes in the US stock index. Both of the UK and US model have strong explanatory power of the detected significant determinants in explaining the changes in the <b>macro-economies.</b> The empirical results of this study could be used as valuable information for local and global stock investors who seek an investment opportunity in the UK and US stock markets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} Villani and Frattarelli present the {{specific}} case of Livorno, an Italian port city newly founded in early modern times, which drew inhabitants of many kinds: marginal people, artisans and great merchants, not exclusively Catholic. The {{growth of the}} city and the port and the presence of various “nations” made Livorno in the modern age a particularly dynamic place for international exchange, an important hub that connected the Mediterranean trade with the <b>macro-economies</b> of the European colonial powers. Fundamental studies conducted on sources preserved in European and Italian archives have provided a detailed picture of its importance for the trade of the northern powers in the Mediterranean and shown the constitution of “foreign” economic groups that maintained networks of relations with the commercial centers of their countries of origin. Moreover Livorno was also a centre from which intercultural relations were projected out over the Mediterranean and beyond, since merchants from Livorno traded even with Hindu merchants in India. The opportunities for peaceful co-existence established by the Privileges for Eastern and Western Merchants, which are known because of their success with the name of the Livornina or Leghorn privileges, guaranteed in fact a certain degree of ‘tolerance’ and supported the development of trade and the growth in the city of a population of immigrants from both neighbouring regions and distant countries. The history of the population of Livorno is in fact the history of growth, politically planned and assisted; just as the formation of an urban elite and the organisation of foreigners in nations was the result of the pragmatic policy of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany and their interest in developing merchant networks. The particular case of the English community of Livorno illustrates concretely how the immigration of populations of different faiths and cultures created conflicts and divisions, and allows us to discuss the controversial topos of cosmopolitism and tolerance towards non-Catholic minorities, the privileges of the Jewish population, the mixing of languages and ethnic groups. The documents of the Medici Grand Duchy and the records of the tribunal of the Inquisition throw into relief how in an Italian port city in the ‘confessional age’, thanks to the protection of state mercantilism, it was possible to establish a regime of co-existence including Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which allowed individuals to establish business and sometimes friendly relations, although it was not possible, except in cases of formally leaving one’s original faith, to cross the barriers of religious denomination and enter fully into the ranks of citizen...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of the pharmaceutical industry in China {{was found to be}} predominantly driven by economic factors. The nature of an industrial region can roughly fall into one of the following three types: natural resource-driven region, economy-driven region and science and technology-driven region.

Moreover, it is shown that the stronger the <b>macro-economy,</b> the faster the pharmaceutical industry grows. Therefore, the decision-making policy on pharmaceutical development in a region should be largely based on its macroeconomic situation.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of stable macroeconomic environments was the foundation {{upon which the}} Asian miracle was built. Each of the Four Asian Tiger states managed, to various degrees of success, three variables in: budget deficits, external debt and exchange rates. Each Tiger nation's budget deficits were kept {{within the limits of}} their financial limits, as to not destabilize the <b>macro-economy.</b> South Korea in particular had deficits lower than the OECD average in the 1980s. External debt was non-existent for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as they did not borrow from abroad. Although South Korea was the exception to this - its debt to GNP ratio was quite high during the period 1980-1985, it was sustained by the country’s high level of exports. Exchange rates in the Four Asian Tiger nations had been changed from long-term fixed rate regimes to fixed-but-adjustable rate regimes with the occasional steep devaluation of managed floating rate regimes. This active exchange rate management allowed the 4 Tiger economies to avoid exchange rate appreciation and maintain a stable real exchange rate.|$|E
