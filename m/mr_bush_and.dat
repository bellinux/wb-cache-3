40|$|David Bowman on John Pilger and the Daily Mirror’s American {{shareholder}} IT WAS {{a headline}} in the Age last April Fool’s Day that caught the eye at the time: "Foreign ownership of media not important, says Alston. " 	 What a wizard sense of humour, I thought. But in fact Senator Alston seemed to be serious. The Communications Minister was saying, according to the Age, that Australians would not notice any change if, under proposed new ownership rules, foreigners bought our television stations and newspapers. And indeed there’s {{a good deal of}} truth in that, which makes it a very good reason not, repeat not, to open up the mass media to foreign ownership. Open up, and, true, people might not notice much or even any change. But difference of a kind nevertheless would exist. It might best be described as a latent difference. An influential mass-circulation newspaper under foreign ownership is vulnerable to decisions involving policy, made at critical times from a foreign perspective, by people who at root may have not only a business interest but a wider political or social agenda of their own. Should more of them be allowed to put their oar into our political boat? Something happened last month that throws more light on this business of foreign ownership. It should be seen, I think, as a warning that the Communications Minister was either a fool or a propagandist last April, if that Age report was accurate. It may be best to tell the story chronologically; it is the tale of a British newspaper offending a shareholder in America. THE London Daily Mirror is a tabloid, partly owned by American capital, with a circulation over two million, which in its 99 years has seen both greatness and wretched times. John Pilger came to fame there, in days when it was a serious popular tabloid. A few months ago, 15 years after his time, the Mirror revived the serious high days, turning again to John Pilger to contribute campaigning journalism of quality. Now the story begins. On 4 July, the Daily Mirror published an enormously powerful front page. George W. Bush stood centre, exhibiting a kind of pride and reverence, and flanked by huge American flags. The sledgehammer headline said MOURN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. In large type above Mr Bush, these words appeared: George W. Bush’s policy of bomb first and find out later has killed double the number of civilians who died on 11 September. The USA is now the world’s leading rogue state. These sentiments came from the related Pilger article, in which casualty figures were based on a study carried out at the University of New Hampshire. The article was a full-blooded assault on the actions and policies of "the Bush gang" in Afghanistan and beyond; "gang", according to the Pilger dictionary, being "a group of people working together for criminal, disreputable ends". That, said Mr Pilger, described accurately <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> those who wrote his speeches and made his decisions and who, since their rise to power, had undermined the very basis of international law. He wrote of "the systematic, murderous way" the US military has operated in Afghanistan, and the apparent failure to round up Al Qaeda leaders; of the Bush strategy to "stabilise" Afghanistan for American oil and other strategic interests; of US military bases established to fight the war against terrorism, {{and at the same time}} reportedly following the route of a projected pipeline carrying Asian oil to the Indian Ocean; of the seeming Bush objective of ordering the world around the requirements of US monopoly capital, and the strategy for that. He concluded with an Orwellian view of such a world. The only way to resist "such rogue power", he said, was by speaking out now. WOULD any of our mainstream press have published the Pilger article? Not utterly unthinkable. On July 3, the Sydney Morning Herald carried an edited extract from the new Pilger book, The New Rulers of the World, describing the "war on terrorism" as "the great charade", in reality the return journey of imperialism to respectability. This too was a trenchant piece. The Advertiser, to its credit, carried a 200 -word news report from London of the Daily Mirror article of July 4, but nothing of the American reaction. That sequel is the point of the following account, which draws on an article by Roy Greenslade of the London Guardian. In Greenslade’s view, the material in Pilger’s article could not come close to being published in a mainstream American paper. He recalled the immortal words of Corporal Jones of Dad’s Army (who, I seem to remember, was discussing the finer points of bayoneting) : "They don’t like it up ‘em, sir, they don’t like it one bit". The editor-in-chief of the very conservative Washington Times, which is owned by the Unification Church (the Moonies), described the Mirror as "a shrill tabloid read by London’s lip-readers, soccer hooligans and other mutants". John Pilger was a "distinguished war correspondent" who "speaks for a lot of the bad-breath left in Old Blighty". Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post called the Mirror "a terrorist-loving London tabloid", and paraded a two-year-old share-dealing embarrassment involving the editor, Piers Morgan. According to the New York Press, an on-line publication, the July 4 issue was "a filthy document", and the article "bilge". The extreme sensitivity accords with John Pilger’s reading as a visitor of the American mood, with the mainstream media mostly too busy saluting the flag to question where the flag might be leading them. It should surprise no one, though perhaps it will, that in this atmosphere there should have been a reaction from an American shareholder in the Mirror company. WHEN Tom Shrager, fund manager with an American investment company, rang Philip Graf, chief executive of Trinity-Mirror, which owns the Mirror, it was to complain forthrightly that his company was very unhappy that the Mirror should have published John Pilger’s piece. Later, questioned by Roy Greenslade, Mr Shrager said he had simply wanted to register his disappointment about the Daily Mirror’s coverage to its owners. He had begun by telling Mr Graf that he was strongly committed to freedom of the press, but that this freedom depended on its being used responsibly and fairly. He said (Mr Greenslade reported), "The Mirror wasn’t fair and wasn’t accurate". Mr Graf is not merely an investor watching the business performance of the company. He holds political views, or acts for someone who does. Clearly, the purpose of his call must have been not merely to complain, but to achieve at the least a less critical coverage in future of Bush policies as they affect the rest of the world. 		 What did Trinity-Mirror think of this? Mr Graf would not discuss the Shrager call. A senior executive said, "This is a very delicate matter". Indeed. The owner of a major British newspaper is being asked by an American investor to tone down what the paper publishes in a matter of enormous importance to the British. Perhaps Mr Shrager expected or hoped that Mr Graf would have a word with the editor. Mr Shrager did not threaten to sell any stock. His company holds a 4 per cent stake in Trinity-MIrror. It is one of three New York investment companies that together hold 31 per cent. If they felt inclined to act in concert, serious things might happen. 	 The Mirror editor has promised to go on publishing Pilger articles critical of Mr Bush. He said they shouldn’t be construed as anti-American. THERE is no reason to suppose that Mr Shrager is the first foreign investor to try to affect the editorial direction of a newspaper in the interests of a foreign government, or for some other significant purpose. Human nature being as it is, interference of this kind is inevitable. It is a form of corruption, it carries peculiar dangers, and newspapers are too influential in public life for it to be tolerated in any democracy with a shred of national pride. The public knows this - opinion polls are heavily against foreign ownership of the media - but it is the politicians, anxious to placate the businessmen controlling the major media, who in this country want to throw our media wide open to foreign investment. Senator Alston, like most members of the Howard cabinet, is besotted with the idea, and Labor is soft in that direction. A huge slab of our major press is already foreign-owned, through the Murdochs. If you were President Bush, and uncertain of Australian support in some adventure ahead, would you not consider a lunch with Rupert Murdoch to suggest that his Australian papers might help? Oh, it would be in Australia’s interests, of course it would be in Australia’s interests. Mr Murdoch might already have decided as much; but then he might not. He might just have been awaiting a timely prompt. Advocates of foreign ownership try to meet this argument, if they address it at all, by saying foreign owners know that should they misuse their papers they would lose circulation and fail as a business. Such nonsense that is; these things are done in a very careful way. The chance that Senator Alston will succeed in opening up foreign ownership seems, along with his other plans for change, quite dim for the moment. But only public vigilance can stop the politicians and the media businessmen from eventually demolishing, climbing over or marching around whatever barriers impede their purposes and their ambitions. Their self-interest never sleeps; public interest wakes from time to time. • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.

40|$|THIS is a faith-restoring thing, {{to see a}} {{newspaper}} show a flash of honest insight and capture a great truth when others are wilfully ignoring it or too timid to speak up. 	Atop the front page on Saturday 21 September, 400, 000 copies of the Sydney Morning Herald carried a jolting headline that said Bush: how I&# 8217;ll rule the world. Let me emphasise that the Herald is a serious paper, not given to scaremongering. The headline announced the arrival in our time of a man bent on giving shape and force to the vague idea &# 8212; vague {{in the public mind}} &# 8212; that world-wide dominion was now the manifest destiny of the United States. 	The Herald report accompanying the headline came from the New York Times, and described a new 33 -page public document, The National Security Strategy of the United States. This spells out Mr Bush&# 8217;s determination to enforce America&# 8217;s global domination, insisting America will allow no other power to challenge its military and economic supremacy. 	The previously-announced shift to pre-emptive military action will see such action used against terrorist groups and any foreign states judged to be hostile. Thus the long-standing policies of containment and deterrence, intended to avoid war, no longer apply. (One thinks of George Orwell and Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the world he describes of several blocs engaged in a state of more or less perpetual, indecisive long-range warfare, which becomes just part of life.) 	The Herald/ New York Times report says much of the document focuses on how public diplomacy, the use of foreign aid, and changes in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can be used to win what the document calls a battle of competing values and ideas, including &# 8220;a battle {{for the future of the}} Muslim world&# 8221;. 	Foreign aid is to be increased by half in the next few years, for (the document says) &# 8220;countries whose governments rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom&# 8221;. 	Encouragement of economic freedom, along with the involvement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, should not, I think, be naively taken as merely benevolently inspired. History suggests the explanation lies more in the domain of American imperialism and economic colonialism. 	The document insists (says the Herald report) that the US will exploit its military and economic power to encourage &# 8220;free and open societies&# 8221; rather than seek &# 8220;unilateral advantage&# 8221;. This is described as &# 8220;a distinctly American internationalism&# 8221;. 	Yes indeed. All this, and Utopia too. 	HAVING recognised the significance of Mr Bush&# 8217;s document, and displayed the report accordingly, the Herald took it up as the main leading article of the day. This was headlined The Bush vision, fearful and unfree. 	Bush&# 8217;s America, says the Herald, is so unfamiliar and so difficult to grasp in its implications that it has generated profound unease [...] . &# 8220;The document provides the first comprehensive rationale for shifting US military strategy towards pre-emptive action, such as now seems likely against Iraq. It also talks extensively of the need for diplomacy to achieve peace and freedom. But the peace and freedom are always on American terms, victory in a battle of competing values and ideas &# 8212; including &# 8216;a battle for the future of the Muslim world&# 8217;. Diplomacy will always be subordinate to military superiority. The President, [the document] says, &# 8216;has no intention of allowing any foreign power to catch up with the huge lead the United States has opened since the fall of the Soviet Union more than a decade ago&# 8217;. &# 8221; 	The Bush explanation for shifting from the old policy of deterrence and containment is simplistic, the Herald argues, and goes on to another failure: &# 8220;The searing experience of [...] . September 11 last year permeates the document &# 8212; and suffuses it with fear, concealed in language of pride and determination. &# 8216;America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones&# 8217;, it says. &# 8216;We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. &# 8217; It makes scant effort to go beneath the surface of that bitterness to examine its causes and reflect upon them, to explore solutions which rely more on diplomacy than on America&# 8217;s present &# 8216;unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence&# 8217;. &# 8221; 	As to Australia&# 8217;s role in this world of Mr Bush&# 8217;s, it would appear to have been chosen for us. The Herald editorial concludes very sharply indeed: &# 8220;As part of enhancing &# 8216;our Asian alliances and friendships&# 8217;, the document says, the US &# 8216;will build on 50 years of US-Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional problems &# 8212; as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora&# 8217;. That is all very well. But it would be more reassuring to Australia as well as America&# 8217;s other allies if there were greater acknowledgment that the world is more complicated than this aggressive and frighteningly naive document suggests. &# 8221; 	THE ADELAIDE Advertiser published nothing of Mr Bush&# 8217;s document on the Saturday or the Monday. Saturday&# 8217;s front page was given over entirely to football. The main editorial (&# 8220;A weekend of people&# 8217;s history in the making [...] . South Australians will walk taller today&# 8221;) was also devoted to football. 	 	The Australian, in my edition at least, also published nothing on the Saturday or the Monday. *	 	THE Sydney Morning Herald did not describe Mr Bush as a cowboy, or arrogant, or a fool, or a featherweight, or a megalomaniac &# 8212; none of those things &# 8212; and in these times of uncivil media is to be admired for its heroic restraint. Jack Balkin, who is professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School, has fewer inhibitions. In a Sydney Morning Herald article of 23 September, he described Mr Bush in a measured way as a bully, belligerent, arrogant and sure of himself, and truly the most dangerous person on Earth. That article came from the Washington Post, an important paper by anyone&# 8217;s count. 	The possibilities in the Bush doctrine are of course virtually limitless. On September 9, for example, the Sydney Morning Herald carried a report headed Overthrowing Saddam &# 8216;just the first step&# 8217;. This appears to have come from either the Boston Globe or the Washington Post. The burden was that the most hawkish members of the Bush Administration see Syria and Iran as next in line for regime change after Saddam. 	Can anyone see the Arab peoples accepting rulers installed by the United States throughout the Middle East? People seem to be drunk on power. But even America&# 8217;s power has limits. 	The question for Australia is how far the Howard government or any successor will take the country in support of the Bush doctrine. Will it one day be as far as China? The idea is appalling. Without doubt, we will join in any American war on Iraq and its unlucky people, whatever line the United Nations may take and whatever the possible consequences. There is no evidence yet to justify an American attack, but if expedient some can be manufactured; which may have been done by the time this article appears. 	The Australian media, which with few exceptions is as craven and unprincipled as the politicians, can be expected to put the best face on things if the government formally plumps for war. The Sydney Morning Herald, which has been consistently and sometimes trenchantly critical of both <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> Mr Howard for their cavalier attitude towards the United Nations, can be expected to stick firmly to the principle of UN jurisdiction and international law, and not accept any transparently false excuse for war. Perhaps the most interesting element will be what the American-controlled Murdoch empire has to say. If and when it has all caught up with the Bush doctrine, will it be Australia&# 8217;s interests that clearly prevail? Rohan Rivett 	Last month I wrote of an injustice to the reputation of the late Rohan Rivett, a great editor of the now-defunct Adelaide News. In a speech in relation to the Stuart case, Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court had conferred on Rupert Murdoch the credit due to Mr Rivett for helping to save Max Stuart from the gallows. Justice Kirby has since made this good in an article, based on the speech, for Volume 23 of the Adelaide Law Review, due out later this year. 	Black and White, the film of the Stuart case, is another matter. I shall report Mr Rivett&# 8217;s treatment when it is publicly released. 	My article said that in the libel cases brought unsuccessfully against Mr Rivett, he was represented by Dr J. J. Bray, QC, with H. G. Alderman. In fact C. L.

[...] During the early 1980s, after statistics had shown that foreign born immigrants from Latin America had nearly quintupled just since 1960, statistics showed that 35 million adults could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million {{were not able to}} read beyond a fourth-grade level. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush's</b> Story Time, a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children. Today, her children Jeb <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> Doro <b>Bush</b> Koch serve as co-chairs of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> remains active in the foundation and serves as honorary chair.|$|R

Former Vice President Spiro Agnew also attended. A Congressional delegation consisting of over one hundred members was present, and a foreign diplomatic corps of over two hundred. The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, a friend of Richard Nixon's, who called him [...] "one of the most misunderstood men, and I think he was one of the greatest men of the century." [...] Eulogies were delivered by Graham, Henry Kissinger, Senator Bob Dole, Pete Wilson, Governor of California, and President Clinton. Dole could not hold back his tears at the end of his speech, a rare show of emotion in public for the Senator.|$|R
40|$|The Variable Displacement Engine (VDE) {{is a new}} {{generation}} of engines that are designed to decrease the fuel consumption at the cruise speed of a vehicle. The isolation of the VDE's new vibration pattern is beyond the capabilities of conventional mounts and bushings. Consequently, in this thesis, novel active and semi-active solutions are proposed to develop various semi-active <b>and</b> active hydraulic <b>bushing</b> proof-of-concept systems that may solve the isolation problem in a VDE system. The dynamic stiffness response, which is the transfer function that relates the engine displacement to the transmitted force, is normally used as the key design criterion for engine mounts and bushings. In this thesis, a linear mathematical model of a conventional hydraulic bushing is purposed. The validity of the mathematical model is confirmed by an experimental analysis, and the various parameters in the dynamic stiffness equation are evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the dynamic stiffness frequency response of the conventional hydraulic bushing has both soft and stiff regions. The soft region is limited to low frequencies. For the VDE isolation, the goal is to provide a soft bushing for a wider range of frequencies than a conventional bushing can accommodate. Addition of a short inertia track, similar to a decoupler used in conventional hydraulic engine mounts, may be used to extend the soft region of a conventional hydraulic <b>bushing,</b> <b>and</b> the experimental results validate it. Since the short inertia track provides no additional damping, a supplementary Magnetorheological (MR) valve is also devised. The MR valve has the advantage to minimize the amount of MR fluid used, which significantly reduces the cost of the overall system. The novel valve allows the damping coefficient of the bushing assembly to be controlled by varying the electrical current input to a solenoid coil. A mathematical model is derived for the <b>MR</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>and</b> is validated experimentally. In addition, an active bushing to solve the VDE isolation problem is purposed in this thesis. In this bushing, a magnetic actuator, composed of a permanent magnet and a solenoid coil, is included in the active bushing. This active chamber affects the dynamic stiffness response of the bushing by altering the bushing's internal pressure. The nonlinear equation of motion of the permanent magnet is linearized and is incorporated into the new mathematical model of the system. The new purposed model for the active bushing is in good agreement with the experimental results. This active chamber is also proved capable of producing complex dynamic stiffness frequency response. The conclusion is that the proposals in this thesis can contribute to the isolation of the vibration pattern, imposed by the application of a VDE system...|$|R
