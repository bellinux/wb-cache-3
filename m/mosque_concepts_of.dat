50|$|In {{addition}} to the general restoration and enhancement of the mosque, it will now have a total of 99 domes of different diameters, 75 feet above the floor. The large dome will be of gold finish while the four big domes around it will be coated in green with reflective illumination. The mosque form is enveloped within a pyramid shape with a square base and 45 inclinations for the faces. It has four accessible minarets, each standing at a height of 150 feet. Moreover, all the dilapidated domes and minarets with mosaic finishing will be restored and finished with cut-to-size marble. The exterior and interior will also be covered by special marble while the expanded courtyard will be constructed with heat-absorbing granite (marble) finish. The doors and windows will be replaced with specially designed ones befitting the new <b>mosque</b> <b>concept.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} about Edmond Dantes' changing <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. I {{apply the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice to explain Edmond Dantes' early <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice and restorative justice {{to explain his}} latter <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. I see that Edmond Dantes changes his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice, from retributive justice to restorative justice. The main reason why Edmond Dantes applies his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive is {{the pain and suffering}} which he gets from his enemies. Edmond Dantes applies the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice to make an equal pain and suffering. However, after he executes his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice, Edmond Dantes has a state of fear and emptiness. These fear and emptiness then make Edmond Dantes change his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice to restorative justice. Edmond Dantes applies the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> restorative justice as a payment for the troubles created by his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice. I apply the theory of utilitarianism to explain why Edmond Dantes changes his early <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice to his latter <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. As the conclusion, {{there are lots of things}} that can be learned especially about justice. Edmond Dantes' case shows that retributive justice is not a perfect <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice because it will create another trouble. On one hand, restorative justice can give the solution to the problem...|$|R

Kaufman reformulates the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God. For Kaufman the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> world and nature are religiously relevant insofar as they call for a theology for our contemporary life centred in this world rather than in some metaphysical beyond. This study examines how Kaufman articulates a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God that is not necessarily bound by the traditions of a particular religion, but also whether he offers a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God for the so-called 'secular' modern world. Chapter one examines how Kaufman conceives of the difference between world and nature. Chapter two relates the analysis <b>of</b> these <b>concepts</b> to the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God as well as Kaufman's treatment of revelation in light of his attempts to reconstruct the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God. Chapter three considers some of Kaufman's recent suggestions for reformulating the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God that take into account the relativist and historicist perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 256 - 266. This study {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question of how Habermas "re-thinks" or "reformulates" the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> rationality and rationalization processes. The method is analytical. The early, later and most recent works of Habermas are analysed with the aim of showing that he approaches the c 6 ncept of rationality from an unusual perspective which has not been discussed in the secondary literature. Namely, the perspective of human agency and communicative judgment which is gleaned from the work of Arendt. Arendt's reconstruction <b>of</b> the Aristotelian <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> "praxis" and "poiesis" is central to the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> human agency in the work of Habermas. Habermas, like Arendt, distinguishes between action as a making process and action as a communicative process. Throughout his work he {{attempts to}} relate these two aspects of human agency to the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> rationality, knowledge, and autonomy. Arendt's reconstruction <b>of</b> Kant's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> reflective judgement is fundamental to Habermas' most recent argument for grounding the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> rationality in general. Here Habermas links Arendt's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> communicative judgement, men/women's capacity for saying "Yes/No" with the accompanying reasons, to universal validity claims which are recognized and redeemed through dialogue between at least two subjects. Another closely related theme which is internal to the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> human agency and which permeates the fabric of Habermas' work is Arendt's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> plurality. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> plurality is fundamental to the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> intersubjective recognition and consensus formation in Habermas' work. I show how Habermas uses the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> intersubjectivity to clarify his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> practical rationality in his later work and how intersubjective recognition is central to his most recent argument for grounding the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> rationality in general. Habermas moves beyond the work of Arendt in his efforts to appropriate and re-formulate the Enlightenment <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> reason {{in the light of the}} works of Marx, Freud, Weber, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Lukacs. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> reflection is revised from the viewpoint of reflective, communicative judgement. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> rationality is distinguished from the attitudes which actors adopt in apprehending their world. Piaget's decentration thesis is shown to be central to the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> communicative rationality...|$|R
