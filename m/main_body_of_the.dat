5|$|Galileo {{continued}} to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, {{he died on}} 8 January 1642, aged 77.

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, {{at the end of}} each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebra is {{a single piece of}} bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as the <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E

Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E
