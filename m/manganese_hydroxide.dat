30|$|It is {{difficult}} to evaluate manganese species in the suspension samples in detail because manganese can change its oxidation state from + 2 to + 7 and form various oxo or hydroxo complexes in aqueous solution [15]. If manganese exists as these complexes, no blocking effects would be observed because they are anionic or electrically neutral species. However, {{from the viewpoint of}} the solubility product of <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxide</b> [Mn(OH) 2] [12, 13], it is suggested that the hydroxide is not an insoluble compound when the aqueous solution is weakly basic. Thus, the concentration of manganese ion (Mn 2 +) in the liquid phase may significantly increase by the addition of OC or AC, although the contents of manganese are not so large. Nonetheless, it is predicted that manganese ion shows no significant blocking effect, because it is comparable to magnesium ion (Mg 2 +) in terms of ionic valence and radius [6, 16].|$|E

By using zeta potential measurement and a careful analysis of manganese species present in water for dosages in which <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxide</b> precipitated, we confirmed that the depression of both minerals by Mn 2 + ions is due to the following: (i) the adsorption of Mn hydroxy complexes (Mn 2 (OH) 3 + and Mn(OH) +); (ii) Mn 2 + and mainly (iii) the precipitation of Mn(OH) 2 on mineral surfaces. These effects hindered the adsorption of amine species on the surfaces of the minerals (quartz and hematite). EDTA was used to complex Mn 2 + to restore the recoveries of both minerals.

40|$|In {{order to}} model ion {{transport}} across protocell membranes in Hadean hydrothermal vents, we consider both theoretically and experimentally the planar {{growth of a}} precipitate membrane formed at the interface between two parallel fluid streams in a two-dimensional microfluidic reactor.

However, the dependence of the growth rate on the concentrations of hydroxide and metal ions is approximately linear and quadratic, respectively. We show that such a difference in ionic transport dynamics arises from the enhanced transport of metal ions across a thin gel layer present at the surface of the precipitate. The fluctuations in transverse velocity in this wavy porous gel layer allow an enhanced transport of the cation, so that the effective diffusivity is about an order of magnitude higher than that expected from molecular diffusion alone.

40|$|The {{formation}} of incrustations on {{public water supply}} well screens reduces their performance considerably. The incrustations increase hydraulic losses, reduce {{the capacity of the}} well and screen, affect the quality of the pumped water and increase maintenance costs. In alluvial environments, the most common deposits are iron and manganese hydroxides. However, the rates of formation, compositions and levels of crystallization vary, depending on the geochemical characteristics of the alluvial environment, the microbiological characteristics of the groundwater and the abstraction method. Samples of 15 incrustations were collected from wells that tap shallow alluvial aquifers and were found to be dominated by iron. XRD analyses detected low-crystalline ferrihydrite and <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxide</b> in the samples collected from the water supply source at Trnovče (Velika Morava alluvial).

40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} deposits that {{we analyzed}} from Leg 70 {{are composed of}} ferruginous green clays and fragments of manganese-hydroxide crust. Data from X-ray diffraction, IR-spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and chemical analyses indicate that the hydrothermal green clays are composed of disordered mixed-layer phases of celadonite-nontronite. Electron diffraction shows that {{the parameters of the}} unit cells and the degree of three-dimensional ordering of mixed-layer phases with 80 % celadonite interlayers are very close to Fe-micas of polymorphic modification IM-celadonite. In some sections, there is a tendency for the number of celadonite layers to increase with depth. The manganese-hydroxide crust fragments are predominantly composed of todorokite (buserite). An essential feature of hydrothermal accumulation is the sharp separation of Fe and Mn. Ba/Ti and Ba/Sr ratios are typical indicators of hydrothermal deposits. Sediments composing the hydrothermal mounds were deposited from moderately heated waters, which had extracted the components from solid basalts in environments where there were considerable gradients of temperature, eH, and pH. The main masses of Fe and Mn were deposited in the late Pleistocene. Postsedimentary alteration of deposited hydrothermal sediments led to their slight recrystallization and, in the green clays, to celadonitization. Further, factor analysis (by Varentsov) of chemical components from these hydrothermal deposits revealed paragenetic assemblages.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 There are {{two sources}} of {{contamination}} from the Hi-Yu mine: the 'mill seep' and the mine tailings. The mill seep has an acid pH (4. 8) containing 20 {{parts per billion}} (ppb) Cd and 2400 ppb Zn. Water draining the mine tailings contains 300 ppb As and 30 ppb Sb. These concentrations are above the EPA and State of Alaska Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL). Once the mill seep mixes with Moose Creek, the pH increases, leading to the precipitation of iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxides</b> with associated As, Cd, Sb, and Zn.

Applied extractants for the sequential leaches are: (A) distilled water for extracting water soluble components, (B) 1 M sodium-acetate for extracting exchangeable cations by clay minerals and co-precipitations of carbonates, (C) 0. 1 M sodium-pyrophosphate for extracting the elements bound with organic matter, (D) 0. 1 M hydroxylamine for extracting the elements bound with amorphous Mn hydroxides, and (E) 0. 25 M hydroxylamine for extracting the elements bound with amorphous Fe hydroxides and more crystallized Mn hydroxides.

40|$|The {{influence}} of lithological heterogeneities, structural discontinuities and discontinuity surface mineralisation upon groundwater migration within the Chalk and the Upper Greensand of southern England has been investigated. Lithological heterogeneities in the Chalk succession include marl seams, hardgrounds, tabular flints and nodular flints. Each of these heterogeneities {{has a lower}} intrinsic porosity and permeability than in the calcite rich chalk. The influence {{that each of these}} heterogeneities exerts upon groundwater flow is assessed in relation to the porosity and permeability of the Chalk. Clay minerals, iron oxide and dendrites of <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxide</b> are forms of discontinuity surface mineralisation. The paragenesis of these deposits is predominately from superficial deposits resting on the Chalk. The presence of mineralisation reduces the porosity and permeability of discontinuity surfaces. Mineralisation reduces the exchange between water in discontinuities with that in the matrix. In the matrix, parallel to the discontinuity surface, a zone of enhanced porosity occurs, formed by the dissolution of the Chalk matrix. Parallel to this zone is a zone of reduced porosity which has been formed by the precipitation of calcite as overgrowths upon the matrix. Mineralised discontinuity surfaces provide routes for rapid migration of groundwater in both the saturated and unsaturated zones. There is no discernible relationship between the physical properties of discontinuities (i. e. orientation, dip, dip direction) and the occurrence of mineralisation. The distribution of discontinuities within the Chalk is not uniform. Clusters of similarly orientated discontinuities occur separated by less disturbed material, which causes the Chalk act as an anisotropic aquifer. Solution formed cavities have been observed at the point of intersection between discontinuities, or at the intersection of discontinuities with lithological heterogeneities. The cavities extend laterally along the line of intersection. These cavities allow rapid migration of groundwater within the saturated zone. Inclined solution cavities are formed where the discontinuities have differing orientations or where the lithological heterogeneities are dipping. Such cavities provide preferential routes of groundwater recharge through the unsaturated zone. The Chalk is a less effective aquifer at depth due to the decreased occurrence of solution enhanced discontinuities. The Chalk and Upper Greensand aquifers are not in hydraulic continuity in locations where the basal unit of the Lower Chalk, the Glauconitic Marl is present...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of magnetic recording, which {{is involved in}} most aspects of modem life from credit cards to video tapes, is evolving at an ever quickening pace. As the industry strives to produce greater recording capacity and increased information density the demands {{on the development of}} improved magnetic storage and recording head materials cannot always keep up with the pace of change. The materials being considered are not only required to have the desired magnetic properties but also to have the necessary corrosion resistance in the operating environment. It is often the latter which can limit the rate of development of new devices since many of the new materials considered for magnetic storage applications consist of very reactive metals with low corrosion resistances. In establishing how research on the corrosion properties of new magnetic materials should be approached, two different experimental routes are explored in this thesis. These studies were a) a combined electrochemical and surface analysis study and b) a novel 'in-situ' SIMS study. The electrochemical study proved to be a very valuable route in obtaining information on the corrosion properties of the magnetically-active alloy FeMn and such a study can be highly recommended for the application to other magnetic materials. The complete electrochemical properties (anodic and cathodic) of FeMn were determined. A region of passivity was revealed through the application of the very sensitive solution analysis technique of ICPMS. The passive layer is associated with a <b>manganese</b> <b>hydroxide</b> rich surface layer. Passivity in the alloy is very vulnerable to corrosion attack by sodium sulphate active ions. The influence of temperature and pH was investigated. Only under low values of pH with the conditions investigated was the corrosion attack increased compared to neutral conditions. The application of sodium chromate inhibitor was found to enhance the passive layer formed. Using the second route the application of a novel 'in-situ' SIMS technique to look at the oxidation properties of magnetic metals and alloys was explored.
