500|$|According to {{an article}} in the Springfield, Illinois State Journal-Register, as of August 2009 there was a {{shortage}} of film prints of The Hurt Locker, as well as other hit independent films such as Food, Inc. Distributors told theater owners {{that they would have to}} wait weeks or months past the initial U.S. release date to get the few available prints that were already in distribution. [...] "Sometimes the distributors goof up," [...] said a film buyer for one theater. [...] "They misjudge how wide they should go." [...] One theory is that the independent films have a hard time competing for screen space during the summer against blockbuster tent-pole films that take up as much as half the screens in any given city, flooding the United States market with thousands of prints. Theater owners have also complained about distributors [...] "bunching too many movies too close together". It is also thought that independent film distributors are trying to cut their losses on prints by recycling them. [...] Given the popularity of some of the films that are [...] "hard to come by", this strategy may be leaving box office <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
