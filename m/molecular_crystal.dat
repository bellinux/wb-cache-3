40|$|The {{understanding}} of the structure, stability, and response properties of <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals</b> at finite temperature and pressure is crucial for the field of crystal engineering and their application. For a long time, the field of crystal-structure prediction and modeling of <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals</b> {{has been dominated by}} classical mechanistic force-field methods. However, due to increasing computational power and the development of more sophisticated quantum-mechanical approximations, first-principles approaches based on density functional theory can now be applied to practically relevant <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals.</b> The broad transferability of first-principles methods is especially imperative for polymorphic <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals.</b> This review highlights the current status of modeling <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals</b> from first principles. We give an overview of current state-of-the-art approaches and discuss in detail the main challenges and necessary approximations. So far, the main focus in this field has been on calculating stabilities and structures without considering thermal contributions. We discuss techniques that allow one to include thermal effects at a first-principles level in the harmonic or quasi-harmonic approximation, and that are already applicable to realistic systems, or will be in the near future. Furthermore, this review also discusses how to calculate vibrational and elastic properties. Finally, we present a perspective on future uses of first-principles calculations for modeling <b>molecular</b> <b>crystals</b> and summarize the many remaining challenges in this field...|$|R

5000|$|The {{molecules}} in a <b>molecular</b> <b>crystal</b> are {{held together by}} van der Waals forces rather than chemical bonds. In principle, the closest that two atoms belonging to different molecules can approach one another is given by the sum of their van der Waals radii. By examining {{a large number of}} structures of molecular crystals, it is possible to find a minimum radius for each type of atom such that other non-bonded atoms do not encroach any closer. This approach was first used by Linus Pauling in his seminal work The Nature of the Chemical Bond. Bondi also conducted a study of this type, published in 1964, although he also considered other methods of determining the van der Waals radius in coming to his final estimates. Some of Bondi's figures are given in the table {{at the top of this}} article, and they remain the most widely used [...] "consensus" [...] values for the van der Waals radii of the elements. Rowland and Taylor re-examined these 1964 figures in the light of more recent crystallographic data: on the whole, the agreement was very good, although they recommend a value of 1.09 Å for the van der Waals radius of hydrogen as opposed to Bondi's 1.20 Å. A more recent analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database, carried out by Alvarez, provided a new set of values for 93 naturally occurring elements.|$|E
5000|$|Self-trapping of {{excitons}} {{is similar}} to forming strong-coupling polarons but with three essential differences. First, self-trapped exciton states are always of a small radius, {{of the order of}} lattice constant, due to their electric neutrality. Second, there exists a self-trapping barrier separating free and self-trapped states, hence, free excitons are metastable. Third, this barrier enables coexistence of free and self-trapped states of excitons. This means that spectral lines of free excitons and wide bands of self-trapped excitons can be seen simultaneously in absorption and luminescence spectra. It is interesting that while the self-trapped states are of lattice-spacing scale, the barrier has typically much larger scale. Indeed, its spatial scale is about [...] where [...] is effective mass of the exciton, [...] is the exciton-phonon coupling constant, and [...] is the characteristic frequency of optical phonons. Excitons are self-trapped when [...] and [...] are large, and then the spatial size of the barrier is large compared with the lattice spacing. Transforming a free exciton state into a self-trapped one proceeds as a collective tunneling of coupled exciton-lattice system (an instanton). Because [...] is large, tunneling can be described by a continuum theory. The height of the barrier [...] Because both [...] and [...] appear in the denominator of , the barriers are basically low. Therefore, free excitons can be seen in crystals with strong exciton-phonon coupling only in pure samples and at low temperatures. Coexistence of free and self-trapped excitons was observed in rare-gas solids, alkali-halides, and in <b>molecular</b> <b>crystal</b> of pyrene.|$|E
