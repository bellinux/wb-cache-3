40|$|Two-dimensional {{models of}} the read head are not {{suitable}} for simulating the replay of the extremely high density data {{that is expected to}} be achieved in hard drives using perpendicular recording. By matching a singular function approximation to the Fourier solution at the air-bearing surface (ABS), a three-dimensional analytic model of a shielded giant <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>head,</b> with side shields, for perpendicular replay is derived in this thesis. An explicit expression for the potential in the ABS is presented and parameters in that expression are accurately estimated for a range of practical head dimensions. Using only a few terms of this singular potential model, the vertical field is accurate to within 2 % of the sensor potential in the region of the medium for the majority of head dimensions suitable for magnetic recording. The expected increase in areal density in hard drives using perpendicular technology will require very narrow t racks which normally suffer from large inter-track interference (ITI) or crosstalk. This interference can corrupt the read data and reduce t he signal strength. Here, the effects of ITI across three tracks in a three-head system are modelled by applying the three-dimensional singular function model of the head field. The magnetisation patterns which cause the worst ITI are identified so that these codes can be prohibited. A coding constraints scheme, in which ITI is exploited to read from tracks which have widths that are just 70 % of the width of the head, is presented...|$|E

In this work, micromagnetic simulations {{were used to}} model magnetic phenomena such as magnetic nanoparticle behavior and magnetic recording processes. These simulations were used to optimize the heating properties of the nanoparticles {{as well as to}} design and simulate a new shingled recording head meant for recording densities in the multiple Tbit/inch 2 regime. Magnetic hyperthermia for treatment of tumors would benefit greatly from increased heating of the superparamagnetic particles, coupled with reduced incident electromagnetic wave power. Previous micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation with thermal fluctuations showed that the use of incident square waves greatly increases the normalized heat. Experimentally generating a square waveform may produce a trapezoidal waveform due to an inherent rise and fall time. It is found that the normalized heating power given by this wave shows a 30 % improvement over the sinusoidal waveform for an anisotropy distribution of 20 %. A static magnetic field applied perpendicular to the incident oscillating magnetic waveform was shown analytically to be able to improve the normalized heat. Previous simulations showed that the static field was indeed able to increase the effectiveness of a sinusoidal waveform. This work, using a square waveform, showed that the addition of the static field gives little added benefit to the square waveform’s effectiveness. A shingled recording head design is proposed that makes use of a saturation magnetization gradient to focus flux into the corner of the writing pole. This design yields field gradients of 800 Oe/nm and can write more than 2. 5 Tbits/Inch 2 of user data onto a 10 nm thick exchange couple composite (ECC) recording layer with 6 nm Voronoi grains. Maximum user densities were predicted to be over 4. 66 Tbits/Inch 2 with 8 nm grains and 12 Tbits/Inch 2 with 5 nm grains using a perfect read and write scheme at a 1 : 1 bit aspect ratio.

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to increasing the areal density of digital data stored on a magnetic recording medium, this thesis provides mathematical analyses of various magnetic recording heads. Each of the heads considered here is {{for use in a}} perpendicular recording system, writing to or reading from a multi-layer medium which includes a high magnetic permeability layer between the data storage layer and the substrate. The exact two-dimensional analysis is performed in each case by one of two methods: either Fourier analysis or conformal mapping. The types of heads analysed include conventional styles but particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the novel idea of potential grading across the pole pieces. Exact head fields are derived for thin film heads with both constant and linearly varying pole potentials, single pole heads with linearly and arbitrarily varying pole potentials and shielded <b>magnetoresistive</b> <b>heads,</b> all {{in the presence of a}} magnetic underlayer. These and other published solutions are used to derive output characteristics for perpendicular replay heads, which are compared with published theoretical and experimental results where possible. The Fourier solutions obtained are in the form of infinite series dependent on at least one set of coefficients which are determined by infinite systems of linear equations. Approximations to the potentials in the head face planes, independent of these coefficients, are derived from the exact Fourier solutions. The accuracy of these approximations is demonstrated when they are used to estimate the vertical field components and the spectral response functions. Heads with graded pole potentials are found to have more localised vertical field components than the corresponding constant potential heads.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{developments}} in the tunneling giant <b>magnetoresistive</b> (TGMR) <b>head</b> technology incorporating an MgO barrier, is currently the most promising candidate for replacing a GMR head. The TGMR head whose junction utilizes an MgO barrier yields a higher performance with a lower areal resistance (RA) value. However, as the areal density increases, the actual flying clearance of the head above the media surface during read/write operations is reduced to less than 10 nm. The head/disk interaction under such conditions results in a thermal response, which causes {{a shift in the}} baseline of the readback signal and exhibits bi-polar magneto-striction on opposing DC (positive and negative) backgrounds. This magneto-striction causes the thermal response to look different from the classical thermal response that could distort the readback signal to the extent of causing a sector read failure. In this paper, we investigate and characterize the thermal response induced by the head/disk interaction in the TGMR head with an MgO barrier that is currently used in perpendicular magnetic recording systems...|$|R

Conventional two-dimensional readout modeling techniques, using the reciprocity integral, rely {{on the assumption that}} the across-track medium magnetization is uniform under the giant <b>magnetoresistive</b> replay <b>head.</b> However, in the case of a geo-metrically constrained medium this is not the case. This paper in-vestigates the effect that the island geometry has on the characteris-tics of the replay signal in perpendicular patterned magnetic media storage through the extension of the reciprocity integral to three dimensions.

The great challenge for optimizing {{the performances of}} such devices is to control the EC strength in order to tune the anisotropy, which represents the key technological parameter for any applications of magnetic materials. In fact, the exchange interaction across the ferromagnetic(FM) /antiferromagnetic(AF) interface gives rise to an additional source of anisotropy (exchange anisotropy), determining {{the onset of the}} exchange bias effect and producing significant changes in the coercivity (HC). In this context, we have studied EC in continuous films with AF/FM and FM/AF configurations, grown by dc-magnetron sputtering in Ar atmosphere. As AF phase we have used Ir 25 Mn 75 (IrMn), whilst we have used Ni 80 Fe 20 (Py) as FM. All the samples have been deposited on a 5 nm thick Cu underlayer to favor a fcc (111) orientation and have been capped with a Cu overlayer (5 nm). We have studied and compared the effects of EC on the macroscopic magnetic properties (exchange fied Hex, HC and squareness) of a number of samples grown in different values of a magnetic field applied along the film plane (Hdep= 0, 200, 800 Oe) and having different thickness of the AF layer tAF (3, 6 and 10 nm; the thickness of FM was 5 nm in all the samples). Hysteresis loops have been measured by magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) and SQUID in the 5 - 300 K temperature range, after cooling in zero-field or in a field Hcool = 100 Oe from T = 400 K. At T = 300 K, the highest Hex (150 Oe) has been measured in the Si/Cu/NiFe/IrMn/Cu sample with tAF = 10 nm (HC 25 Oe); Hex goes to zero at TB 390 K. In the same configuration, for tAF = 6 nm, TB 370 K, (at T = 300 K, Hex 100 Oe, HC 60 Oe), whereas for tAF = 3 nm TB 230 K (at T = 300 K, HC 20 Oe).

40|$|A Read-While-Write (RWW) {{operation}} for tape and/or potentially disk applications {{is needed in}} the following three cases: 1. High reliability; 2. Data servo systems; 3. Buried servo systems. All these applications mean that the read (servo) head and write head are operative simultaneously. Consequently, RWW operation will require work to suppress the so-called crossfeed field radiation from the write head. Traditionally, write-read crossfeed has been reduced in conventional magnetic recording heads {{by a variety of}} screening methods, but the effectness of these methods is very limited. On the other hand, the early theoretical investigations of the crossfeed problem concentrating on the flux line pattern in front of a head structure based on a simplified model, may not be comprehensive. Today a growing number of magnetic recording equipment manufacturers employ thin-film technology to fabricate heads and thereby the size of the modern head is much smaller than in the past. The increasing use of thin-film metallic magnetic materials for heads, along with the appearance of other new technologies, such as the MR reproductive mode and keepered media, has stimulated the need for an increased understanding of the crossfeed problem by advanced analysis methods and a satisfactory practical solution to achieve the RWW operation. The work described in this thesis to suppress the crossfeed field involves both a novel reproductive mode of a Dual <b>Magnetoresistive</b> (DMR) <b>head,</b> which was originally designed to gain a large reproduce sensitivity at high linear recording densities exceeding 100 kFCI, playing the key role in suppressing the crossfeed (the corresponding signal-noise ratio is over 38 dB), and several other compensation schemes, giving further suppression. Advanced analytical and numerical methods of estimating crossfeed in single and multi track thin-film/MR heads under both DC and AC excitations can often help a head designer understand how the crossfeed field spreads and therefore how to suppress the crossfeed field from the standpoint of an overall head configuration. This work also assesses the scale of the crossfeed problem by making measurements on current and improved heads, thereby adapting the main contributors to crossfeed. The relevance of this work to the computer industry is clear for achieving simultaneous operation of the read head and write head, especially in a thin-film head assembly.

The results are consistent with the theoretical values obtained from the RKKY model of oscillatory exchange coupling. ^ We also present the results of specific ultracold neutron (UCN) storage experiments performed at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). We investigated certain anomalous features of UCN storage. The UCN were filled into a container whose walls were coated by a good neutron reflector (Fomblin grease). Then the neutrons were quickly removed by an absorber, until their residual density in the trap was measured to be negligible. Nevertheless, when the absorber was withdrawn, a measurable number of neutrons emerged from the trap. We have also found that application of a magnetic field gradient at the trap bottom as well as replacement of some Fomblin grease by liquid Fornblin oil gave rise to alterations of UCN count rate. These surprising phenomena are not well understood so far and require further experimental study. ...|$|R
