2500|$|Although Stax {{had also}} lost their most {{valuable}} artists, they recovered quickly. Johnnie Taylor gave Stax its first big post-Atlantic hit in 1968 with [...] "Who's Making Love", {{which became the}} label's best-selling single to that point. To begin rebuilding its catalog, Stax, under orders from Al Bell, released a whopping 27 albums (a Rufus Thomas album titled <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> Your Ticket Please? {{was to be the}} 28th album released by the Gulf+Western-owned Stax, but the album was never finished) and 30 singles in mid-1969. [...] Producer and songwriter Isaac Hayes stepped into the spotlight with Hot Buttered Soul. Originally seen just as a solo artistic project for Hayes to make up the numbers, it went on to sell over three million copies in 1969. By 1971, Hayes was established as the label's biggest star and was particularly noted for his best-selling soundtrack to the 1971 blaxploitation film Shaft. Hayes' recordings were among the releases on a third major Stax label, Enterprise, which had been founded in 1967.|$|E
