2500|$|The east shore {{along the}} Kenai Peninsula, {{from the mouth}} of Turnagain Arm nearly to Kachemak Bay, is low and {{comparatively}} flat, but is for the <b>most</b> part <b>heavily</b> wooded.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{almost an}} entire year's {{production}} {{was lost in}} {{one day in the}} Netherlands. The lack of sufficient numbers of aircraft <b>most</b> probably <b>heavily</b> influenced the decision not to invade England following the Battle of Britain.|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that less than a thousand plants are scattered over the mountains of Peloponnese. <b>Most</b> are <b>heavily</b> grazed by sheep and goats, {{but they do not}} eat the plant, so the populations have increased slowly.|$|R

Beginning in 1825, Alden was made head clerk of the Boston counting rooms and had charge {{of much of the}} firm's record-keeping from that time forward. Alden inherited the King Caesar House.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification. The areas <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.|$|E
5|$|Dublin is the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> touristed {{region and}} home to several {{of the most popular}} attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells.

He was helped by the 2010 round of redistricting, which shifted <b>most</b> of <b>heavily</b> Republican Warren County to the 1st.|$|R
25|$|Protestant cavalry {{was highly}} {{motivated}} and of good quality, {{many of the}} recruits {{were members of the}} German lesser nobility, and <b>most</b> were <b>heavily</b> armoured cuirassiers. The infantry was of much lesser material, poorly equipped, it had suffered the most in the march.|$|R

5|$|In May 2016, the MTA {{revealed}} {{plans to}} restore express {{service on the}} Culver Line between Jay Street and Church Avenue by Fall 2017. The Bergen Street lower level, however, will not be restored and reactivated for express service. This is {{in spite of the}} fact that the station is one of the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> used on the line.|$|E
5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages.

5|$|The Oslo Tunnel is the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> trafficked {{section of}} {{mainline}} railway in Norway. It has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour in each direction, and an applied capacity of 24 trains per hour in each direction. In rush hour, there {{are up to}} 20 trains operating through the tunnel, with a capacity of 8,000 passengers per hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} {{of the s}} {{underwent a}} massive development since the first Iowa-class ship was laid down in June 1940. Owing to the continual development of the weaponry aboard these battleships they remain the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> armed gunships the United States has ever put to sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The species has been {{captured}} from depths between 400 and 750 meters below sea level, and a 2009 study found the species <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> concentrated between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. V. togatas conservation status has not been assessed.|$|E

50|$|As with classic murder stories, {{the plot}} {{revolves}} around the characters, {{most of whom are}} either potential victims, or potential murderers. Most of the game characters are named after prominent figures of the time, such as Rudolph Valentino, W. C. Fields, Gloria Swanson, Clara Bow, and Clarence Darrow. <b>Most</b> are <b>heavily</b> based on well-used archetypes.|$|R
5000|$|Aubrites are {{typically}} light-colored, {{and with a}} brownish fusion crust. <b>Most</b> aubrites are <b>heavily</b> brecciated. It's often said that they look [...] "lunar" [...] in origin.|$|R
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from {{what was perceived as}} an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
50|$|The 2003 Texas {{redistricting}} shifted <b>most</b> of <b>heavily</b> Democratic Laredo, previously one of {{the bases}} of the 23rd District, into the already heavily Democratic 28th. Laredo is the base of former Texas Secretary of State Henry Cuellar, a somewhat more conservative Democrat than Rodriguez. A year earlier, Cuellar had given the 23rd's five-term Republican incumbent, Henry Bonilla, his closest race ever.|$|R
5000|$|Vendor dependency: Due to {{the general}} lack of {{knowledge}} related to industrial automation, <b>most</b> companies are <b>heavily</b> dependent on their OT vendors. This leads to vendor lock-in, eroding the ability to implement security fixes.|$|R
50|$|Critics gave Hatred {{negative}} acclaim, {{with some}} panning {{the game for}} its lack of variation. However, it was heavily praised by players {{and became one of}} the <b>most</b> purchased and <b>heavily</b> demanded games on the Steam service.|$|R
5|$|As of 2009, the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> trafficked {{segments}} of NY31 lie {{in and around}} the city of Rochester. The busiest of these, from Interstate590 (I-590) to NY65 in the eastern suburb of Brighton, carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles per day on average. Two other segments—between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY65 to French Road in Brighton and Pittsford—have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY31 in the Oneida County town of Vernon between the Vernon Downs racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.|$|E
5|$|Drivers from a {{total of}} 40 {{different}} countries have entered a World Championship race. The United Kingdom is the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> represented with 161 drivers. Second is the United States with 158; between 1950 and 1960 the American Indianapolis 500 race, rarely contested by drivers from outside the United States, {{was part of the}} World Drivers' Championship. Third is Italy with 99. Nine of these countries were represented in the very first race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, and the most recent newly represented country is Indonesia, with Rio Haryanto making his debut at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix. Statistics are accurate as of the 2017 Mexican Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Republicans are {{strongest in}} the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest {{in the eastern part of}} the state and Little Dixie, as well as the <b>most</b> <b>heavily</b> African American and inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a {{population}} of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also worth noting most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>most</b> of <b>heavily</b> secessionist Southern West Virginia, Summers County was powerfully Democratic for the century-and-a-third {{following}} West Virginia statehood. It voted Republican {{only in the}} landslide wins of 1920, 1928 (aided {{by powerful}} anti-Catholic sentiment against Al Smith), 1972 and 1984. Like all of West Virginia there has been since 2000 a dramatic swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party’s liberal views on social issues.|$|R
5000|$|Theodore Sturgeon praised Hard to Be a God as [...] "one of the <b>most</b> skillfully written, <b>heavily</b> freighted sf novels I {{have ever}} read," [...] saying [...] "The writing is well paced and the {{narrative}} is beautifully structured." ...|$|R
