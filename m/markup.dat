Trade integration appears to generally increase competitive pressure on <b>markups.</b> Industries exposed to more international competition experience a larger change in <b>markups</b> following integration into the European Union's Common Market.

40|$|Shifts in {{the extent}} of competition, which affect <b>markups,</b> are {{possible}} sources of aggregate fluctuations. <b>Markups</b> are countercyclical; during booms the economy operates more efficiently. In our benchmark model, <b>markups</b> correspond to the prices of differentiated inputs relative to that of undifferentiated final product. If nominal prices of differentiated goods are relatively sticky, unexpected inflation reduces <b>markups,</b> mimicking the effects of increased competition. Similar effects stem from reductions in <b>markups</b> of foreign intermediates and unexpected inflation abroad. The models imply that prices of less competitive goods are more countercyclical.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between consumer search costs, inflation, and firm <b>markups</b> in retail trade by employing actual measures of consumer search cost gathered by way of an online consumer survey. Consistent with theory, results indicate that <b>markups</b> can be higher if consumer search costs are higher.

This study's focus on retail trade allows for an evaluation of two competing hypotheses on the link between inflation and <b>markups.</b> One side of {{the argument is that}} consumer search costs are the link whereas the other side points to long-term relationships between sellers and buyers. Long-term seller/buyer relationships are rare in retail trade, thus the finding that consumer search costs do matter in retail trade implies that long-term seller/buyer relationship are not needed to link changes in inflation to changes in firm <b>markups.</b> Given this study's results, it is hard to justify studying how inflation impacts firm <b>markups</b> (and thus social welfare) without considering consumer search costs...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the impact of competition, both {{internal}} and external, and of the business cycle on monopolistic <b>markups</b> in the Polish economy. The results show that there are significant <b>markups</b> in several sectors of the economy which complies with earlier estimations by the authors.

In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between <b>markups</b> and the macroeconomic cycle which seems to confirm the conclusions from numerous theoretical macro and microeconomic models. The results also point to a positive but less clear correlation between the sectoral cycle and the level of <b>markups.</b> A different reaction of <b>markups</b> to the sectoral and macroeconomic cycles may result from a different nature of adjustments of businesses in reaction to exogenous shocks affecting either the sectoral or the macroeconomic environment of the enterprises. ...|$|R
