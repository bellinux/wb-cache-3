5|$|Roughly 20% of {{patients}} with SCSFLS exhibit features of <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> including tall stature, hollowed chest (pectus excavatum), joint hypermobility and arched palate. However these patients do not exhibit any other <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> presentations.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 {{has been}} implicated in several {{connective}} tissue disorders including <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
40|$|<b>Marfans</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{disorder}} of the connective tissue inherited as an autosomal dominant condition of variable expression and its classical form comprises of skeletal, cardiovascular and ocular abnormalities. It is attributed as a {{defect in the}} mutation in the fibrillin gene. The syndrome has {{a wide range of}} expression from mild to the severe forms. Sometimes the symptoms are so mild that only few of the symptoms occur. In most cases, the disease progresses with age and symptoms of <b>Marfans</b> <b>syndrome</b> become noticeable as changes in the connective tissue occur. Most of the reported cases so far are associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. We report a case of <b>Marfans</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with epilepsy.

40|$|Dural ectasia {{is one of}} {{the likely}} causes of {{incomplete}} or failed spinal anaesthesia. Its association with diseases like <b>Marfans</b> <b>syndrome,</b> neurofibromatosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, vertebral fracture, postopertative adhesions, trauma etc., is often overlooked as a reason for inadequate spinal anaesthesia. Greater than normal volume of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumber theca in dural ectasia is postulated to restrict the spread of intrathecally injected Local anaesthetic. Here, we report a case of failed spinal anaesthesia but successful epidural anaesthesia in later setting in a patient with dural ectasia...|$|R
40|$|Aneurysms of {{ascending}} aorta are rarely seen in pediatric age group. Only few cases with <b>Marfans</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{have been reported}} in the literature. Preferred treatment for these children has been the standard Bentall procedure (aortic root replacement with composite graft prosthesis). We report a 4 -year-old male child with huge aneurysm of {{ascending aorta}} and aortic root dilation with severe aortic regurgitation, having phenotypic features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I. He underwent Bentall procedure with a novel modification (medial trap-door technique for coronary reimplantation).

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is noted}} in 5–9% of {{individuals}} who suffer from an aortic dissection. In this subset, the incidence in young individuals is increased.

40|$|Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension is a {{syndrome}} involving reduced {{intracranial pressure}} secondary to a dural tear which occurs mostly due to connective tissue {{disorders such as}} <b>Marfans</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> and Ehler Danlos Syndrome. Patients with dural ectasias leading to CSF leakage into the subdural or epidural space classically present with orthostatic headaches and cranial nerve deficits mostly seen in cranial nerves V-VIII. Diagnosis of SIH is confirmed {{with the aid of}} neuroimaging modalities of which Cranial MR imaging is most widely used. SIH can be treated conservatively or with epidural blood patches which are now widely being used to repair dural tears, and their effectiveness is being recognized.

50|$|<b>Marfan</b> {{lipodystrophy}} <b>syndrome</b> (MFLS) {{has sometimes}} been confused with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, since the Marfanoid features are progressive and sometimes incomplete. MFLS is caused by mutations near the 3'-terminus of FBN1 that cause a deficiency of the protein hormone asprosin and progeroid-like symptoms with reduced subcutaneous white adipose tissue.|$|R
25|$|Dominant {{negative}} mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have {{an altered}} gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually {{result in an}} altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g., mutations in genes p53, ATM, CEBPA and PPARgamma). <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, located on chromosome 15, which encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix. <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Several {{inherited}} disorders {{have been}} linked to osteoporosis.

40|$|Spontaneous {{coronary}} artery dissection {{is a rather}} rare cause of myocardial infarction, chest pain, and sudden death. Since the condition was first described in 1931, fewer than 200 cases {{have been reported in}} the medical literature. There are currently no known direct causes of this condition, although some correlations have been noted. Many patients are women in the peripartum period or of childbearing age, with few or no risk factors for {{coronary artery}} disease. Other associations include contraceptive use and connective-tissue disorders, Ehlers-Danlos and <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndromes,</b> and polyarteritis nodosa. Most of the reported dissections have occurred in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Herein, we report the case of a 36 -year-old woman who presented at our institution with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to a spontaneous dissection of the right coronary artery. Thrombectomy and stenting resolved the occlusion of the artery, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on medical therapy. We discuss the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of this rare and often fatal condition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAneurysms {{affecting}} the aorta {{are a common}} condition associated with high mortality {{as a result of}} aortic dissection or rupture. Investigations of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in syndromic types of thoracic aortic aneurysms, such as <b>Marfan</b> and Loeys-Dietz <b>syndromes,</b> have revealed an important contribution of disturbed transforming growth factor (TGF) -β signaling. ObjectivesThis study sought to discover a novel gene causing syndromic aortic aneurysms in order to unravel the underlying pathogenesis. MethodsWe combined genome-wide linkage analysis, exome sequencing, and candidate gene Sanger sequencing in a total of 470 index cases with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Extensive cardiological examination, including physical examination, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echocardiography was performed. In adults, imaging of the entire aorta using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was done. ResultsHere, we report on 43 patients from 11 families with syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysms caused by TGFB 3 mutations. We demonstrate that TGFB 3 mutations are associated with significant cardiovascular involvement, including thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysm and dissection, and mitral valve disease. Other systemic features overlap clinically with Loeys-Dietz, Shprintzen-Goldberg, and <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndromes,</b> including cleft palate, bifid uvula, skeletal overgrowth, cervical spine instability and clubfoot deformity. In line with previous observations in aortic wall tissues of patients with mutations in effectors of TGF-β signaling (TGFBR 1 / 2, SMAD 3, and TGFB 2), we confirm a paradoxical up-regulation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling in association with up-regulation of the expression of TGF-β ligands. ConclusionsOur findings emphasize the broad clinical variability associated with TGFB 3 mutations and highlight the importance of early recognition of the disease because of high cardiovascular risk...|$|R

25|$|The musical {{was first}} {{seen in a}} {{workshop}} production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1993.

40|$|There are {{intimate}} {{interrelations between}} various elements of connective tissue, viz. collagen, elastin, and glycoproteins. It is not unexpected that <b>Marfan</b> and Ehlers-Danlos <b>syndromes</b> share common features. The condition is labelled as Marfanoid hypermobility syndrome.

50|$|An aortic {{aneurysm}} can {{occur as a}} result of trauma, infection, or, most commonly, from an intrinsic abnormality in the elastin and collagen components of the aortic wall. While definite genetic abnormalities were identified in true genetic <b>syndromes</b> (<b>Marfan,</b> Elher-Danlos and others) associated with {{aortic aneurysm}}s, both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms demonstrate a strong genetic component in their aetiology.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of causes, [...] Aneurysms in {{patients}} younger than 40 usually involve the ascending aorta due to a weakening of the aortic wall associated with connective tissue disorders like the <b>Marfan</b> and Ehler-Danlos <b>syndromes</b> or congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Younger patients may develop aortic aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta after an aortic dissection. It can also be caused by blunt injury.|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} most cases is unknown but {{believed}} to involve {{a combination of}} genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include other affected family members. It can also occur due to another condition such as muscles spasms, cerebral palsy, <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and tumors such as neurofibromatosis. Diagnosis is confirmed with plain X-rays. Scoliosis is typically classified as either structural in which the curve is fixed or functional in which the underlying spine is normal.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 1996, {{after the}} musical's final dress {{rehearsal}} before its off-Broadway opening, Larson {{had his first}} (and only) newspaper interview with music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see Rent's success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm (believed to have resulted from <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome)</b> {{in the early morning}} of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of Rent became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} is {{more common}} in those with a history of high blood pressure, a number of connective tissue diseases that affect blood vessel wall strength such as <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a bicuspid aortic valve, and previous heart surgery. Major trauma, smoking, cocaine use, pregnancy, a thoracic aortic aneurysm, inflammation of arteries, and abnormal lipid levels are also associated with an increased risk. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms with medical imaging such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound used to confirm and further evaluate the dissection. The two main types are Stanford type A which involves {{the first part of the}} aorta and type B which does not.|$|E
40|$|Transposition {{of great}} arteries (TGA) {{is one of}} the most common and severe {{congenital}} heart diseases (CHD). It is also one of the most mysterious CHD because it has no precedent in phylogenetic and ontogenetic development, it does not represent an alternative physiological model of blood circulation and its etiology and morphogenesis are still largely unknown. However, recent epidemiologic, experimental and genetic data suggest new insights into the pathogenesis. TGA is very rarely associated with the most frequent genetic syndromes, such as Turner, Noonan, Williams or <b>Marfan</b> <b>syndromes,</b> and in Down syndrome, it is virtually absent. The only genetic syndrome with a strong relation with TGA is Heterotaxy. Moreover, TGA is rather frequent in cases of isolated dextrocardia with situs solitus, showing link with defect of visceral situs. In lateralization defects TGA is frequently associated with asplenia syndrome. Nowadays, the most reliable method to induce TGA consists in treating pregnant mice with retinoic acid or with retinoic acid inhibitors. Following such treatment not only cases of TGA with d-ventricular loop have been registered, but also some cases of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (CCTGA). In another experiment, the embryos of mice treated with retinoic acid in day 6. 5 presented Heterotaxy, suggesting a relationship among these morphologically different CHD. In some families, beside TGA cases, there were first-degree relatives with CCTGA. This data suggest that monogenic inheritance with a variable phenotypic expression could explain the familial aggregation of TGA and CCTGA. In some of these families we previously found multiple mutations in laterality genes including Nodal and ZIC 3, confirming a pathogenetic relation between TGA and Heterotaxy. These overall data suggest to include TGA in the pathogenetic group of laterality defects instead of conotruncal abnormalities due to ectomesenchymal tissue migration...|$|R
