50|$|The {{majority}} of retail markets are {{operated by the}} public sector and administered by local governments. A small number are operated by private groups or individuals.

A voluntary scheme has been set up by The Market People, backed by the National Association of British <b>Market</b> <b>Authorities</b> (NABMA) to address this problem. It provides consumers with traceability of traders and goods as well as the ability to rate and contact the traders. A MarketPASS is issued to an operator or trader, once they have provided proof of identity, insurance and, where required, a hygiene certificate.|$|E
