40|$|A {{document}} discusses {{an innovation}} designed to effectively monitor dielectric charging in spacecraft components {{to measure the}} potential for discharge {{in order to prevent}} damage from internal electrostatic discharge (IESD). High-energy electrons penetrate the structural materials and shielding of a spacecraft and then stop inside dielectrics and keep accumulating. Those deposited charges generate an electric field. If the electric field becomes higher than the breakdown threshold (approx. = 2 x 10 (exp 5) V/cm), discharge occurs. This monitor measures potentials as a function of dielectric depth. Differentiation of potential with respect to the depth yields electric field. Direct measurement of the depth profile of the potential in a dielectric makes real-time electronic field evaluation possible without simulations. The IESDM has been designed to emulate a <b>multi-layer</b> <b>circuit</b> board, to insert very thin metallic layers between the dielectric layers. The conductors serve as diagnostic monitoring locations to measure the deposited electron-charge and the charge dynamics.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of RF MEMS switches with novel materials and micromachining techniques for the RF and microwave applications. To enable the integration of RF and microwave components on CMOS grade silicon, finite ground coplanar waveguide transmission line on CMOS grade silicon wafer were first studied using micromachining techniques. In addition, several RF MEMS capacitive switches were developed with novel materials. A novel approach for fabricating low cost capacitive RF MEMS switches using directly photo-definable high dielectric constant metal oxides was developed, these switches exhibited significantly higher isolation and load capacitances as compared to comparable switches fabricated using a simple silicon nitride dielectric. The second RF MEMS switch developed is on a low cost, flexible liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. Its very low water absorption (0. 04 %), low dielectric loss and <b>multi-layer</b> <b>circuit</b> capability make it very appealing for RF Systems-On-a-Package (SOP). Also, a tunable RF MEMS switch on a sapphire substrate with BST as dielectric material was developed, the BST has a very high dielectric constant (> 300) making it very appealing for RF MEMS capacitive switches. The tunable dielectric constant of BST provides a possibility of making linearly tunable MEMS capacitor-switches. For the first time a capacitive tunable RF MEMS switch with a BST dielectric and its characterization and properties up to 40 GHz was presented. Dielectric charging is the main reliability issue for MEMS switch, temperature study of dielectric polarization effect of RF MEMS was investigated in this dissertation. Finally, integration of two reconfigurable RF circuits with RF MEMS switches were discussed, the first one is a reconfigurable dual frequency (14 GHz and 35 GHz) antenna with double polarization using RF MEMS switches on a multi-layer LCP substrate; and the second one is a center frequency and bandwidth tunable filter with BST capacitors and RF MEMS switches on sapphire substrate.

A {{manufacturing}} process with {{the capability to}} integrate electronics into 3 D structures is of great importance {{to the development of}} next-generation miniaturised devices. In this study, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) was used to process copper/high-density-polyethylene (HDPE) powder mixtures to build conductive tracks in a 3 D circuit system. The effects of copper/HDPE volume ratio, laser input power and scanning speed on the resistivity of CO 2 laser processed tracks were investigated. The resistivity of the tracks decreased from 26. 6 ± 0. 6 × 10 − 4 Ωcm to 1. 9 ± 0. 1 × 10 − 4 Ωcm as the copper volume ratio increased from 30 % to 60 %. However, further increasing the copper ratio to 100 % resulted in poor conductivity. The lowest resistivity was achieved with an input power of 20 W and scanning speed of 80 mm/s. Additionally, processing using single-track-scanning and raster-scanning programs was compared; the overall energy distribution on the surface was more uniform using a raster-scanning program, which further reduced the resistivity to 0. 35 ± 0. 04 × 10 − 4 Ωcm. Based on the results, a 3 D <b>multi-layered</b> <b>circuit</b> system was manufactured with the HDPE as the substrate/matrix material and copper/HDPE mixture as the conductive-track material.
