Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same <b>month</b> <b>when</b> he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E

The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915.

5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a <b>month</b> <b>when</b> he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

At this time the Navy took over the task of providing guards for ships in harbour and communications facilities, thus allowing for many of the militia troops to be released for further training, and as such it was decided to increase the period of camp training for the militia from eight days to 24.|$|E

The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, Chotiner {{resigned}} from his White House job {{and returned to}} the private practice of law. He represented former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who had been informally promised early parole from his jury tampering sentence. Chotiner wrote to Haldeman in November 1971, noting that no action on Hoffa's release seemed to be taking place, and President Nixon granted Hoffa clemency later that <b>month.</b> <b>When</b> Chotiner's role became public in 1973, he stated that he was proud of his actions on behalf of Hoffa. Chotiner also lobbied the White House on behalf of milk producers, who were seeking increased price supports and who were major contributors to the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence offered Segrè {{a job as}} a {{research}} assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element—for US$300 a month for six months. However, when Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he reduced Segrè's salary to US$116 a <b>month.</b> <b>When</b> the regents of the University of California wanted to terminate Segré's employment owing to his foreign nationality, Lawrence managed to retain Segré by hiring him as a part-time lecturer paid by the Rockefeller Foundation. Similar arrangements were made to retain his doctoral students Chien-Shiung Wu (a Chinese national) and Kenneth Ross MacKenzie (a Canadian national) when they graduated.|$|E

5|$|U-16 {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the <b>month.</b> <b>When</b> completed, the {{submarine}} was broken down into sections, loaded onto railcars, and shipped on 20 August to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pula. After completing the eight-day journey, the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of {{how long it took}} for U-16s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine , shipped to Pula from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-16 was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 29 September.|$|E
5|$|Both fighters' {{victories}} on April 12 {{cleared the}} way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, marking the first time Cotto headlined a Las Vegas card. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. The Las Vegas notion gained momentum in the previous <b>month</b> <b>when</b> the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8ounce (227g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10ounce (284g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito likely would have refused to fight in Las Vegas without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E

5|$|Norway had {{experienced}} {{a long period of}} peace during the reign of Magnus' father, Olaf. Magnus may have been present when Olaf died in Rånrike, Båhuslen (southeastern Norway) in September 1093 and was probably proclaimed king at the Borgarting, the thing (assembly) of the adjacent region of Viken later that <b>month.</b> <b>When</b> Magnus became king, he already had a network of support among the Norwegian aristocracy. Although sources are unclear about the first year of his reign, it is apparent that Magnus' focus was on the west (towards the British Isles). Since conditions were chaotic in Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles since the death of Thorfinn the Mighty, this provided Magnus an opportunity to intervene in local power struggles. According to some accounts, he made his first expedition west in 1093–94 (or 1091–92), helping Scottish king Donald Bane to conquer Edinburgh and the Scottish throne and possibly gaining control of the Southern Isles (Suðreyjar) in return. It is unclear if this early expedition took place, since it is not directly referenced in early reliable sources or the sagas.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1913 Dyer faced Jack Delaney for {{the vacant}} Wales Area Welterweight title, despite Delaney being English. The fight was staged at the Skating Rink on Westgate Street in Cardiff and was {{scheduled}} for 20 rounds. The fight went the distance and Dyer was awarded the bout on points decision, making him the Welsh welterweight champion. He held the title for just over a <b>month</b> <b>when</b> a rematch for the title ended in victory for Delaney. Despite the loss, a win over Gus Platts—who would later become British and European middleweight champion—in October resulted in Dyer being touted {{as one of the}} preferred challengers to the British welterweight champion Johnny Summers. Summers though had travelled to Australia to extend his boxing campaign, and in the spring of 1914 Dyer decided to follow him abroad to challenge for his title. Dyer stopped off en route in South Africa to play music halls in a bid to help pay his fares. Dyer entertained with a mixture of songs and shadow boxing, and challenged all-comers to fight with him {{at the end of the}} show. Unfortunately for Dyer, by the time he reached Australia, Summers had already returned to Britain.|$|E

After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie {{returned}} in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him. The adoption process was halted the following <b>month</b> <b>when</b> the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003). Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone, and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.|$|E
