5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a <b>manslaughter</b> investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with involuntary <b>manslaughter</b> in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{negligence}} <b>manslaughter</b> {{requires a}} much greater level of wrongdoing that the civil tort of negligence.|$|E

Appearances at previous hearings had been made via videolink from prison.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a <b>manslaughter</b> plea {{on the grounds that they}} had agreed to a suicide pact. The {{prosecution}} did not accept the <b>manslaughter</b> plea and pursued a trial for the murder of Danielle. However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also pleaded guilty to stealing £84,000 from clients.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to <b>manslaughter.</b> What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to <b>manslaughter</b> by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

After his {{dismissal}} by the CNR, Atherton was staying with his parents at Zealandia, where his father was CNR station agent. The <b>manslaughter</b> charge concerned the death of Henry Proskunik, fireman aboard the troop train. Bail was set at $5,000, and Magistrate P.J. Moran required any sureties to appear before him, {{making it difficult for}} Atherton's connections in Saskatchewan to obtain his release. Atherton was released from custody on January 24, as Prince George furniture store owner Alex Moffat and local CNR employee William Reynolds each posted sureties valued at $2,500.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, five {{managers}} and two companies – Network Rail (as successors of Railtrack) and {{the division of}} Balfour Beatty that maintained the track – were charged with <b>manslaughter</b> and breach of health and safety charges {{in connection with the}} accident.

40|$|This study uses {{data from}} the California Linked Homicide File {{as a basis for}} {{evaluating}} the validity and reliability of homicide data. Case-by-case comparisons of variables reported by both agencies indicate that agreement between law enforcement and vital statistics data is highest with classifying homicides and victim gender and race and low-est with classifying victim age, <b>manslaughters,</b> and police justifiable homicides. The findings from a multilevel analysis examining what types of cases are unable to be linked over the two data-collection systems reveal that homicides involving Hispanic victims, weapons other than handguns, and family members other than intimate partners and homicides involving felonies, other nonfelonies, and negligent <b>manslaughters</b> have a greater likelihood of not being matched across the agencies. Death investigation systems that use medical examiners also decrease matching. The need for qualitative research examining how classification decisions are made by police and medical examiners or coroners is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Murders Abroad Act 1817 had {{previously}} given Lachlan Macquarie, the Governor of New South Wales, an increased legal authority over New Zealand and murders or <b>manslaughters</b> could {{be tried in}} an admiralty court just {{as if they had}} been committed at sea. The New South Wales Act 1823 extended the jurisdiction to include lesser crimes committed in New Zealand.|$|R

Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of <b>manslaughter</b> and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of <b>manslaughter</b> were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E

[...] But {{the aftermath of}} the uprising in no way satisfied England's poor. While Henry VI showed clemency to his principal rival Richard Duke of York during the Wars of the Roses, he was merciless to Jack Cade and his followers.|$|R
