40|$|Abstract—Numerous retinopathies {{are related}} to the {{dysfunction}} of retinal vasculature, especially micro-vessels. Extensive research in ophthalmology has singled out critical roles of vascular morphology, and the functional dynamics of blood flow in diseases. Advances in angiography has yielded a myriad of applications for computational methods that design efficient tools to complement retinal imaging and microscopy in analytic ophthalmology. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical approach for the design of quantitative tools that enable researchers, as well as automated vision-based systems, to perform pattern recognition, and feature extraction in retinal vasculature. The present feasibility-stage implementation of these new algorithms demonstrates the power and versatility of the set of tools we provide for the detection of <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology,</b> as well as the theoretical study of retinal neurovasculature anatomy whe...|$|E

Data Sources: Data cited in this review were obtained mainly from PubMed in English up to 2015, with keywords “molecular”, “genetics”, “GBM”, “isocitrate dehydrogenase”, “telomerase reverse transcriptase”, “epidermal growth factor receptor”, “PTPRZ 1 -MET”, and “clinical treatment”. Study Selection: Articles regarding the <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology</b> of GBM, the epidemiology of GBM, genetic alteration of GBM, {{and the development of}} treatment for GBM patients were identified, retrieved, and reviewed. Results: There is a large amount of data supporting the view that these recurrent genetic aberrations occur in a specific context of cellular origin, co-oncogenic hits and are present in distinct patient populations. Primary and secondary GBMs are distinct disease entities that affect different age groups of patients and develop through distinct genetic aberrations. These differences are important, especially because they may affect sensitivity to radio- and chemo-therapy and should thus be considered in the identification of targets for novel therapeutic approaches.

40|$|Mutations in the {{dystrophin}} gene {{result in}} Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Dystrophin is a multidomain protein that functions {{to stabilize the}} sarcolemmal membrane during muscle contraction. The central rod domain has been proposed {{to act as a}} shock absorber, as a force transducer or as a spacer separating important N- and C-terminal domains that interact with actin and the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC). Structure/function studies demonstrated that deletion of large portions of the rod domain can result in the production of smaller, yet highly functional, dystrophin proteins. In a dramatic example, a ‘microdystrophin’ transgene containing only four dystrophin spectrin-like repeats resulted in complete correction of most of the symptoms associated with dystrophy in the mdx mouse model for DMD. Dystrophin shares considerable homology with the multidomain, actin-crosslinking protein a-actinin. To explore the hypothesis that the dystrophin rod domain acts as a spacer region, a chimeric micro-dystrophin transgene containing the four-repeat rod domain of a-actinin- 2 was expressed in mdx mice. This chimeric transgene was incapable of correcting the <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology</b> of the mdx mouse, but still functioned to assemble the DGC at the membrane and provided some protection from contraction-induced injury. These data demonstrated that different spectrin-like repeats are not equivalent, and reinforced the suggestion that the dystrophin rod domain is not merely a spacer but likely contributes an important mechanical role to overall dystrophin function...|$|E

The author has been interested in the various components of so called 2 ̆ 2 strokes 2 ̆ 2, and strongly stresses the fact that the <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology</b> of this illness must be solved before one tackles it from a physiological aspect. Not all patients presenting clinical signs and symptoms of strokes however, showed a definite change on roentogenological angiography.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of Achilles tendinopathy {{is high and}} underlying etiology as well as biochemical and <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology</b> associated with the disease is largely unknown. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe biochemical and morphological differences in chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The expressions of growth factors, inflammatory mediators and tendon morphology were determined in both chronically diseased and healthy tendon parts. Methods Thirty Achilles tendinopathy patients were randomized to an expression-study (n = 16) or a structural-study (n = 14). Biopsies from two areas in the Achilles tendon were taken and structural parameters: fibril density, fibril size, volume fraction of cells and the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of cells were determined. Further gene expressions of various genes were analyzed. Results Significantly smaller collagen fibrils and a higher volume fraction of cells were observed in the tendinopathic region of the tendon. Markers for collagen and its synthesis collagen 1, collagen 3, fibronectin, tenascin-c, transforming growth factor-β fibromodulin, and markers of collagen breakdown matrix metalloproteinase- 2, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 and metallopeptidase inhibitor- 2 were significantly increased in the tendinopathic region. No altered expressions of markers for fibrillogenesis, inflammation or wound healing were observed. Conclusion The present study indicates that an increased expression of factors stimulating the turnover of connective tissue is present in the diseased part of tendinopathic tendons, associated with an increased number of cells in the injured area as well as an increased number of smaller and thinner fibrils in the diseased tendon region. As no fibrillogenesis, inflammation or wound healing could be detected, the present data supports the notion that tendinopathy is an ongoing degenerative process.

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) are {{significant}} causes of adult {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Though these conditions are common, the mechanisms of pathogenesis in kidney disease are poorly understood. Genetic predisposition {{has been established in}} the African American population; however this does not explain the ubiquity of CKD in the United States and abroad. Diabetes and hypertension are the two most frequently occurring co-morbidities in kidney disease and both have been identified as putative sources of injury to the delicate filtering structures of the kidney. Furthermore, the intrinsic functional relationship between the cardiovascular and renal organ systems adds to the plausibility of a hemodynamic cause. In light of this knowledge, we aim to explore the roles of genetic predisposition and hypertension in the pathogenesis and progression of CKD. The filtering apparatus of the kidney, the glomerulus, is a looping tuft of capillaries specialized to allow the passage of water and certain substances from the blood while restricting others. Glomeruli at the corticomedullary boundary of the kidney experience blood pressures closer to those in systemic arterioles and are subject to similar hemodynamic stresses. To evaluate the role of hypertension in CKD, we employed a well-known model of hypertensive kidney disease in mice involving uninephrectomy (UNX), subcutaneous implantation of a timed-release pellet containing the active aldosterone precursor deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA), and a high-salt diet. Given the role of heritability in human CKD pathogenesis, we applied the DOCA-UNX model in two strains of mice with differing susceptibility to kidney damage, the 129 S 6 and C 57 BL/ 6 strains, to evaluate the effects of genetic predisposition. Mice were subjected to varying lengths of hypertension exposure and their kidneys were subsequently examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultrastructural lesions of glomeruli were evaluated by a renal pathologist and assigned subjective pathology scores based on the extent and severity of involvement. We hypothesized that certain glomerular lesions, particularly those involving the podocytes of the visceral epithelium, would increase in severity in mice with heritable susceptibility (129 S 6) as well as those with longer exposure to glomerular hypertension. Our observations demonstrate these hypotheses are partially correct. By TEM histopathology, mouse strain was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the severity of certain epithelial lesions while duration of hypertension had a significant effect on the overall <b>morphological</b> <b>pathology</b> of the podocytes, glomerular basement membrane, and glomerulus as a whole. These results provide a promising foundation for further investigation of the pathogenesis of CKD in mice...|$|E

To use single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) as a &ldquo;molecular heater&rdquo; for hyperthermia therapy in cancer, stable dispersibility and smart-delivery potential will be needed, {{as well as}} lack of toxicity. This paper reports the preparation of a model complex comprising DNA-treated SWNT and anti-human IgG antibody and the specific binding ability of this model complex with the targeted protein, ie, human IgG. Treatment with double-stranded DNA enabled stable dispersibility of a complex composed of SWNT and the antibody under physiological conditions. Quartz crystal microbalance results suggest that there was one immobilized IgG molecule to every 21, 700 carbon atoms in the complex containing DNA-treated SWNT and the antibody. The DNA-SWNT antibody complex showed good selectivity for binding to the targeted protein.

Double-pulsed-field-gradient MR methods provide a means for obtaining microstructural information such as compartment shape and microscopic anisotropies even in scenarios where macroscopic organization is absent. Here, we apply angular double-pulsed-gradient-spin-echo MRI in the rat brain both ex vivo and in vivo for the first time. Robust angular dependencies are detected in the brain at long mixing time (tm). In many pixels, the oscillations seem to originate from residual directors in randomly oriented media, i. e., from residual ensemble anisotropy, as corroborated by quantitative simulations. We then developed an analysis scheme that enables one to map of structural indices such as apparent eccentricity (aE) and residual phase (φ) that enables characterization of the rat brain in general, and especially the rat gray matter.

This exothermic generation {{can be used as}} a possible heating source for hyperthermia therapy. The current study reports the dispersible and exothermic properties with NIR irradiation for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) treated with a strong acid (acid-treated SWNTs), and the SWNTs further functionalized with double-stranded DNA (DNA-functionalized SWNTs: DNA-SWNTs). DNA-SWNTs significantly improved the dispersibility of SWNTs when compared with the acid-treated SWNTs. The binding ratio of the acid-treated SWNT and DNA was calculated to be 3. 1 (DNA/SWNTs) from the phosphorous content in the DNA-SWNT. This interaction of the SWNTs and DNA would contribute to the stable dispersion of the DNA-SWNTs in a culture medium. With NIR irradiation by a halogen lamp light source, the acid-treated SWNTs and the DNA-SWNTs showed strong heat evolution in vitro (in a culture medium) and in vivo (in the subcutaneous tissue of a mouse) condition without any invasive effect on the non-SWNT area.

Despite relatively good long-term survival, these patients often suffer from cyanosis and multisystemic dysfunction, where pulmonary artery thrombosis can be a potentially fatal complication. Together with bleeding {{these are the most}} frequent causes of non-cardiac death in patients with severe PAH due to CHD. Patients and methodsProspective study of 40 patients with severe PAH due to CHD (28 female/ 12 male, median age 41. 5 years) was performed, with the aim to analyze the presence of pulmonary artery thrombosis and correlating anatomical and laboratory risk factors. ResultsPrevious thrombosis and/or thromboembolic event was found in 7 patients (17. 5 %). Significant differences in cyanotic vs non-cyanotic patients were in red blood count parameters: median hemoglobin level 195 vs 141 (p 40 mm in female and > 45 mm in male) was found in 19 patients (51. 4 %).

The aim of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} this matter for the first time. Methods 100 subjects (age 70 [*]±[*] 10 yrs, 46 female), n[*]=[*] 51 with clinically defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n[*]=[*] 44 with possible/probable AD dementia, and n[*]=[*] 5 with frontotemporal lobe degeneration, underwent simultaneous [18 F]florbetaben or [11 C]PIB PET/MRI (3 Tesla Siemens mMR). Brain amyloid load, mesial temporal lobe atrophy (MTLA) by means of the Scheltens scale, and other <b>morphological</b> brain <b>pathologies</b> were scored by respective experts. The patients/caregivers as well as the referrers were asked to assess on a five-point scale the convenience related to the one-stop-shop PET and MRI approach. Results In three subjects, MRI revealed temporal lobe abnormalities other than MTLA. According to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association classification, the combined amyloid-beta PET/MRI evaluation resulted in 31 %, 45 %, and 24 % of the MCI subjects being categorized as “MCI-unlikely due to AD”, “MCI due to AD-intermediate likelihood”, and “MCI due to AD-high likelihood”, respectively. 50 % of the probable AD dementia patients were categorized as “High level of evidence of AD pathophysiological process”, and 56 % of the possible AD dementia patients as “Possible AD dementia - with evidence of AD pathophysiological process”. With regard to the International Working Group 2 classification, 36 subjects had both positive diagnostic and progression biomarkers. The patient/caregiver survey revealed a gain of convenience in 88 % of responders as compared to a theoretically separate PET and MR imaging. In the referrer survey, an influence of the combined amyloid-beta PET/MRI on the final diagnosis was reported by 82 % of responders, with a referrer acceptance score of 3. 7 [*]±[*] 1. 0 on a 5 -point scale.

Surgical techniques have evolved to utilise arthroscopic femoral osteoplasty to address potential <b>morphological</b> contributors to <b>pathology.</b> Purpose Investigate pain and function outcomes fol-lowing hip arthroscopy with and without femoral osteo-plasty in individuals with intra-articular hip pathology. Study design Systematic review. Methods A comprehensive search strategy identi-fi ed studies that evaluated the outcome over at least 3 months following arthroscopy for intra-articular hip pathology, using patient-reported outcomes of pain and/or function. Methodological quality was evaluated (Downs and Black scale), and effect sizes calculated when suffi cient data were available. Results Twenty-nine studies of moderate methodologi-cal quality were included. Of 16 studies investigating arthroscopy alone, two studies showed large effects (3. 12 – 5. 46) at 1 – 2 years. Pain reduction and functional improvement (median 47 %) were consistently reported by the remaining 14 studies up to 10 years postsurgery. Of 15 studies investigating arthroscopy with osteoplasty, nine papers showed mostly large effects (0. 78 – 2. 93) over 6 – 28 months. Adverse events were minimal (7 % of participants, 12 studies, predominantly transient neuro-praxia (83 %)).

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} uterine smooth muscle tumors with uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) is often challenging, and genomic data on these lesions {{as well as on}} uterine smooth muscle lesions are limited. We tested the hypothesis that genomic profile determination by array-CGH could split STUMP into a benign group with scarce chromosomal alterations akin to leiomyoma and a malignant group with high chromosomal instability akin to leiomyosarcoma. Array-CGH genomic profile analysis was conducted for a series of 29 cases of uterine STUMP. A group of ten uterine leiomyomas and ten uterine leiomyosarcomas served as controls. The mean age was 50 years (range, 24 - 85) and the follow-up ranged from 12 to 156 months (average 70 months). Since STUMP is a heterogenous group of tumors with genomic profiles that can harbor few to many chromosomal alterations, we compared genomic indices in leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas and set a genomic index= 10 threshold. Tumors with a genomic index 10 represented STUMPs with recurrences and unfavorable outcomes. Hence, the genomic index threshold splits the STUMP category into two groups of tumors with different outcomes: a group comparable to leiomyomas and another similar to leiomyosarcomas, but more indolent. In our STUMP series, genomic analysis by array-CGH is an innovative diagnostic tool for problematic smooth muscle uterine lesions, complementary to the morphological evaluation approach.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of the autosomal recessive form of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) with a locus on chromosome 5 q 23 - 33 in six non-related European families, to refine gene mapping, and to define the disease phenotype.  METHODS—In an Algerian patient with autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT mapped to chromosome 5 q 23 -q 33 the same unique nerve pathology was established as previously described in families with a special form of autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT. Subsequently, the DNA of patients with this phenotype was tested from five Dutch families and one Turkish family for the 5 q 23 -q 33 locus.  RESULTS—These patients and the Algerian families showed a similar and highly typical combination of clinical and morphological features, suggesting a common genetic defect. A complete cosegregation for markers D 5 S 413, D 5 S 434, D 5 S 636, and D 5 S 410 {{was found in the}} families. Haplotype construction located the gene to a 7 cM region between D 5 S 643 and D 5 S 670. In the present Dutch families linkage disequilibrium could be shown for various risk alleles and haplotypes indicating that most of these families may have inherited the underlying genetic defect form a common distant ancestor.  CONCLUSIONS—This study refines the gene localisation of autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT, mapping to chromosome 5 q 23 - 33 and defines the phenotype characterised by a precocious and rapidly progressive scoliosis in combination with a relatively mild neuropathy and a unique <b>pathology.</b> <b>Morphological</b> alterations in Schwann cells of the myelinated and unmyelinated type suggest the involvement of a protein present in both Schwann cell types or an extracellular matrix protein rather than a myelin protein. The combination of pathological features possibly discerns autosomal recessive demyelinating CMT with a gene locus on chromosome 5 q 23 - 33 from other demyelinating forms of CMT disease. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of the atypical form of myxomatosis struck a rabbit farm in Hungary. The animals had previously been vaccinated with a vaccine containing Shope rabbit fibroma virus strain. The disease appeared in winter when the presence of mosquitoes and fleas is not common. The virus was isolated from an eyelid specimen of a naturally infected rabbit. The surviving animals were observed for four weeks, blood samples were collected and, after euthanasia, organ specimens were also examined by <b>morphological</b> methods including <b>pathology</b> and electron microscopy. Serum samples were examined by virus neutralisation for antibodies. Genetic analysis of the isolated virus {{was carried out by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The primers were designed {{on the basis of the}} major envelope gene (Env) of the Lausanne reference strain in the GenBank. The viral proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE. The isolated virus (ref. no. : BP 04 / 2001) was able to infect the susceptible animals directly, by contact. The disease was characterised by respiratory symptoms of the upper tracheal tract, conjunctivitis and high mortality by the 11 th- 14 th day. Aerogenic infection with strain BP 04 / 2001 resulted in 100 % morbidity among the susceptible animals. Sequencing of the amplified 400 -bp-long DNA revealed 97 % homology with the Env gene of the Lausanne strain, which proves that strain BP 04 / 2001 is a variant of the Lausanne strain having been enzootic throughout Europe. The live vaccine strain used in Hungary against myxomatosis, which is also a Lausanne-derived strain, protected the animals. According to the protein analysis a protein of 200 kDa in size is not expressed in strain BP 04 / 2001. This is the first report on atypical myxomatosis in Central Europe. The virus spreads by airborne transmission and may cause severe losses in the rabbit population...|$|R
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Hoof lamellar pathology in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) {{has not been}} described previously. Objectives: To describe the histomorphometry and pathological lesions in hoof lamellar tissue of animals that had PPID with or without concurrent laminitis, with reference to age-matched controls. We hypothesised that lamellar lesions consistent with laminitis {{would be associated with}} PPID, even in animals without current or historical laminitis. Study design: Prospective case–control study. Methods: Mid-dorsal hoof histological sections were obtained post mortem from the forelimbs of 16 PPID-affected animals either with (n = 6) or without laminitis (n = 10) and 10 age- and breed-matched controls. Sections were examined by a blinded veterinary pathologist. The length and width of 10 primary epidermal lamellae were measured using image analysis software. The morphology and pathology of primary and secondary epidermal lamellae were then typed or graded in axial, middle and abaxial regions. Fasting serum insulin, plasma adrenocorticotropin and blood glucose concentration were measured from blood samples taken prior to euthanasia. Results: All animals with PPID and laminitis had fasting hyperinsulinaemia (median 74. 1 miu/l, interquartile range 49. 9 – 349. 5 miu/l) whereas PPID animals without laminitis had serum insulin concentrations below the upper limit of the reference range (< 20 miu/l). Lamellar pathology in PPID animals with laminitis was variable in severity and unrelated to the reported duration of laminitis (range 2 months– 5 years). Most lesions were located abaxially within the lamellar tissue and included increased length and width of the lamellae, chronic abnormal keratinisation, interlamellar epidermal bridging and cell death with more acute lamellar tearing in some cases. The lamellae of PPID animals without laminitis were normal referent to the relevant control group. Conclusions: Whether PPID and hyperinsulinaemia have a causal inter-relationship or not, it may only be the hyperinsulinaemia that is associated with lamellar <b>morphological</b> alteration and <b>pathology</b> consistent with laminitis...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} shows that presynaptic nerve terminals throughout the nervous system are vulnerable to a range of traumatic, toxic and disease-related neurodegenerative stimuli. The aim {{of this study was to}} further characterise this vulnerability by examining the response of mouse α-motor nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to hypoxia-reperfusion injury. To address this aim, a novel model system was generated in which ex vivo skeletal muscle preparations could be maintained in an hypoxic environment, at an O 2 concentration below in vivo normoxic values (< 0. 25 % O 2), for 2 hr followed by 2 hr reperfusion (2 H- 2 R). Using this model system combined with quantitative assessment of immunohistological preparations as well as some ultrastructural observations, I present evidence to show that α-motor nerve terminals are rapidly and selectively vulnerable to hypoxia-reperfusion injury with no apparent perturbations to postsynaptic endplates or muscle fibres. I show that the severity of α-motor nerve terminal pathology is age and muscle type/location dependent: in 8 - 12 wk old mice, nerve terminals in fast-twitch lumbrical muscles are more vulnerable than predominantly slow-twitch transversus abdominis and triangularis sterni. In 5 - 6 week old mice however, there is an age dependent increase in vulnerability of α-motor nerve terminals from the predominantly slow-twitch muscles while the fast-twitch lumbricals remained unaffected by age. The functional, <b>morphological</b> and ultrastructural <b>pathology</b> observed in α-motor nerve terminals following 2 H- 2 R is indicative of selective and ongoing nerve terminal disassembly but, occurs via a mechanism distinct from Wallerian degeneration, as the neuroprotective slow Wallerian degeneration (Wlds) gene did not protect nerve terminals from these pathological changes. I also provide provisional evidence to show that 1 A/II muscle spindle afferents and γ-motor nerve terminals are more resistant to hypoxia-reperfusion injury compared with α-motor nerve terminals. In addition to this, I also report preliminary finding that indicate that the oxygen storing protein, neuroglobin, maybe expressed at the mouse NMJ and report the difficulties of using mice that express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in their neurons for repeat/live imaging studies. Overall, these data show that the model of hypoxia-reperfusion injury developed in this study is robust and repeatable, that it induces rapid, quantitative changes in α-motor nerve terminals and that it can be used to further examine the mechanisms regulating nerve terminal vulnerability in response to hypoxia-reperfusion injuries. These findings have clinical implications for the use of surgical tourniquets and in the aetiology of many neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathic sequelae where mechanisms relating to hypoxia and hypoxia-reperfusion injury have been implicated.

40|$|Pretreatment with {{octreotide}} (OCT) in acromegaly {{has been}} reported to improve surgical outcome. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze retrospectively the effects of a 3 - to 6 -month presurgical treatment with OCT in acromegalics focusing on electrocardiographic (ECG) records, blood pressure levels, glucose and lipid profile, tumor size and consistency, easy tumor removal at surgery, and <b>morphological</b> findings at <b>pathology.</b> Fifty-nine patients with acromegaly who were undergoing surgical treatment were studied randomly before surgery; 37 patients were untreated, and 22 were treated with OCT at doses ranging 150 - 600 micrograms/day for 3 - 6 months. At study entry, untreated and OCT-treated patients had similar circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), glucose, and cholesterol levels as well as prevalence of overt diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ECG abnormalities. In untreated and OCT-treated patients, respectively, radiological imaging documented microadenoma in 0 and 1, intrasellar macroadenoma in 10 and 6, intra- and suprasellar macroadenoma in 18 and 11, invasive macroadenoma in 9 and 4 patients. Before surgery, serum GH and IGF-I levels significantly decreased in the 22 OCT-treated acromegalics, and in 5 of them, a significant shrinkage was documented. ECG abnormalities disappeared in 7 of 11 (63. 6 %) OCT-treated patients. In 3 of the 7 patients with diabetes mellitus, treatment with OCT together with low carbohydrate intake normalized blood glucose levels, whereas in 2 patients, insulin could be replaced by oral antidiabetics, and in 2 patients, the insulin dose was reduced. Presurgical blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as systolic (145. 2 +/- 3. 4 vs. 132. 9 +/- 2. 5 mm Hg; P < 0. 01) and diastolic (94. 3 +/- 1. 7 vs. 84. 3 +/- 1. 6 mm Hg; P < 0. 001) blood pressure levels were significantly higher in untreated than in OCT-treated patients. Two weeks after surgery, circulating GH and IGF-I levels were normalized in 11 untreated (29. 7 %) and 12 OCT-treated (54. 5 %) patients (P < 0. 005, by chi 2 test). Macroscopically, no difference was found between untreated and OCT-treated adenomas, whereas at pathology, a significant increases in cellular atypia (31. 6 % vs. 19. 2 %; P < 0. 05) was found in OCT-treated adenomas. One patients in the untreated group died from cardiorespiratory arrest during the early postoperative period. Finally, the average duration of hospitalization after operation was longer in untreated than in OCT-treated patients (8. 6 +/- 0. 7 vs. 5. 6 +/- 0. 5 days). We conclude that a 3 - to 6 -month treatment with OCT before surgery for GH-secreting adenoma improved clinical conditions and surgical outcome and reduced the duration of hospitalization after operation...|$|R
