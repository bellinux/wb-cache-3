Finding {{each of these areas}} unlocks them, making them accessible from the game's <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> in a section called Classic Maps.|$|E
5|$|In early 2016, the a {{la carte}} menu was stopped and the {{restaurant}} moved to serving only set menus. This was attributed to a desire to reduce the food waste produced by the restaurant, which staff hoped that could drop by half {{as a result of}} the change. The children's menu consists of smaller portions of the <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E
5|$|In iOS 10.3, Settings was updated {{to feature}} {{information}} relating to a user's Apple ID account in the <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> and features a section that allows users to see which old, unmaintained apps won't work in future versions of iOS. Additionally, users can now see a breakdown of their iCloud storage.|$|E

This documentation explains {{the basics of}} the editor {{to the concept of}} individual script functions. The game editor website supports a forum that answers more complex questions involving game design and demos to experiment from. The editor forum also gives access to additional files for the amateur to use.|$|R

5|$|Like its predecessor, The Adventure of Link allows storing up {{to three}} games in the cartridge's memory. Once the game has been completed, {{selecting}} the corresponding file in the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> allows starting a new game preserving the acquired experience levels, techniques, and magic spells (but no special items, Heart and Magic containers, or extra lives, which must be obtained again).|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main mode of {{transportation}} between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{features}} {{contained in the}} DVD, the viewer is allowed to select from two different <b>main</b> <b>menus,</b> Spanish or English, in order to change {{the language of the}} biography and menu. With a running time of 99-minutes, the DVD features a biography of the singer and an additional 44-minute behind-the-scenes look at the making of Selena (1997). The DVD chapter listing is identical to the album track listing {{with the exception of the}} spoken liner notes.|$|R

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training missions are unlocked as the missions are completed. The training missions are more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is that campaign missions can now be played individually as the player completes them. Like the training missions, campaign missions can be selected from the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> at any time.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{physical}} {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 slots and loaded from either the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> or during play.|$|E
50|$|The game first {{appeared}} in 1993 on the Amiga and PC DOS computers and was subsequently ported across {{to a wide variety}} of other formats. The DOS version used the standard 320x200 256-color resolution (Mode 13h) just for the planning and <b>main</b> <b>menus,</b> with the tactical simulation part rendered at 640x480 with only 16 colors. The higher resolution permitted finer detail in the graphics and allowed for the illusion that more than 16 colors were used by means of dithering. Similar graphics and same levels design were used in the Macintosh, 3DO, Atari Jaguar and RiscPC ports.|$|R

5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started from the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon {{and an assortment of}} abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E

5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and pull-off functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's <b>main</b> <b>menu).</b> For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> {{of the game is}} designed around the interior of a ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{an unwritten}} rule that the dishes served as hors d'oeuvres do not give any clue to the main meal. They are served with the <b>main</b> meal <b>menu</b> in view either in hot, room {{temperature}} or cold forms; when served hot they are brought out after all the guests arrive so that everyone gets to taste the dishes.|$|R
40|$|A lightweight, {{web based}} with near to {{real-time}} speed {{algorithm is proposed}} in this work. It is able to retrieve <b>main</b> parts (<b>menu,</b> <b>main</b> text, header and footer) of a randomly selected web page entirely using CSS, JavaScript, frames, layers, images, etc. for retrieval. Moreover shortcomings of wellknown modern algorithms for content retrieval from web pages are discussed in this proposal. The algorithm is useful {{for the improvement of}} existing: searching, content matching, summaries making, web graph calculation, and etc. engines. Moreover it is practical as a data provider for classification and data mining. The experimental results of a PHP realization of the algorithm showed near to real-time speed, 20 - 25 % error rate for the multipurpose mode and less than 1 % error rate for the specific mode...|$|R

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight {{chapters}} and a prologue; {{at the end of}} each chapter, the player is graded on their performance, and all of their statistics and medals are reset. The only items which carry over between chapters are emblems, which are given to the player for achieving high scores in a chapter or defeating hidden monsters. High scores are achieved by defeating more enemies, and defeating enemies with high Panic meters. In addition to the main game is a challenge arena, accessible through the <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> where Keldric can fight timed battles against powerful foes. Keldric can fight alongside AI-controlled pets in these challenges, found in eggs throughout the game. The challenge arena also contains a shop, which contains emblems, eggs, and bonuses like extra music or higher game difficulties, which can be bought with money dropped by enemies throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

50|$|The {{characters}} are controlled via radial menus. After selecting a character, the player right clicks {{to open a}} circular menu. From there, hovering over wedges brings out more options, such as specific spells, actions, or inventory items. The <b>main</b> radial <b>menu,</b> which encircles {{a picture of the}} character selected, has up to six sections, the number being based on class abilities. Specific actions are color-coded based on the type of action they are.|$|R
50|$|The Zodiac used a {{modified}} version of the Palm OS, designated version 5.2T. The <b>main</b> navigation <b>menus</b> consisted of 8 radially-arranged choices selected using either the touchscreen or thumbstick. It also came with the Palm OS Productivity Suite (containing a calendar, to do list etc.), an eBook reader, the Wordsmith word processor and the powerOne graphing application. It came bundled with two games, AcidSolitare (by Red Mercury) and Stunt Car Extreme (by Vasara Games).|$|R
