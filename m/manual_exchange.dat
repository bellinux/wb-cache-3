5|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was manually operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency {{even if he was}} away from his home and surgery. The <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E
25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange,</b> e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E
2500|$|... 2L-4N or 2L-5N format (two-letter {{exchange}} {{name and}} either {{four or five}} digits), {{it was possible to}} dial a number located in a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> and be connected without requesting operator assistance. The policy of the Bell System stated that customers in large cities should not need to be concerned with the type of office, whether they were calling a manual or an automatic office.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1970s, New Zealand's {{telephone}} network consisted primarily of step-by-step telephone exchanges, or {{a mixture of}} rotary and step-by-step exchanges in the main centres. A few rural areas were still served by <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Crossbar exchanges were installed from the 1970s, and electronic exchanges from 1982. Local telephone number lengths varied from 3 to 6 digits {{depending on the size}} of exchange and population of the local calling area.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Post Office was run in {{conjunction}} with Telecom {{as one of the}} last <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Australia. It was at this time reduced to a Post Office Agency. 6 April 1990 saw the Post Office Agency cease and a Community Mail Bag was put into operation.|$|R
50|$|For {{calls to}} manual local exchanges with CCI {{equipment}} {{to display the}} called number to the operator, the equipment required at the <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> and the director equipment holding time can be minimised by using storage equipment at the automatic exchange which holds the number information until <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> equipment is available.|$|E
50|$|In 1945 as {{the traffic}} {{increased}} {{it was decided}} to have a separate network for Telex traffic and the first <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> opened in London. By 1954 the public inland Telex service opened via manually switched exchanges. A number of subscribers were served via automatic sub-centres based on Post Office relays and Type 2 Uniselectors acting as concentrators for the <b>manual</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{phone service}} {{began with a}} <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> in the Post Office. A {{subscriber}} trunk dialling system came circa 1981.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 the Betelgeuse {{exploded}} at the jetty at Whiddy Oil Terminal, killing over 40 people. A postal strike {{ran from}} January {{until the end}} of June. It stopped postal service and closed down phone service in those parts of the country still on <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges,</b> including Durrus.|$|R
50|$|In cities outside London, it was {{possible}} to avoid the installation of Coded-Call Indicator (CCI) equipment at <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> by converting to automatic in stages with the issue of a new directory, e.g. converting groups of (say) six exchanges at 12-month intervals; this was done in Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|R
5000|$|A {{subscriber}} in Wimbledon (say) {{would be}} assigned the number {{the first three}} letters, written in capitals, indicated the exchange code to be dialled. The actual trains of pulses from the subscriber's dial were 9461234. The exchange code digits dialled by the calling subscriber were the same from any telephone in the London director area, which has a linked numbering scheme. Subscribers on <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> asked for a number in the format , whether the called number was on a <b>manual</b> or automatic <b>exchange.</b>|$|R
50|$|Holborn {{exchange}} had 9400 subscribers (lines) and had 222 directors, each {{of which}} would on average handle 72 calls in the busy hour (BH) and be held for 20 seconds. Holborn was also a tandem exchange for calls to and from local manual exchanges, so that the tandem traffic from manual exchanges was combined with traffic from automatic exchanges. Handling local calls between manual exchanges via a third operator at a tandem exchange is uneconomic, but without tandem switching each <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> would require direct junctions to every other <b>manual</b> <b>exchange.</b> In London there were 73 manual exchanges within 10 mi of Oxford Circus, of which twennty had CCI (Coded-Call Indicator) equipment which displayed the number dialled to the local <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> operator, and the rest were to be equipped shortly.|$|E
50|$|In the British Director {{telephone}} system, Coded-Call Indicator working (CCI) {{filled a}} similar role, as it displayed dialed telephone numbers {{at the local}} <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> in a mixed (automatic and manual) linked-number area.|$|E
5000|$|Connectivity {{exchange}} (CONEX): In {{an adaptive}} or manually operated high-frequency (HF) radio network, the automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> of information concerning routes to stations {{that are not}} directly reachable by the exchange originator.|$|E
50|$|CN {{inherited}} {{a mixture of}} switching technologies, some dial exchanges (Whitehorse, Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Smith), some <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> (Dawson City). Most settlements had no phone service or {{only one or two}} lines from a larger centre. Dial telephone service was ubiquitous {{by the end of the}} 1960s wherever a local exchange was established.|$|R
50|$|If {{the first}} three letters were {{capitalized}} but not bolded, e.g., HAYes 1295, the caller would dial {{the first three}} letters only, and when connected to Hayes ask the operator for the local number. Later, Coded Call Indicator working equipment was installed at some <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> so that the caller could dial all seven digits, and the required number would be displayed to the operator.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{telephone}} system was heavily damaged in World War II, {{so that by}} the end of the War only about 140 automatic exchanges (mostly in Paris and its [...] "banlieues") and 228 <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> were fully operational. Repair of much of the network had been deferred during the war due to lack of parts, as well as co-opting of technical personnel for German military needs.|$|R
50|$|Calls to manual exchanges (where {{the caller}} asks the <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> {{operator}} for the number) and calls to special service like “0” for Operator or “999” for emergencies {{do not require}} any numeric digits.|$|E
50|$|Ringers were {{commonly}} {{placed in}} the same housing as the subscriber set, which consisted of other electrical components, such as induction coils, capacitors, and, if required, a magneto generator. The subscriber set interfaced a telephone set to the telephone network, while magneto generators were used in a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> to generate a remote ring signal.|$|E
50|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was manually operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency {{even if he was}} away from his home and surgery. The <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E
50|$|Tenindewa {{contained}} the last <b>manual</b> telephone <b>exchange</b> in Western Australia, {{it was closed}} on 13 April 1985.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, {{the first one}} or two digits of {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan areas were alphabetical, with each letter representing a distinct number on the telephone dial. Each one-letter or two-letter code signified an exchange within an urban area. Rural and regional areas typically relied on <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges,</b> or only one automatic exchange for the whole town, so rural and regional numbers did not feature these letter prefixes.|$|R
5000|$|Destinations {{with numbers}} in {{non-standard}} lengths or formats may have required an operator dial the number or request assistance of an inward operator at destination. Rural party line numbers in <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> were prone to awkward, non-standard numbering schemes like [...] "line 10, two long rings and one short" [...] which were gradually eliminated {{as the number}} of parties on a single line was reduced and the manual switchboard replaced by automatic dial equipment.|$|R
50|$|Broughton {{telephone}} exchange was the UK's first Crossbar exchange. The current exchange building, which was extended {{at the front}} in the 1980s, was built for a field trial of Plessey's new 5005A crossbar exchange in 1964 replacing Broughton's <b>manual</b> <b>exchange.</b> The village was chosen due to its relative proximity to the Plessey factory and research centre at Edge Lane Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|The Balranald {{telephone}} exchange was converted from manual to automatic operation in 1988 to 1990. The <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> number prior to automation phone number was (050) 4841 {{to reach the}} exchange, then the numbers (050)201-000 to 201-999 were allocated for Balranald subscribers. Following the ACA renumbering in the late 1990s, the numbers {{are now in the}} (03)5020-1000 to (03)5020-1999 range.|$|E
50|$|The last Los Angeles <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> was THornwall 6, in Burbank, which {{operated}} {{until the}} late 1950s. The last manual office in southern California was in Avalon, on Catalina Island, dating from a radiotelephone service installed in the early 1920s. Pacific Telephone later laid two submarine cables to link the island to the mainland. Avalon was converted to dial in 1978, using switching equipment 23 miles away in the San Pedro central office.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of 111, access to emergency services was complicated. For the quarter of New Zealand’s then 414,000 telephone subscribers that were still on <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges,</b> one would simply pick up the telephone and ask the answering operator for the police, ambulance, or fire service by name. However, the problem was on <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges</b> the calls were answered first-come-first-served, which meant on busy exchanges, emergency calls could be delayed. For automatic exchanges, one would need to look up the local police, ambulance or fire service’s telephone number in the telephone directory, know the number by heart, or dial the toll operator {{and ask them to}} place the call. The problem was that the numbers were different for each exchange, and again, {{there was no way to}} tell emergency calls apart from regular calls. Auckland, for example, had 40 telephone exchanges, and the telephone directory had 500 pages to search through to find the right number, although the separate emergency numbers for fire, police and ambulance in the main service area (e.g. Auckland, but not for not minor exchanges) were listed in bold on the first page.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{telephone}} system was upgraded, from <b>Manual</b> Switching <b>Exchange</b> to Auto Telephone System. Local Area Code is 061, it was same as Chauk.|$|R
5000|$|In early {{electromechanical}} switches including panel switch, a [...] "district junctor" [...] handled {{supervision and}} talk battery duties for outgoing calls, {{similar to the}} duties of the cord circuit of <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The junctors for incoming calls were simple three-wire connections between the incoming frame and the line frame. In the later electromechanical 5XB switch, junctors only consisted of three wires to connect the two legs of a call: the line and the trunk, of which the latter supplied all talk battery and supervision.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of these first {{conversions}} to automated equipment in the 1920s, through the conversions of most manual equipment by the 1960s, {{it was necessary for}} telephone numbers to be represented uniformly across the nation. By Bell System policy, customers never needed to be concerned about whether they were calling an automatic or a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange.</b> The 2L-5N system became the North American standard, as customer-dialed long distance service came into use in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|In 1896 Cumborah was proclaimed a {{town and}} the local police station {{operated}} from 1898 until 1934. A small mail receiving office opened in 1892; this was upgraded to a post office in 1898 which was closed in 1963. The village had a provisional school from 1899 to 1903 and a public school from 1904 until 1943. A telephone office opened in 1901 and a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> in 1912. By 1915 Cumborah had five telephone subscribers that could only contact Walgett or Dangar Bridge. From 1917 {{it was possible to}} telephone other local towns.|$|E
50|$|In {{the largest}} cities, it took {{many years to}} convert every office to {{automatic}} equipment, such as a panel switch. During this transition period, once numbers were standardized to the 2L-4N or 2L-5N format (two-letter exchange name and either four or five digits), {{it was possible to}} dial a number located in a <b>manual</b> <b>exchange</b> and be connected without requesting operator assistance. The policy of the Bell System stated that customers in large cities should not need to be concerned with the type of office, whether they were calling a manual or an automatic office.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{building}} was originally constructed in 1928. It was originally {{used as the}} office for <b>manual</b> telephone <b>exchange</b> and upgraded to mechanical telephone exchange in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco {{continued}} to install manual offices throughout the 1920s. When PT&T {{took over the}} operations of its San Francisco and Oakland competitor, Home Telephone Co., in the early 1920s, their customers were switched from Home's dial service to Pacific Telephone <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges.</b> [...] A 1927 Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. publication proudly describes the company's newest manual offices, without a word of plans to introduce dial service. [...] San Francisco's first dial office, ORdway, opened on 23 March 1929. The first suburban step-by-step (electromechanical stepping switch) office opened in Palo Alto in 1929.|$|R
50|$|As the {{translation}} facility incorporated {{was similar to}} the register in common control systems, the Director system incorporates two features of the Panel system, which was introduced in large American cities, and which were required regardless of the type of exchange system for these large areas which would have a mixture of <b>manual</b> and automatic <b>exchanges</b> for some years. Customer stations were assigned seven-digit numbers, with the first three digits spelling out the local exchange name; this expedited call handling particularly to and from <b>manual</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Direct or tandem junction routes to other exchanges could be allocated as required, with routing independent of the telephone number and able to be altered at any time to cater for traffic growth or the introduction of new local or tandem exchanges.|$|R
