5000|$|The {{triggering}} electrode is {{most often}} mounted {{through a hole in}} the center of the positive <b>main</b> <b>electrode.</b> The undrilled <b>main</b> <b>electrode</b> is the negative electrode. When switching high currents, the electrodes undergo considerable heat stress, as they are directly involved in the electric arc. This causes the surfaces to undergo gradual vaporization, so some designs incorporate methods to easily adjust the distance between the electrodes or to actually replace the electrodes. The main electrodes are typically fabricated from brass, or alloys of copper and tungsten for longer electrode life.|$|E
50|$|The {{mercury in}} the tube is a liquid at normal temperatures. It {{needs to be}} vaporized and ionized before the tube will conduct {{electricity}} and the arc can start. So, like fluorescent tubes, mercury vapor lamps require a starter, which is usually contained within the mercury vapor lamp itself. A third electrode is mounted {{near one of the}} main electrodes and connected through a resistor to the other <b>main</b> <b>electrode.</b> In addition to the mercury, the tube is filled with argon gas at low pressure. When power is applied, there is sufficient voltage to ionize the argon and strike a small arc between the starting electrode and the adjacent <b>main</b> <b>electrode.</b> This starting arc discharge heats the mercury and eventually provides enough ionized mercury to strike an arc between the main electrodes. This process takes from 4 to 7 minutes, so mercury lamps are slow starting. Some bulbs include a thermal switch which shorts the starting electrode to the adjacent <b>main</b> <b>electrode,</b> extinguishing the starting arc once the main arc strikes.|$|E
50|$|A {{very closely}} related lamp design called the {{metal halide lamp}} uses various {{compounds}} in an amalgam with the mercury. Sodium iodide and scandium iodide are commonly in use. These lamps can produce much better quality light without resorting to phosphors. If they use a starting electrode, {{there is always a}} thermal shorting switch to eliminate any electrical potential between the <b>main</b> <b>electrode</b> and the starting electrode once the lamp is lit. (This electrical potential {{in the presence of the}} halides can cause the failure of the glass/metal seal). More modern metal halide systems do not use a separate starting electrode; instead, the lamp is started using high voltage pulses as with high-pressure sodium vapor lamps.|$|E
50|$|A {{trigatron}} {{has three}} <b>electrodes.</b> The heavy <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{are for the}} high current switching path, and a smaller third electrode serves as the trigger. During normal operation, the voltage between the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> is somewhat lower than the breakdown voltage corresponding to their distance and the dielectric between them (usually air, argon-oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or sulfur hexafluoride). To switch the device, a high voltage pulse is delivered to the triggering electrode. This ionizes the medium between it {{and one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>electrodes,</b> creating a spark which shortens the thickness of non-ionized medium between the electrodes. The triggering spark also generates ultraviolet light and free electrons in the main gap. These lead to the rapid electrical breakdown of the main gap, culminating in a low resistance electric arc between the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The arc will continue to conduct until current flow drops sufficiently to extinguish it.|$|R

50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the <b>main</b> <b>electrode</b> {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{simultaneous}} paired stimulation of electrodes in cochlear implants is investigated by psychophysical experiments in 8 post-lingually deaf subjects (and one extra subject who only participated {{in part of}} the experiments). Simultaneous and sequential monopolar stimulation modes are used as references and are compared to channel interaction compensation, partial tripolar stimulation and a novel sequential stimulation strategy named phased array compensation. Psychophysical experiments are performed to investigate both the loudness integration during paired stimulation at the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{as well as the}} interaction with the electrode contact located halfway between the stimulating pair. The study shows that simultaneous monopolar stimulation has more loudness integration on the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> and more interaction in between the electrodes than sequential stimulation. Channel interaction compensation works to reduce the loudness integration at the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes,</b> but does not reduce the interaction in between the electrodes caused by paired stimulation.

In phased array compensation we have used the individual impedance matrix of each subject to calculate the current needed on each electrode to exactly match the stimulation voltage along the array to that of sequential stimulation. The results show that the interaction in between the electrodes is the same as monopolar stimulation. The strategy uses less current than partial tripolar stimulation, but more than monopolar stimulation.

40|$|Switching high {{currents}} {{in the order}} of kA between high voltage potentials is of considerable interest for pulse power, plasma and particle accelerator applications [1, 2]. A main drawback of available switching devices like Thyratrons, Ignitrons and Spark Gaps is the matter of electrode erosion when it comes to switching high currents. Solid State devices like Thyristors or IGBT´s still face serious problems switching voltages of more than 15 kV, because of the limited breakdown voltage of solid state devices. Though staking of solid state switches is a solution [1], it makes the anticipated switch highly expensive. For this reason a new gas discharge switch called the LDS (Lorentz Drift Switch) was invented by the authors [3] and is now under investigation at the J. W. Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt. The main component of this new switch is a coaxial electrode system consisting of a central electrode at positive potential and a outer electrode at ground potential. Situated between the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> is a pin electrode which triggers a discharge if a high voltage pulse is applied. A high current discharge created between the <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> will generate a significant amount of Lorentz force, which propels the discharge upwards towards the open end of the coaxial electrode system [2].

This means that the excitation circuit for the ES-Kicker must be carefully designed, since the falling edge of the electric field is strongly affected by parasitic capacitance of this circuit, and any remaining field may disturb the circulating beam.

40|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{a number}} of important tubular products stringent requirements have been imposed on quality of their inner surfaces. The well-known methods for inner surface treatment of pipes include sandblasting, chemical cleaning with acid reagents (oxalic, formic, sulfamic, orthophosphoric acids) and electrochemical polishing. Disadvantages of the chemical method are cleaning-up irregularities, high metal removal, limited number of reagent application, complicated selection of reagent chemical composition and concentration, complicated and environmentally harmful recycling of waste chemicals, high cost of reagents. Low productivity at a high cost, as well as hazardous impact on personnel due to high dispersion of abrasive dust are considered as disadvantages of sandblasting. Electrochemical polishing is characterized by the following disadvantages: low processing productivity because supply of high currents is rather difficult due to electrolyte scattering capacity away from the <b>main</b> <b>electrode</b> action zone, limited length of the cavity to be treated due to heating of flexible current leads at operating current densities, application of expensive aggressive electrolytes and high costs of their recycling.

A large graphite or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the anode.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Nanosatellites and CubeSats is currently limited by their susceptibility to natural de‐orbiting. An appropriately scaled pulsed plasma thruster {{offers the most}} adaptable technological {{solution to this problem}} by compensating for atmospheric drag. This technology can be used to aid the spacecraft de‐orbiting to comply with the 25 years de‐orbiting guidelines. A PPT consists of a pair of electrodes separated by a propellant bar than can be fed either from the side or from the breech of the electrodes. The electrodes are connected to a main capacitor bank charged to a voltage of the order of 1 ‐ 2 kV and storing energy of some joules. To operate the thruster a high voltage pulse (5 ‐ 10 kV) is sent to a spark plug. This triggers a discharge between the two <b>main</b> <b>electrodes</b> that ablates some of the propellant, ionizes it, and expels it to high velocity generating thrust. The design of the electronics and the thruster head of the nanosat and CubeSat PPT have evolved over time based on tests and experiments during several test campaigns. Inherent constraints such as small size and limited power budget of this type of satellites have been overcome by the use of the proposed topology. Previous designs use voltage multipliers for high voltage generation in the ignition circuit. These circuits provide a very simple way of generating the high voltage needed for such circuit. However the repeatability of the high voltage pulse event it is not precisely controlled. The following paper presents a new topology used for the electronics of the PPT that brings the following advantages with respect to other topologies used: lower power consumption achieved by the use of a pre‐charged stage before all the energy is released into the high voltage stage, better control of the power consumption; a more accurate control of the firing process; and a smaller size. These characteristics allow the use of the same circuit to provide the high energy to be stored between the anode and the cathode of the chamber and for the ignition circuit, thus simplifying the design and test of the overall system. The results presented in this paper show that the design proposed provides lower power consumption and a more precise control of the ignition process compared to previous designs. The proposed design is also scalable to be used in thrusters for bigger satellites offering the previously cited advantages...|$|R
