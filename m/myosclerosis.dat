40|$|Three {{cases are}} {{described}} presenting with progressive contractures in whom the muscles felt firm and `woody' and a clinical diagnosis of <b>myosclerosis</b> {{was made in}} each case. A patient and his young sister were shown to be suffering from spinal muscular atrophy with superimposed, excessive proliferative activity of fibroblasts, and in these cases a beneficial effect of penicillamine was demonstrated. The third case with a clinical picture of <b>myosclerosis</b> was found on muscle biopsy to have extensive inflammatory infiltration of the connective tissue, and responded temporarily at least to high doses of corticosteroids. It is emphasized that several different disease entities can give rise to this clinical picture...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the clinical and molecular {{features of a}} new phenotype related to collagen VI myopathies. METHODS: We examined two patients belonging to a consanguineous family affected by <b>myosclerosis</b> myopathy, screened for mutations of collagen VI genes, and performed a detailed biochemical and morphologic analysis of the muscle biopsy and cultured fibroblasts. RESULTS: The patients had a novel homozygous nonsense COL 6 A 2 mutation (Q 819 X); the mutated messenger RNA escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was translated into a truncated alpha 2 (VI) chain, lacking the sole C 2 domain. The truncated chain associated {{with the other two}} chains, giving rise to secreted collagen VI. Monomers containing the truncated chain were assembled into dimers, but tetramers were almost absent; secreted collagen VI was quantitatively reduced and structurally abnormal in cultured fibroblasts. Mutated collagen did not correctly localize in the basement membrane of muscle fibers and was absent in the capillary wall. Ultrastructural analysis of muscle showed an unusual combination of basement membrane thickening and duplication, and increased number of pericytes. CONCLUSIONS: This familial case has the characteristic features of <b>myosclerosis</b> myopathy and carries a homozygous COL 6 A 2 mutation responsible for a peculiar pattern of collagen VI defects. Our study demonstrates that <b>myosclerosis</b> myopathy should be considered a collagen VI disorder allelic to Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopath...|$|E

Unlike UCMD, BM {{is difficult to}} diagnose due to its clinical overlap with other contractural phenotypes {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of standard immunohistochemica! diagnostic techniques in muscle biopsy samples. This thesis investigates the potential of two prospective diagnostic techniques, and proposes an algorithm for better BM diagnosis based on immunofluorescent labelling of collagen VI in skin biopsy-derived fibroblast cells.

40|$|Collagen VI is an {{extracellular}} matrix protein expressed in several tissues including skeletal muscle. Mutations in COL 6 A genes cause Bethlem Myopathy (BM), Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD) and <b>Myosclerosis</b> Myopathy (MM). Collagen VI deficiency causes increased {{opening of the}} mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), leading to ultrastructural and functional alterations of mitochondria, amplified by impairment of autophagy. Here we report {{for the first time}} ultrastructural studies on muscle biopsies from BM and UCMD patients, showing swollen mitochondria with hypodense matrix, disorganized cristae and paracrystalline inclusions, associated with dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum and apoptotic changes. These data were supported by scanning electron microscopy analysis on BM and UCMD cultured cells, showing alterations of the mitochondrial network. Morphometric analysis also revealed a reduced short axis and depicted swelling in about 3...|$|E
40|$|<b>Myosclerosis</b> are {{diseases}} caused bymutations in {{the genes}} encoding the extracellularmatrix protein collagen VI. A dystrophic mouse model, where collagen VI synthesis was prevented by targeted inactivation of theCol 6 a 1 gene, allowed the investigation of pathogenesis,which revealed {{the existence of a}} Ca 2 þ-mediated dysfunction of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of defective autophagy. Key events are dysregulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an inner membrane high-conductance channel that for pro-longed open times causes mitochondrial dysfunction, and inadequate removal of defective mitochondria, which amplifies the damage. Consistently, the Col 6 a 12 / 2 myopathic mice could be cured through inhibition of cyclophilinD, amatrix protein that sensitizes the pore to opening, and through stimulation of autophagy. Similar defects contribute to disease path-ogenesis in patients irrespective of the genetic lesion causing the collagen VI defect. These studies indicate that permeability transition pore opening and defective autophagy represent keyelements for skeletalmuscle fiber death, andprovide a rationale for the use of cyclosporin A and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives in patients affected by collagen VI myopathies, a strategy that holds great promise for treatment...|$|E
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} was initially {{described as a}} <b>myosclerosis</b> because of the conspicuous progression of interstitial fibrosis. Using the mdx mouse homologue, we have shown previously that the accumulation of intramuscular collagen is profoundly influenced by {{the presence or absence}} of T lymphocytes. Here we have used thymectomy and antibody depletion to examine the effect of ablating CD 4 or CD 8 or both subsets of T lymphocytes on skeletal muscle fibrosis in mdx and C 57 BL 10 (wild-type) mice. Depletion of either or both subsets at 4 weeks of age did not influence fibrosis in mdx mice, as determined by measuring hydroxyproline levels and collagen deposition in diaphragm. Additionally, expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1, which is implicated in collagen deposition, either decreased (mdx mice) or increased (C 57 BL/ 10 mice) after double CD 4 / 8 depletion. Our data suggest that depletion of lymphoid cells may affect the tight regulatory control of transforming growth factor-beta 1, with possible pleiotropic effects, and more importantly, that the fibrotic process is self-sustaining from a very early stage...|$|E
40|$|Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem Myopathy (BM) and Congenital <b>Myosclerosis</b> are {{diseases}} due to {{mutations in}} the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI. A dystrophic mouse model where collagen VI synthesis was prevented by targeted inactivation of the Col 6 a 1 gene allowed the investigation of pathogenesis, which revealed {{the existence of a}} Ca 2 +-mediated dysfunction of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of defective autophagy. Key events are dysregulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an inner membrane high-conductance channel that for prolonged open times causes mitochondrial dysfunction; and inadequate removal of defective mitochondria, which amplifies the damage. Consistently, the Col 6 a 1 -/- myopathic mice could be cured with through inhibition of cyclophilin D, a matrix protein that sensitizes the pore to opening, and through stimulation of autophagy. Similar defects contribute to disease pathogenesis in patients irrespective of the genetic lesion causing the collagen VI defect.

40|$|Collagen VI myopathies (Ullrich {{congenital}} {{muscular dystrophy}} (UCMD), Bethlem myopathy (BM), and <b>myosclerosis</b> myopathy) share a common pathogenesis, that is, mitochondrial dysfunction due to deregulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP). This effect was first identified in the Col 6 a 1 (-/-) mouse model and then in muscle cell cultures from UCMD and BM patients; the normalizing effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) confirmed the pathogenic role of PTP opening. In order to determine whether mitochondrial performance {{can be used as}} a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials and as an outcome measure of the patient response to therapy, it is mandatory to establish whether mitochondrial dysfunction is conserved in primary cell cultures from UCMD and BM patients. In this study we report evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and the consequent increase of apoptotic rate can be detected not only, as previously reported, in muscle, but also in fibroblast cell cultures established from muscle biopsies of collagen VI-related myopathic patients. However, the mitochondrial phenotype is no longer maintained after nine passages in culture. These data demonstrate that the dire consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction are not limited to myogenic cells, and that this parameter {{can be used as a}} suitable diagnostic criterion, provided that the cell culture conditions are carefully established...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCollagen VI is a non-fibrillar {{collagen}} {{present in}} the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a complex polymer; the mainly expressed form is composed of α 1, α 2 and α 3 chains; mutations in genes encoding these chains cause myopathies known as Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem myopathy (BM) and <b>myosclerosis</b> myopathy (MM). The collagen VI α 6 chain is a recently identified component of the ECM of the human skeletal muscle. Here we report that the α 6 chain was dramatically reduced in skeletal muscle and muscle cell cultures of genetically characterized UCMD, BM and MM patients, independently of the clinical phenotype, the gene involved {{and the effect of}} the mutation on the expression of the “classical” α 1 α 2 α 3 heterotrimer. By contrast, the collagen VI α 6 chain was normally expressed or increased in the muscle of patients affected by other forms of muscular dystrophy, the overexpression matching with areas of increased fibrosis. In vitro treatment with TGF-β 1, a potent collagen inducer, promoted the collagen VI α 6 chain deposition in the ECM of normal muscle cells, whereas, in cultures derived from collagen VI-related myopathy patients, the collagen VI α 6 chain failed to develop a network outside the cells and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The defect of the α 6 chain points to a contribution to the pathogenesis of collagen VI-related disorders...|$|E
40|$|Collagen VI is an {{extracellular}} matix {{protein that}} forms a microfilamentous network in skeletal muscles and other organs. In humans, mutations in the collagen VI alpha 1, 2 and 3 genes cause congenital muscular dystrophies as Bethlem, Ullrich and <b>Myosclerosis.</b> Mitochondrial pore abnormalities and {{defect in the}} autophagic pathways have been identified both in patients and in Col 6 a 2 KO mouse model. In order to bridging these findings to the transcriptome, we have performed whole expression profile in both wild type and KO mice. The transcritpomic data were also analysed by an ad hoc designed software enabling us to design an interactome map of the de-regulated transcripts highlighted by the array studies. The mice muscles analysed were diaphragm, gastrocnemious and tibilias. Various transcripts belonging to the muscle development and regeneration, also including genes involved in the apoptosis and autophagy control are consistently de-regulated in KO mice, supporting the role that these processes play in the disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, six genes acting within the circadian clock mechanisms are constantly down-regulated in KO mice. This behavior is constant in all muscles analysed, though more prominent in tibialis. The pathway scan analysis revealed connections between clock genes and apoptosis and autophagy {{as well as with}} muscle regeneration and muscle signaling, opening a previously undisclosed role of circadian rhythm in muscle diseases. These finding make clock genes down-regulation exploratory biomarkers of collagen VI pathology...|$|E
40|$|Collagen VI {{is a major}} {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) protein with {{a critical role in}} maintaining skeletal muscle functional integrity. Mutations in COL 6 A 1, COL 6 A 2 and COL 6 A 3 genes cause Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem Myopathy, and <b>Myosclerosis.</b> Moreover, Col 6 a 1 (-/-) mice and collagen VI deficient zebrafish display a myopathic phenotype. Recently, two additional collagen VI chains were identified in humans, the α 5 and α 6 chains, however their distribution patterns and functions in human skeletal muscle have not been thoroughly investigated yet. By means of immunofluorescence analysis, the α 6 chain was detected in the endomysium and perimysium, while the α 5 chain labeling was restricted to the myotendinous junctions. In normal muscle cultures, the α 6 chain was present in traces in the ECM, while the α 5 chain was not detected. In the absence of ascorbic acid, the α 6 chain was mainly accumulated into the cytoplasm of a sub-set of desmin negative cells, likely of interstitial origin, which can be considered myofibroblasts as they expressed α-smooth muscle actin. TGF-β 1 treatment, a pro-fibrotic factor which induces trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, increased the α 6 chain deposition in the {{extracellular matrix}} after addition of ascorbic acid. In order to define the involvement of the α 6 chain in muscle fibrosis we studied biopsies of patients affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We found that the α 6 chain was dramatically up-regulated in fibrotic areas where, in contrast, the α 5 chain was undetectable. Our results show a restricted and differential distribution of the novel α 6 and α 5 chains in skeletal muscle when compared to the widely distributed, homologous α 3 chain, suggesting that these new chains may play specific roles in specialized ECM structures. While the α 5 chain may have a specialized function in tissue areas subjected to tensile stress, the α 6 chain appears implicated in ECM remodeling during muscle fibrosis...|$|E
