The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Matricaria recutita on spermatogenesis and the pituitary-gonadal axis in male adult rats.   Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, the animals were divided into two groups: the control group, which received 1 ml of distilled water orally, and the experimental group, which received 100 mg/kg of Matricaria recutita extract via gavage feeding once daily for an 8 -week period. After the treatment period, several fertility indices such as the weight of the reproductive organs, sperm count, sperm motility and vitality, and testis histological changes as well as blood serum levels of testosterone, estrogen, FSH, and LH were measured.   Results: Our statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the weight of the reproductive organs, sperm count, and blood testosterone in the group which received 100 mg/kg of Matricaria recutita hydroalcholic extract.   Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that hydroalcholic extract of Matricaria recutita could increase the function of the hormonal pituitary-testis axis and spermatogenesis in male rats. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Capillaria aerophila, Capillaria boehmi and Trichuris vulpis are trichuroid {{nematodes}} affecting {{wild and}} companion animals {{all over the}} World. The canine intestinal whipworm, T. vulpis, is the <b>most</b> common and <b>well-</b> known in veterinary practice, whereas the respiratory C. aerophila and C. boehmi have been rarely reported in pets as a likely consequence of overlapping morphometric and morphological features of the eggs, which impair a correct etiological diagnosis. Findings In December 2011, a mixed infestation by T. vulpis, C. aerophila and C. boehmi was diagnosed in an asymptomatic dog living in central Italy. Morphometric and morphological findings and pictures of the eggs found at the copromicroscopic analysis are herein reported. Conclusions The present work demonstrates that when trichuroid eggs are found in a faecal sample from a dog, a careful morphological and morphometric analysis of individual parasite elements is mandatory. Key diagnostic features (i. e., size, wall surface pattern and aspects of plugs) should be carefully examined when eggs with overlapping shape and appearance are detected. In conclusion, given the importance in clinical practice of canine trichuroids and the zoonotic potential of C. aerophila, these nematodes should be included into the differential diagnosis of intestinal and respiratory parasitoses of dogs by a thorough microscopic analysis of all trichuroid ova present in microscopic fields. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} {{factors related}} to advanced-stage diagnosis of oral cancer to disclose high-risk groups and facilitate early detection strategies. Study design: An ambispective cohort study on 88 consecutive patients treated from January 1998 to December 2003. Inclusion criteria: pathological diagnosis of OSCC (primary tumour) at any oral site and suffering from a tumour at any TNM stage. Variables considered: age, gender, smoking history, alcohol usage, tumour site, macroscopic pattern of the lesion, co-existing precancerous lesion, degree of differentiation, diagnostic delay and TNM stage. Results: A total of 88 patients (mean age 60 ± 11. 3; 65. 9 % males) entered the study. Most patients (54. 5 %) suffered no delayed diagnosis and 45. 5 % of the carcinomas were diagnosed at early stages (I-II). The most frequent clinical lesions were ulcers (70. 5 %). <b>Most</b> cases were <b>well-</b> and moderately-differentiated (91 %). Univariate analyses revealed strong associations between advanced stages and moderate-poor differentiation (OR= 4. 2; 95 %CI= 1. 6 - 10. 9) or tumour site (floor of the mouth (OR= 3. 6; 95 %CI= 1. 2 - 11. 1); gingivae (OR= 8. 8; 95 %CI= 2. 0 - 38. 2); and retromolar trigone (OR= 8. 8; 95 %CI= 1. 5 - 49. 1)). Regression analysis recognised {{the site of the}} tumour and the degree of differentiation as significantly associated to high risk of late-stage diagnosis. Conclusions: Screening programmes designed to detect asymptomatic oral cancers should be prioritized. Educational interventions on the population and on the professionals should include a sound knowledge of the disease presentation, specifically on sites like floor of the mouth, gingivae and retromolar trigone.

Under the rubric of complex systems theory, catastrophe theory, chaos theory, hierarchy theory and the interrelated theories of self-organization have profound implications for the way understand the world around us. The ﬁeld of environmental planning and management exists along the boundary between two complex systems: the ecological and the human socio-economic. Until recently efforts to conserve, restore or even understand such complex sociobiophysical systems have been limited on a theoretical or even epistemological level.

It is produced naturally by beetles of family Meloidae and Oedemeridae, however a considerable spectra of other insects sequestered it too. Cantharidin along with the other analogue, Palasonin, which has a methyl group less than it, found in the hemolymph and all tissues of both cantharidin producing and cantharipilous taxa. Although, palasonon mostly found in low volume, some species bear it even in a higher amount than cantharidin; thus it may be regarded as a precursor for cantharidin synthesis in producing taxa. Measuring titre of both chemicals in Iranian blister beetles from Nahavand county, Hamedan Province and some other species from France, Italy and South Africa, we have tried to have an index to differentiate species or at least different poulations of the same species as it has already done for family Staphylinidae. In this way, cantharidin may not be a good inicator, but it seems more effective along with other analogues, chemicals and some simple physiological information. Cantharidin/Palasonin ratio (C:P) is a better index which seems efficient in dividing European species from similar South African ones. Palasonin itself can be used to diffrentiate Iranian species from all other studied groups. More chemicals used in this new developed method, more precise is the classification...|$|E
40|$|William Paley's Natural Theology is {{probably}} the nineteenth century's <b>most</b> <b>well-</b> known design argument. As such an influential book, it is almost expected that twentieth century intellectual historians should at least pay a footnote to it. In midst of all these studies {{about the impact of}} Natural Theology upon the nineteenth century, one key fact is forgotten: Natural Theology and its sources were written in the eighteenth century. It is the goal of this thesis to demonstrate that Paley's design argument must be compared to the intellectual climate of that time period. Chapters 1 and 2 outline the rhetorical argument and the tools that Paley used to persuade his polite eighteenth century audience. The majority of scientific sources and examples he used were well-known names and therefore implicitly contributed to the believability of his argument. Accordingly, chapters 3 and 4 investigate why Paley's scientific sources added credibility to Natural Theology. Chapters 5 and 6 examine the actual scientific data that Paley turned into examples for his design argument. Setting the rhetoric aside, what was the actual scientific picture communicated by his examples? In these chapters, we find that even though Paley argues against random change, he does support a morphological telic change—the development of a supplemental part based on a pre-existing, fixed body part. As every chapter of this thesis unfolds, it will become more apparent that Paley was an intellectual heir to the eighteenth century. He wrote in a polite manner and employed a body of standard eighteenth century natural philosophical knowledge. It is this context that must be addressed and seriously considered when studying the nineteenth century intellectual legacy of Natural Theology...|$|E

40|$|Maria Montessori {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>well-</b> known {{women in}} Italian history (Figu-re 1) 1. Although she was the first woman obtaining an MD title in Italy, she is mostly known as an {{educator}} and pedagogue: a true pioneer in children’s education 2. Her teaching method-the eponymous “Mon-tessori Method”- is still used by thousands of kin-dergartens, elementary, middle and high schools all over the world. She was born August 31, 1870, in Chiaravalle, an Italian village in the Ancona province, but spent her youth in Rome. She attended the elementary school without remarkable results, due to health problems. Growing up, she showed a particular inclination for scientific topics. Despite many obstacles, she enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine at the Sapienza University of Rome. During an interview with The Globe, she would later declare that she asked for help from Pope Leone XIII to enter the Faculty. Thanks to her stubbornness, she became the first Italian woman to graduate in medicine, in 1896. During the university years, she focused her studies and research on paediatrics, psychiatry and hygiene, subjects on which she proved her interest even later. After graduating, she became assistant in the psychiatric clinic at the University of Rome, taking care of children with mental problems. During this period of time she attended medical conferences and meetings in Europe. Montessori had the chan-ce to know and deepen her knowledge on methods and theories about the recovery of “abnormal children ” as they were called at the time. By reading the works of the French pedagogue Jean Marc Gaspard Itard (1774 - 1838) 3, 4 and his collaborator Edouard Seguin (1812 - 1880) 5, both considered the fathers of social pedagogy, she began to study the possibility for inserting these “abnormal ” children back to the community, through an adequate educational path, until she reached the conclusion that the treatment for these children should have been pedagogical, in addition to medical. In this period Montessori contributed to women’s emancipation. She joined the Women’s Congress of Berlin in 1896 as a representative of Italy, delivering a famous speech on the right t...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{southern}} foreland (proforeland) of the pyrenean orogeny {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>well-</b> known foreland in the world, on {{the opposite}} its northern retroforeland (i. e the Aquitaine basin) which display a quite different tectonic style is less documented apart from local petroleum studies. Strong efforts {{have been made in the}} recent years to improve the knowledge of the Pyrenean orogeny and Aquitaine basin. We present here a synthesis of the Aquitain basin evolution during Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene based on the integration of more than 800 petroleum wells and 5000 km of seismic profiles. An harmonized and detailed litho- and sequence stratigraphy was build up for the entire period allowing to recompose large scale sections, thickness and facies map at the scale of 1 My, and sedimentary response to compressive deformation. The distribution, style and timing of deformation of the retroforeland are precised thanks to refined stratigraphic constraints. Within Cenozoic, five major tecto- sedimentary cycles are identified: 2 Paleocene cycles : -A Danian-Selandian cycle (P 1), and a Thanetian cycle (P 2), both characterized by carbonate platform growth and limited compressive deformations. 3 Eocene cycles: -An Ypresian- Lower Lutetian cycle (E 1) composed of prograding deltas from east to west that redistribute material coming from the emerging mountain belt in eastern Pyrenees. This progradation trend leads to relatively quick infilling of the available space and emersion of a large part of the basin. -A Lutetian- Bartonian cycle (E 2) composed of mixed carbonate siliciclastic deposits. -A Priabonian cycle (E 3) marked by a large scale emersion of the basin and deposition of fined-grained continental sedimentation (Molasses d’Aquitaine). The timing of deformation is refined and confirms (1) the onset of compressive deformations during upper Cretaceous, (2) the occurrence of a relatively quiet period during Paleocene, and (3) a major period of basin deformation during Eocene. Within the basin, compressive deformations take place at both basin and local scale the latter being mainly recorded as reactivation of inherited extensive faulting dating from Albian and /or late Variscan extension, and salt tectonics reactivation mainly in the western part of the basin. Within Eocene, two periods of deformation corresponding with the two successive tecto-sedimentary cycles (E 1 and E 2) are identified. Onset of compressive deformations is diachronous from east to west. Early Eocene deformations mainly take place in the eastern and central part of the basin, with renewed deformations around Paleocene- Eocene boundary, coeval with the onset of terrigenous input from the growing mountain belt, and major pulse by Upper Ypresian. Late Lutetian- Early Bartonian deformations during cycle E 2 are recorded throughout the basin and trigger major depocenter shifts. This refined timing of these deformation correlates with the one of the southern Pyrenean foreland deformations and suggest common control. These results were acquired during the Gaia project founded by TIGF, BRGM and Agence de l’Eau Adour/Garonne which aims to constrain the nature and dynamics of deep Upper cretaceous and Tertiary aquifers of the Aquitaine basin...|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with other}} primates, New World monkeys display {{relatively}} limited ecological variability. New World monkey anatomy and social systems, however, are extremely diverse. Several unique morphological features (e. g., claws, prehensile tails) and uncommon patterns {{of social organization}} (e. g., paternal care, cooperative breeding, female dispersal) have evolved in some platyrrhine species. Social organization and mating patterns include typical harem- like structures where mating is largely polygynous, and large multimale, multifemale groups with promiscuous mating and fi ssion- fusion societies. In addition, some species are socially monogamous and polyandrous. Even closely related species may exhibit strikingly different social organizations, as {{the example of the}} squirrel monkeys demonstrates (Mitchell et al. 1991; Boinski et al. 2005 b). New World monkey behavior varies within species as well as between them. While the behavior of many species is known from only one study site, intriguing patterns of intraspecific variation are beginning to emerge from observations of populations that sometimes live in close proximity. For example, spider monkeys are often described as showing sex- segregated ranging behavior. Several studies show that males range farther, travel faster, and use larger areas than females, who tend to restrict their habitual ranging to smaller core areas within a group’s large territory (Symington 1988; Chapman 1990; Shimooka 2005). In at least one well- studied population in Yasuní National Park, Ecuador, however, males and females both travel over the entire community home range, and different females within the community show little evidence of occupying distinct core areas (Spehar et al. 2010). Similarly, in <b>most</b> <b>well-</b> studied populations of spider monkeys, females disperse and the resident males within a group are presumed to be close relatives—a suggestion corroborated by genetic data for one local population of spider monkeys in Yasuní. Still, in a different local population, males are not closely related to one another, an unexpected pattern if signifi cant male philopatry were common (Di Fiore 2009; Di Fiore et al. 2009). While the causes of this local variation in group genetic structure are not clear, it may be signifi cant that the groups examined likely had different histories of contact with humans. For longlived animals who occupy relatively small social groups, the loss of even a handful of individuals to hunting, or to any other demographic disturbance, can have a dramatic impact on a group’s genetic structure. Intragroup social relationships, in turn, are likely to be infl uenced by patterns of intragroup relatedness and by the relative availability of social partners of different age or sex class (chapter 21, this volume). Thus, historical and demographic contingencies are likely to create conditions where considerable local, intrapopulation variation in social systems exists. Slight changes in ecological conditions may also contribute to variation in the behavior of individuals living in a single population over time. For example, some authors have hypothesized that howler monkey populations may undergo dramatic fluctuations in size and composition in response to several ecological factors, including resource abundance, parasite and predation pressure, and climate (Milton 1982; Crockett & Eisenberg 1986; Crockett 1996; Milton 1996; Rudran & Fernandez- Duque 2003). This variability, not only among populations, but also within populations across time highlights the need for long- term studies. In sum, our understanding of the behavior of New World monkeys has increased dramatically over the past 25 years. This understanding highlights how their behavior varies within populations over time and among populations or species across space. As our knowledge of platyrrhine behavior continues to unfold and is enriched via additional long- term studies, a central challenge will be to explain how these variations arise. It will be important to entertain adaptive explanations while acknowledging that some differences may emerge via stochastic changes in demography (Struhsaker 2008) or nongenetic, relatively short- term, nonadaptive responses to sudden ecological change...|$|E
