25|$|According to a {{spokesperson}} for the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG), the quake was felt in several mainland towns, but no damage or deaths were reported. The <b>Mentawai</b> <b>Islands</b> may have acted as a barrier, shielding the Sumatran coast by absorbing the brunt of the tsunami. As of October 30, 2010, the confirmed death toll stands at 435, with 110 more unaccounted for. Many of the missing are believed to have been swept out to sea.|$|E
25|$|The earthquake's worst {{effects were}} felt {{on the remote}} <b>Mentawai</b> <b>Islands.</b> On the island of South Pagai, the tsunami that {{followed}} the earthquake reached a height of 3m (9ft) and swept as far as 600m (1800ft) inland. According to Indonesian officials, more than 20 villages were hit by the tsunami, displacing more than 20,000 people and affecting about 4,000 households. The coastal village of Betu Monga on South Pagai {{was reported to have}} been destroyed with many residents still missing. Many residents of the villages of Peurogat and Beleerakso were also reported to be missing. Eighty percent of the houses in the North Pagai village of Muntei Baru were reported damaged or destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{examples}} of this movement appear in Maclaine Pont's design for the ceremonial halls of the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (which became Institut Teknologi Bandung). The building features an eclectic synthesis of various Indonesian local forms, including the architecture of Lake Toba, the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>islands,</b> and Sunda. The building is a striking example of innovative tropical architecture. With an elongated elevation aligned on an east-west axis, the building is provided with effective natural ventilation. This orientation also minimizes the effect of solar radiation in that the morning and afternoon sun only strikes the narrow end facades of the building. The external galleries of the building create a double facade which shield the interior from direct sunlight, while cooling towers at either end ensure good ventilation.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Mentawai</b> <b>island</b> group, due to {{relative}} remoteness, {{has been}} able to develop independently from activities on the mainland. Therefore, {{a large part of the}} population was raised on the organically developed culture and dynamic capacity of the community. This was possible due to the richly endowed environment, which includes the staple food provision in sago trees and an abundance of wildlife, including boars. The food source became an important element in the traditional believe of Arat Sabulungan, as it served as a binding agent in ritual feasts, bonding of sharing animal protein with clan members, payments to fulfil bride price requirements and traditional fines. In 1954, a compulsory introduction of state sanctioned religions was arranged. As the Mentawains acknowledge certain advanced wisdom and wealth of the sasareu or foreigners, many incentive programs made successful converts. Nevertheless, a remarkable adaptation was included; in which some layers of Mentawai identity was not lost in the conversion. In this adaptation the Islamic faith was infused with local perception.           ...|$|R
25|$|Preserved tattoos {{on ancient}} mummified human remains reveal that {{tattooing}} has been practiced {{throughout the world}} for many centuries. The Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, traditionally had facial tattoos, as did the Austroasians. Today, one can find Atayal, Seediq, Truku, and Saisiyat of Taiwan, Berbers of Tamazgha (North Africa), Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria, and Māori of New Zealand with facial tattoos. Tattooing was popular among certain ethnic groups in southern China, Polynesia, Africa, Borneo, Cambodia, Europe, Japan, the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>Islands,</b> MesoAmerica, New Zealand, North America and South America, the Philippines, Iron Age Britain, and Taiwan. In 2015, scientific re-assessment {{of the age of}} the two oldest known tattooed mummies, identified Ötzi as the oldest currently known example. This body, with 61 tattoos, was found embedded in glacial ice in the Alps, and was dated to 3,250 BC.|$|E
25|$|Surfing is also {{a popular}} water {{activity}} in Indonesia and the sites are recognised as world class. The well-known sports are mostly located on the southern, Indian Ocean side of Indonesia, for example, the large oceanic surf breaks on southern Java. However, the north coast does not receive the same surf from the Java Sea. Surf breaks can be found all the way along Sumatra, down to Nusa Tenggara, including Aceh, Bali, Banten, Java, Lombok, the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>Islands,</b> and Sumbawa. Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers are came from abroad, especially Australia and United States.

On Bali, there are about 33 surf spots, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan. In Sumbawa, Hu'u and Lakey Beach in Cempi Bay are popular surfing spots among surfing enthusiast. Sumatra is the second island, with the most number of surf spots, with 18 altogether. The common time for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds tend {{to come from the}} west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.|$|E
