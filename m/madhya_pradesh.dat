5|$|The {{depression}} brought intense monsoon {{conditions to}} Orissa, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> and Vidarbha during its life. Over 210mm (8inches) {{of rain and}} winds of 85km/h (50mph) were recorded in Paradip as the depression made landfall on June 30. Inland, the heavy rains caused some rivers in Orissa to overflow and flooded rice paddies in Cuttack District. Further west, the Wainganga River overflowed its banks in places. Road transport in <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> was disrupted and there was damage to crops in the Raipur area. Raipur recorded the highest 24-hour rains associated with the depression, with 230mm (9inches) falling there on July 2.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Rambhadracharya {{was awarded}} Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest {{civilian}} honour. Rambhadracharya has been honoured by several leaders and politicians, including A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Somnath Chatterjee, Shilendra Kumar Singh, and Indira Gandhi. Several state governments, {{including that of}} Uttar Pradesh, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> and Himachal Pradesh have conferred honours on him.|$|E
5|$|The Peshwa's {{territory}} {{was in an}} {{area called}} the Desha, {{now part of the}} modern state of Maharashtra. The region consists of the valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains. Shinde's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the Chambal, the north western region of the modern state of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from Malwa, a plateau region in the north west of the state of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> north of the Vindhya Range. Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{populations of}} nilgai in India are {{so large that}} farmers in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have pleaded to the {{government}} to cull them. Nilgai herds raid and trample crop fields across these states, often causing food shortages.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Revanta was {{popular in the}} early-mediaeval period, {{particularly}} in Rajasthan. Revanta is mostly depicted in Vaishnava and Surya temples. There is a stone inscription that talks about a temple to Revanta, as the principal deity, in Vikranapur (modern Kotgaph, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh)</b> built by the Kalachuri king Ratnadeva II.|$|E
5|$|After {{assembly}} elections {{across the}} country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland, including <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It {{was the first time the}} Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} educate people about extinct forms of life, the Geological Survey of India {{installed}} lifesize fibreglass models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office. The installation is presented in an appropriate setting, with representations of plants that existed during the Mesozoic Era. Also displayed are limb bones, vertebra, eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Orchha Fort complex, {{which houses}} {{a large number}} of ancient monuments {{consisting}} of the fort, palaces, temple and other edifices, is located in the Orchha town in the Indian state of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> The fort and other structures within it were built by the Bundela Rajputs starting from early 16th century by King Rudra Pratap Singh of the Orchha State and others who followed him.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{itself had}} minimal effects on land, but the monsoon {{advanced}} into western India in late May {{in association with}} the system. As the cyclone moved to the west away from the subcontinent, the incursion of moist air from the Arabian Sea persisted over northwestern India for the first three days of June. This brought moderate rainfall to regions of Gujarat, Rajasthan and western <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who praised the actors' portrayal {{of their respective}} characters but found the film underwhelming. A few organisations fighting {{for the rights of}} the victims of the tragedy blamed the film for presenting the facts in a distorted manner. Kumar and Sheen denied these allegations. The <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> government exempted the film from paying tax.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} storm {{of the season}} was Cyclonic Storm Hibaru, which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January. After nearly five months of inactivity, two depressions formed {{toward the end of}} June on opposite sides of India. The depression in the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year, the other of which formed in September and killed 13people. The other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26people in <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> followed by another depression in July that killed one person. A series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September; a depression killed six people in <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> Cyclonic Storm Pyarr killed 80people, an unclassified tropical storm killed 16people in nearby Bangladesh, and a deep depression in October killed 100people in Andhra Pradesh. December was active, with cyclonic storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India, resulting in 11fatalities, and a deep depression remaining over waters {{in the middle of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{complex is}} located in the Tikamgarh {{district}} of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> in the erstwhile state of Orchha. The fort complex is within an island formed by the confluence of the Betwa River and Jamni River in Orchha town. Approach to the complex from {{the eastern part of the}} market in the town is through a multiple arched bridge with 14 arches built in granite stones.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had developed over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to a depression again on July 2 over northeast <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> It degenerated into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (<b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh)</b> {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E
5|$|Maheshinte Prathikaaram release {{plans were}} {{announced}} in January 2016. The film {{was released in}} 67 theatres in Kerala on 5 February. It was released {{in the rest of}} India on 12 February, and internationally two weeks later. The film was distributed in India by OPM Dream Mill Cinemas, opening outside Kerala in Bangalore, Mysore, Mangalore, Manipal, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Vizag. On 19 February 2016, it was released in Mumbai, Pune, Gujarat, Delhi and <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya also founded an {{organisation}} called Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Viklang Seva Sangh, {{headquartered in}} Satna, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> Its {{goal is to}} create community awareness and initiate child development programmes in rural India. Its primary objective is to supplement the education programmes of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University by helping disabled children get a good education. Aid is generally given in the form of facilities which enable easier access to education. Rambhadracharya also runs a hundred-bed hospital in Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Sustained {{winds of}} 65km/h (40mph) were {{recorded}} at Sandheads on June 9, while the cyclone {{was at its}} peak offshore. High levels of rain affected much of Orissa and West Bengal, with over 100mm (4inches) falling over large areas of both states. As the storm dissipated overland, it brought severe rain to Vidarbha and southern <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> The highest recorded rainfall was at Khandwa were 280mm (11inches) fell on June 13 alone. The rains led to localised flooding in parts of Vidarbha and disrupted road transport in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Chausath Yogini Temple, Morena, {{also known}} as Ekattarso Mahadeva Temple, is an 11th century temple located in Morena {{district}} in the Indian state of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> It {{is one of the}} few such Yogini temples in the country which is in a very good condition. The temple is formed by a circular wall with 64 chambers and an open mandapa in the centre, separated by a courtyard which is circular in shape, where Shiva is deified. The temple has been declared an ancient historical monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|E
5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They are {{reportedly}} {{consumed by the}} tribal people of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> In Mexico, a large collection was consumed by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five who ate the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is Varanasi's {{second most}} {{important}} industry. Over 3 million domestic and 200,000 foreign tourists visit annually (in 2005 and 2010, respectively), most commonly for religious purposes. Most domestic tourists are from Bihar, West Bengal, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> and Uttar Pradesh, {{while the majority of}} foreign tourists are from Sri Lanka and Japan. The peak tourist season falls between October and March. In total, there are around 12,000 beds available in the city, of which about one half are in inexpensive budget hotels and one third in dharamsalas. Overall, Varanasi's tourist infrastructure is not well developed.|$|E
5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943–1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} at Baroda he contributed to many {{articles}} to Indu Prakash and spoke as a {{chairman of the}} Baroda college board. He started taking an active interest {{in the politics of}} India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> while traveling to these states. He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita. He arranged the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee (Niralamba Swami) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season, Kartik {{started in}} fine form as {{he set out}} to {{maintain}} a Test position. In the Irani Trophy, the traditional season opener between the reigning Ranji champions—Mumbai—and the Rest of India, Kartik orchestrated the demise of the title-holders. After taking 4/73 in Mumbai's 260, Kartik scored 22 in the Rest of India's 389. He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory without loss. Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> to secure his spot in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|In the Gupta period (3rd to 6th century A.D.), folk {{images of}} Matrikas became {{important}} in villages. The diverse folk goddesses {{of the soldiers}} like Matrikas were acknowledged by the Gupta rulers and their images were carved on royal monuments in order to strengthen the loyalty and adherence of the armed forces. The Gupta kings Skandagupta and Kumaragupta I (c. second half of fifth century) made Skanda (Kumara) their model and elevated the position of Skanda's foster mothers, the Matrikas from a cluster of folk goddesses to court goddesses. Since the fourth century, Parhari, <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> had a rock-cut shrine been solely devoted to the Sapta Matrika.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> during its lifespan, with rains of 140mm (5.5inches) as far west as Lucknow. The rains in Uttar Pradesh caused severe property damage and flooding, with some 150people losing {{their lives in}} the state. The Ganges flooded in northern Bihar, inundating parts of Munger District, whilst the Gandaki River flooded parts of Motihari. The rains worsened floods in south Bengal, increasing the death toll from the floods there to 80 and affecting 8million people, with considerable damage done to crops and housing. Jaleswar in Orissa was entirely flooded.|$|E
5|$|The {{general area}} of the {{composition}} of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh.</b> In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the populations}} of cheetah in India saw a drastic fall. The last {{physical}} evidence of the cheetah in India {{was thought to be}} three individuals, all shot by the Maharajah of Surguja (a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers), in 1947 in eastern <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh,</b> but a female was sighted in Koriya district, present-day Chhattisgarh, in 1951. During the early 2000s, scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs obtained from Iran. India asked Iran to transport one live pair to India, or, if that was not possible, allow them to collect sperm and eggs of the cheetah pair in Iran itself. However, Iran rejected both proposals.|$|E
5|$|This system brought {{widespread}} rains {{to a wide}} swathe of India {{during its}} existence. Some heavy rains in West Bengal flooded vast areas of many districts and resulted in some fatalities, whilst in parts of neighbouring Orissa the floodwaters damaged fields. 390mm (15inches) of rain fell on Bardhaman over two days as the depression passed overhead. Several thousand people were made homeless in West Bengal. Both the Narmada and Tapti Rivers inundated parts of <b>Madhya</b> <b>Pradesh</b> and Gujarat. The floods in Gujarat took many lives and caused severe damage to crops and other properties. Between 300 and 400people were washed away in two villages in Bharuch district. 260mm (10inches) of rain fell on Surat on July 7 and a further 80mm (3inches) on Kutch District as the cyclone moved out to sea.|$|E
