It was officially unveiled by Sony on January 27, 2011 at the PlayStation Meeting 2011. The original {{model of the}} handheld, the PCH-1000 series features a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, two analog sticks, a rear touchpad, Sixaxis <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> and a 4 core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} by Rockstar Games on March 3, 2006. Journalists noted the surprised reactions that the announcement caused within the gaming industry, which they {{owed to the}} game's significant difference when compared to Rockstar's reputation of developing mature titles. The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in Europe. On July 18, 2007, Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii, {{taking advantage of the}} <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> Wii Remote. The Wii version was released on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Uncharted {{uses the}} Cell {{microprocessor}} to generate dozens of layered character animations to portray realistic expressions and fluid movements, which allow for responsive player control. The PlayStation 3's graphics processing unit, the RSX Reality Synthesizer, employed several functions to provide graphical details that helped immerse the player {{into the game}} world: lighting models, pixel shaders, dynamic real-time shadowing, and advanced water simulation. The new hardware allowed for processes which the team had never used in PlayStation 2 game development and required them to quickly familiarize with the new techniques; for example, parallel processing and pixel shaders. While Blu-ray afforded greater storage space, the team became concerned with running out of room several times—Uncharted used more and bigger textures than previous games, and included several languages on the disc. Gameplay elements requiring <b>motion</b> <b>sensing,</b> such as throwing grenades and walking across beams, were implemented {{to take advantage of}} the Sixaxis controller. A new PlayStation 3 controller, the DualShock 3, was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, and featured force feedback vibration. Uncharted was also on display at the show with demonstrations that implemented limited support for vibration.|$|E
5000|$|Doolittle {{was also}} the first to {{recognize}} these psycho-physiological limitations of the human <b>senses</b> (particularly the <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> inputs, i.e., up, down, left, right). He initiated the study of the subtle interrelationships between the psychological effects of visual cues and <b>motion</b> <b>senses.</b> His research resulted in programs that trained pilots to read and understand navigational instruments. A pilot learned to [...] "trust his instruments," [...] not his senses, as visual cues and his <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> inputs (what he sensed and [...] "felt") could be incorrect or unreliable.|$|R
30|$|We also {{detected}} some surface cracks {{along the}} Idosawa fault in our field survey (Photo E). They {{suggest that some}} surface change did occur along the Idosawa fault as identified in the interferogram, but {{we were not able}} to infer the fault <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> and/or amount of offset from the observed cracks.|$|R
50|$|Doolittle's most {{important}} contribution to aeronautical technology was the development of instrument flying. He {{was the first to}} recognize that true operational freedom in the air could not be achieved unless pilots developed the ability to control and navigate aircraft in flight, from takeoff run to landing rollout, regardless of the range of vision from the cockpit. Doolittle was the first to envision that a pilot could be trained to use instruments to fly through fog, clouds, precipitation of all forms, darkness, or any other impediment to visibility; and in spite of the pilot's own possibly convoluted <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> inputs. Even at this early stage, the ability to control aircraft was getting beyond the <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> capability of the pilot. That is, as aircraft became faster and more maneuverable, pilots could become seriously disoriented without visual cues from outside the cockpit, because aircraft could move in ways that pilots' senses could not accurately decipher.|$|R
25|$|Mario Kart Wii takes {{advantage}} of the Wii Remotes <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> to provide intuitive and conventional steering controls; each copy of the game is bundled with the Wii Wheel accessory to augment this feature.|$|E
25|$|MEMS {{resonators}} {{are small}} electromechanical structures that vibrate at high frequencies. They {{are used for}} timing references, signal filtering, mass sensing, biological sensing, <b>motion</b> <b>sensing,</b> and other diverse applications. This article concerns their application in frequency and timing references.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, the company’s fifth Bluetooth headset, Jawbone Era was announced, {{the first}} to have a {{built-in}} accelerometer and <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> software. It functions via motion commands which involve shaking or tapping the headset twice to answer, end, or switch calls. Shaking the headset four times puts the headset in pairing mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} lateral eyes (PLE) are wide-angle <b>motion</b> detectors which <b>sense</b> <b>motions</b> {{from the}} side and behind. Combined with the other eyes, it gives the spider a near 360-degree view of the world.|$|R
50|$|L. curtus have corpuscles (scale sensillae) {{concentrated}} {{on the front of}} their head which may be a hydrodynamic receptor. A study measuring brain response to water vibration found that L. curtus is sensitive to low amplitude (100-150 Hz) water <b>motions.</b> <b>Sensing</b> water <b>motion</b> is useful in locating prey, predators, or potential mates and has been demonstrated in other aquatic animals (e.g. lateral line in fish, whiskers in harbour seals).|$|R
40|$|A flight {{instrumentation}} {{system for the}} acquisition of atmospheric turbulence data is described. Airflow direction transducers and an impact pressure transducer are the primary instruments for measuring vertical and lateral gust velocity, and a sensitive incremental pressure transducer is used to measure longitudinal gust velocity. Airplane <b>motions,</b> <b>sensed</b> by an inertial platform, are subtracted from the primary measurements during postflight data reduction to yield true gust velocity time histories. Salient engineering features of the instrumentation are discussed, and a complete description of the instrumentation is presented...|$|R
25|$|Kinect (codenamed Project Natal during development) {{was a line}} of <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> {{input devices}} by Microsoft for Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows PCs. Based around a webcam-style add-on peripheral, it enables users to control and interact with their console/computer {{without the need for}} a game controller, through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands.|$|E
25|$|Mario Kart Wii {{supports}} {{four different}} control schemes. The primary control scheme is the Wii Remote by itself, optionally {{used in conjunction}} with the plastic Wii Wheel accessory, which uses the controller's <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> to simulate operating a steering wheel. The other supported control schemes are the Wii Remote with the Nunchuk attachment; the Classic Controller; and the Nintendo GameCube controller.|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} melee attacks, and the <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> {{feature of}} the SIXAXIS controller is used {{for a number of}} things including shaking off enemies that grab onto the player, shaking off tags and flames in multiplayer, and quickly bringing up a map or leaderboard in a multiplayer match. The player also has access to turrets and a drivable jeep with a gun turret on certain levels. The game was also on Sony's list of titles to receive an online update to support the vibration {{feature of the}} DualShock 3 controller for Japan, North America, and Europe.|$|E

25|$|Three-axis MEMS-based {{gyroscopes}} {{are also}} being used in portable electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices (e.g. the iPhone) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial measurement units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available <b>motion</b> <b>sensing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote, {{also known}} colloquially as the Wiimote, {{is the primary}} {{controller}} for Nintendo's Wii console. A main feature of the Wii Remote is its <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> capability, which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing {{through the use of}} accelerometer and optical sensor technology. Another feature is its expandability through the use of attachments. The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk, which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers. Some other attachments include the Classic Controller, Wii Zapper, and the Wii Wheel, originally used for the Mario Kart Wii racing video game.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360 {{features}} an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration {{on the original}} Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, {{turning it into a}} hub for living-room computing entertainment.|$|E
50|$|Although Cicero {{had a high}} {{opinion of}} the {{knowledge}} and talent of Cratippus, his philosophical opinions are unknown, apart from allusions to his opinions on divination, on which {{he seems to have}} written a work. Cicero states that Cratippus believed in dreams and supernatural inspiration (furor) but that he rejected all other kinds of divination. He seems to have held that, while <b>motion,</b> <b>sense</b> and appetite cannot exist apart from the body, thought reaches its greatest power when most free from bodily influence, and that divination is due to the direct action of the divine mind on that part of the human soul which is not dependent on the body.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Many motions {{parameters}} can {{be measured}} and the <b>motion</b> <b>sense</b> detected based on the output signals of the rotary incremental encoder. The former method for resolution improvement supposes additional electronic circuits for detect and count {{the positive and negative}} fronts of the pulses generated by the sensor. This paper proposes an alternative method for resolution improvement and sense discrimination, adequate for the computerized study of rotary incremental encoders, using an experimental system that contains the sensor, an IBM-PC compatible computer and an intelligent interface with 80 C 552 microcontroller. Such experimental system is very useful in higher education or in research activities. Key-Words:- rotary incremental encoder, measurement, displacement, resolution, sense discrimination. ...|$|R

IGN's hands-on also cited small changes to the game such as additional motion-sensing controls using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment, and the ability to skip cutscenes, but reported no other changes in content of the game.|$|E
500|$|Joining Nintendo in {{the motion}} market, Sony Computer Entertainment {{released}} the PlayStation Move in September 2010. The PlayStation Move features <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> gaming, {{similar to that}} of the Wii. Microsoft joined the scene in November 2010, with its Kinect (previously announced under the working title [...] "Project Natal" [...] in June 2009).

40|$|In {{order to}} create a truly {{autonomous}} vehicle, the task of concurrent mapping and localization (CML) in an a priori unknown environment is an important problem. Traditionally, the task of CML has been sep-arated from the vehicle's <b>motion</b> and <b>sensing</b> strate-gies. We introduce a method for adaptive concurrent mapping and localization in unknown environments using a scanning sonar sensor. This method maxi-mizes the information gained by the next action of the robot, given the space of available actions. The viabil-ity of the approach is shown in simulation and exper-iments. Results are shown for both adaptive control of motion and adaptive control of <b>motion</b> and <b>sensing.</b> Improved performance is demonstrated in comparison to straight-line motion and random motion. ...|$|R

500|$|In 2003, the Wario {{franchise}} {{introduced a}} new series of games, the first of which was [...] for the Game Boy Advance. The game's premise involved Wario's decision to open a game development company to make money, creating short [...] "microgames" [...] instead of full-fledged games. The title's gameplay focused on playing a collection of microgames in quick succession. Mega Microgames! was later remade as [...] for the GameCube; it featured the same microgames but lacked a story mode and focused more on multi-player. In 2004, two sequels were released for the game. The first was the Game Boy Advance title , which used the cartridge's tilt sensor to allows microgames to be controlled by tilting the handheld left and right. The second was the Nintendo DS release , which incorporates the DS's touch screen and microphone in its gameplay.

500|$|Warhawk {{was first}} {{announced}} {{to the public in}} May 2005, with a working build shown at E3 in 2006. This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis <b>motion</b> <b>sensing</b> technology. In February 2007, it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled. This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single-player campaign, particularly when compared to the multi-player modes. Dylan Jobe, the game's director, stated, [...] "If we were to continue down our single-player/multiplayer approach, it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer". The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in-game communication, and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen, whereby players can easily enter split screen mid-game. Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it. Only unranked servers have the ability to have it and even then, it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off. It was also revealed {{at the same time that}} Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network.|$|E
