West Bank Palestinians deviation from the Jordanian state highlighted {{the need for a}} revision in Jordan's policy, and Jordanian nationalists began to argue that Jordan would be better off without the Palestinians and without the West Bank. Adnan Abu Oudeh, a Palestinian descendant who was Hussein's political advisor, Prime Minister Zaid Al-Rifai, army chief of staff Zaid ibn Shaker, royal court chief Marwan Kasim, and mukhabarat director Tariq Alaeddin, helped the King prepare West Bank disengagement plans. The Jordanian Ministry of Occupied Territories Affairs was abolished on 1July 1988, its responsibilities taken over by the Palestinian Affairs Department. On 28July Jordan terminated the West Bank development plan. Two days later a royal decree dissolved the House of Representatives, thereby removing West Bank representation in the Parliament. In a televised speech on 1August, Hussein announced the [...] "severing of Jordan's legal and administrative ties with the West Bank", essentially surrending claims of sovereignty over the West Bank. The move revoked the Jordanian citizenship of Palestinians in the West Bank (who had obtained it since Jordan annexed the territory in 1950), but not that of Palestinians residing in Jordan. Nevertheless, the Hashemite custodianship over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem was retained. Israeli politicians were stunned, thinking it was a political manoeuvre so that the Palestinians could show support for Hussein, but later realized that it represented a shift in Jordan's policy after Hussein asked his West Bank supporters not to issue petitions demanding that he relent. In a meeting in November 1988 the PLO accepted all United Nations resolutions and agreed to recognize Israel.|$|E
50|$|While we have {{no illusions}} about how a Kerry {{administration}} would govern — absent <b>mass</b> <b>pressure</b> from below — and are not impressed with his delayed criticism {{of the war and}} his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan’s. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as Reagan’s 1984 defeat of Mondale did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the National Negro Congress is therefore a result and a product of resistance used by the oppressed to confront the national government. Self-determination was a concept that was used as agency for protection against racism as explained in the purpose during the first National Negro Congress in February 1936: “The magnitude, complexity, and danger of the Negro’s present condition demands the mobilization of overwhelming <b>mass</b> <b>pressure</b> and force, {{which can only be}} achieve through the agency of a National Negro Congress [...]” Analyzing the current conditions of their experience in the United States allowed African Americans to realize the failings of government institutions. The main leader, A. Philip Randolph, was instrumental in gathering not only socialists and communists but was able to organize massive popular participation by African Americans. By struggling against not only racism but capitalism, the leadership under Randolph was able to forge relationships with white workers and intellectuals. Bridging race gaps among black and white workers, the notion of segregation was often challenged. Issues such as class was a way for ethnic groups to bridge some differences; what was at stake was the root of the economic and political turmoil they were placed in: capital and capitalism.|$|E

5000|$|Socialist Action {{also took}} issue with what it claimed was too little {{internal}} democracy within the Umbrella Movement, accusing the pan democratic leaders of [...] "imposing their undemocratic 'small circle' model of leadership upon protest movements in Hong Kong." [...] They called for democratic grassroots' committees {{to be set up}} inside the occupation movement and for all discussions on tactics and political demands to be conducted through such democratic structures. Socialist Action's campaign for internal democracy within the Umbrella Movement took a major turn when the leaders of the Occupy Central campaign tried to organise an online referendum inside the occupations. This followed televised talks between the Hong Kong government and student representatives on 21 October 2014. The proposed online referendum, which was initially supported by the leaders of the Federation of Students, included a question on whether to accept or reject the government's offer of a 'supplementary report' to Beijing, something many considered to be an insignificant gesture. Socialist Action campaigned vigorously against the proposed referendum saying it was a misuse of 'democracy' within the movement and a manoeuvre to call off the protests, a position that was widely reported in the Hong Kong media. The referendum was killed off by <b>mass</b> <b>pressure</b> from the occupiers, with the student leaders withdrawing their support.|$|E

After experiments with decompression, healing of fractures and pores in silicate rock samples (3 × 2 × 2 cm, 500 °C, 100 MPa) took about 800 – 1000 hours, and strength of such rocks was restored to 0. 6 – 0. 7 of the original value.
