50|$|Cation {{exchange}} capacity should {{be thought of}} as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H+) that will combine with 100 grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil (1 meq/100 g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100 grams dry soil gives a measure of one <b>milliequivalent</b> of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 <b>milliequivalent</b> = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100 grams of dry soil or 20 meq/100 g. The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{peroxide}} value {{is defined as}} the amount of peroxide oxygen per 1 kilogram of fat or oil. Traditionally this was expressed in units of milliequivalents, although if we are using SI units then the appropriate option would be in millimoles per kilogram (N.B. 1 milliequivalents = 0.5 millimole; because 1 mEq of O2 =1 mmol/2=0.5 mmol of O2, where 2 is valence). Note also that the unit of <b>milliequivalent</b> has been commonly abbreviated as mequiv or even as meq.|$|E
50|$|Alkalinity or AT {{measures}} {{the ability of}} a solution to neutralize acids to the equivalence point of carbonate or bicarbonate. The alkalinity is equal to the stoichiometric sum of the bases in solution. In the natural environment carbonate alkalinity tends to make up most of the total alkalinity due to the common occurrence and dissolution of carbonate rocks and presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Other common natural components that can contribute to alkalinity include borate, hydroxide, phosphate, silicate, dissolved ammonia, the conjugate bases of some organic acids, and sulfate. Solutions produced in a laboratory may contain a virtually limitless number of bases that contribute to alkalinity. Alkalinity is usually given in the unit mEq/L (<b>milliequivalent</b> per liter). Commercially, as in the swimming pool industry, alkalinity might also be given in parts per million of equivalent calcium carbonate (ppm CaCO3).|$|E

This plot is constructed by plotting the difference in <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage between alkaline earths and alkali metals, expressed as percentage reacting values, on the X-axis; and the difference in <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage between weak acidic anions and strong acidic anions, also expressed as percentage reacting values, on the Y-axis. The <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage differences from the X and Y co-ordinates are extended further into the main study subfields of the proposed diagram, which defines the overall character of water.

40|$|Hydrogen hectorite-water solwas {{prepared}} using mixed-bed ion-exchange r sins. At 25 ~ C, {{the rate}} of change of concentration with respect to time was determined for (a) strong-and weak-acid hydrogen ions; (b) low molecular weight, unassociated silicates; and (c) soluble, unassociated magnesium ion. The experimental data indicate that two consecutive first-order reactions are occurring: (1) strong acid is undergoing a rapid, spontaneous reaction to yield weak acid, and (2) the resulting weak acid is undergoing a slow, spontaneous reaction to yield a neutral clay. The equivalent weight of the strong acid is apparently one-half that of the weak acid. For each <b>milliequivalent</b> of strong-acid hydrogen ion undergoing reaction, one <b>milliequivalent</b> of magnesium ion is released from the crystal attice. Thus, the acid clay is eventually con-verted to magnesium clay. In addition, for each <b>milliequivalent</b> of weak-acid hydrogen ion undergoing reaction, one millimole of silica is released from the lattice. Since the release of magnesium ion precedes the release of silica, proton attack is probably occurring {{at the edges of the}} crystals. The exact nature of the weak acid is nnknown and detailed study would probably be difficult in view of its transitory existence. Freshly prepared acid heetorite contains approximately 40 meq of hydrogen ion per 100 g clay. Therefore, only 3 percent of the total magnesium is released from the lattice. The lab tice structure of the resulting magnesium clay is identical with that of natural heetorite as shown by x-ray diffraction...|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{the amount}} of a {{substance}} in equivalents often has a very small magnitude, so, especially in medicine, it is routinely {{described in terms of}} <b>milliequivalents</b> (meq or mEq, despite the correct symbol would be mequiv), the prefix milli denoting that the measure has been multiplied by 1000. Very often, the measure is used in terms of <b>milliequivalents</b> of solute per litre of solvent (or milliNormal, where meq/L = mN).

30|$|The Chadha diagram (Chadha 1999) {{was used}} to define the major water types in the areas. It is a {{modified}} version of the Piper (1944) diagram and plots the difference in <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K) expressed as percentage and plotted on the x-axis. The difference in <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the y-axis. The rectangular field resulting from this is similar to the diamond-shaped field in the Piper diagram and describes the overall character of the water. Thus, there are eight fields in the rectangular plot which represent eight different water types as in the case of Piper diagram. Those eight water types are: (1) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals; (2) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed both alkali metals and strong acidic anions, respectively (such water has temporary hardness); (6) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (such water has permanent hardness); (7) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (8) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions (Chadha 1999).|$|E

Acetylcholine caused an increase in the tissue Na+ content as compared with untreated slices; there was an approximately equivalent decrease in K+ and a significant decrease in Cl-. The calculated net intracellular concentrations of Na+, expressed as <b>milliequivalents</b> per liter of intracellular water, in unstimulated, acetylcholine-stimulated, and ouabain-treated slices were 2. 1, 3. 1, and 2. 7 times higher, respectively, than the concentration of Na+ in the bathing fluid. The net intracellular concentration of Na+, expressed as <b>milliequivalents</b> per liter of intracellular water, in slices incubated {{in the presence of}} acetylcholine was 531 mEq/liter; this is approximately the same as the concentration of Na+ in the secreted fluid of the goose salt gland (515 mEq/liter). The results indicate that the main concentration gradient for Na+ could be established across the basal membrane. The data do not indicate whether this involves active transport of Na+ per se. A second stage which might involve Na-K ATPase activity at the luminal membrane is discussed.

40|$|The Jifei {{hot spring}} emerges {{in the form}} of a spring group in the Tibet–Yunnan {{geothermal}} zone, southwest of Yunnan Province, China. The temperatures of spring waters range from 35 to 81 °C and are mainly of HCO 3 –Na·Ca type. The total discharge of the hot spring is about 10 L/s. The spring is characterized by its huge travertine terrace with an area of about 4, 000 m 2 and as many as 18 travertine cones of different sizes. The tallest travertine cone is as high as 7. 1 m. The travertine formation and evolution can be divided into three periods: travertine terrace deposition period, travertine cone formation period and death period. The hydrochemical characteristics of the Jifei hot spring was analyzed and compared with a local non-travertine hot spring and six other famous travertine springs. The results indicate that the necessary hydrochemical conditions of travertine and travertine cones deposition in the Jifei area are (1) high concentration of HCO 3 − and CO 2; (2) about 52. 9 % deep source CO 2 with significantly high PCO 2 value; (3) very high <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage of HCO 3 − (97. 4 %) with not very high <b>milliequivalent</b> percentage of Ca 2 + (24. 4 %); and (4) a large saturation index of calcite and aragonite of the hot water...|$|E

The presence of sodium, chloride and nitrate ions corroborate the minerals identified in the XRD diffractograms where halite and nitratine were identified.

40|$|Up to 80 % of {{the total}} nitrate reductase {{activity}} (NRA) determined in vivo {{in different parts of}} vegetative tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum) was located in the leaves. The NRA reached a peak when a leaf had expanded to 27 % of its final weight and 33 % of its final area. Thereafter, with advancing expansion and age of the leaf, the activity declined. This pattern of development of NRA during the ontogenesis of leaves was not influenced by raising the supply of NO 3 − from 3 to 6 <b>milliequivalent</b> per cubic decimeter in the substrate solution. The concentration of NO 3 − in leaves, stem and root was inversely related to NRA at both NO 3 − levels. Raising the supply of K+ from 1 to 6 <b>milliequivalent</b> per cubic decimeter at either concentration of NO 3 − slowed down the development of NRA in the initial stages of expansion, but promoted it subsequently. The peak of the activity which developed in a leaf of 62 % of its final area was higher at the higher supply of K+. The higher activity was maintained thereafter in the expanding and in matured and older leaves. It was concluded that NRA and the pattern of its development in expanding leaves is related to the availability of metabolites and their incorporation into enzyme proteins. Both these processes are influenced by: (a) the vertical profile of concentration of K+ in the shoot and (b) the concentration of K+ in a leaf, which depend upon its supply...|$|E
