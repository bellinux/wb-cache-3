The idea is that functional programs {{can be used in}} a <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> either to evaluate expressions or to solve constraints. The ability to solve constraints provides CFP with the novel feature of computing queries over functional programs. A constraint solver for solving CFP constraints is proposed in this paper based on the integration of the underlying constraint solvers with a complete and optimal narrowing algorithm which computes non-ground expressions. 1 Introduction To explain the philosophy of constraint functional programming, we quote the following words from Jean Piaget: [...] . the link between a "higher" (in the sense of "more complex") and a "lower" field results neither in a reduction of the first to the second nor in greater heterogeneity of the first, but in mutual assimilation such that the second explains the first, but does so b [...] ...|$|E

In a text-to-speech system, spoken utterances are automatically produced from text. This paper present a corpus-driven text-to-speech (TTS) {{system based on}} the concatenative synthesis approach. The output generated by the proposed text-to-speech synthesis system resembles natural human voice. It accepts input in two forms: manual user entry and from file (text or MS Word document). Proposed system supports <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> of output; direct to computer speakers, Wav file, or MP 3 file. Generated output can have different accent, tone based on selected languages. The proposed text-tospeech system will be implemented in C#. Net (Windows Form Application) and runs on Windows platforms.

The molecular bases of the HMG-CoAR unchanged level and lowered degradation rate in aged rats is not clear. In fact no data are available during ageing, on transcription and degradation of HMG-CoAR, so well defined in adult animal. So, aim of this work was to measure mRNA levels of the enzyme {{and the level of}} the proteins of the regulatory complex responsible of the cholesterol metabolism. To complete the picture, the level of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), SREBP cleavage activating protein, and insulin-induced gene has been measured. The levels of other related proteins, whose transcription is SREBP dependent, that is low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and Caveolin 1, have been also measured. The age-related reduced Insigs levels, joined to a reduced insulin sensitivity, could explain the decreased degradation rate of the HMG-CoAR and the increased active SREBP- 2. The SREBP- 2 in particular seems to be committed in <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> to gene transcription.

40|$|Artificial nucleases are {{designed}} for in vivo gene engineering, as the DNA cleavage performed at a specific target site enhances {{the effectiveness of the}} cell's DNA repair machinery. The therapeutic potential of the above phenomenon stems from the knowledge that (i) the shifted reading frame can be restored by non-homologous end-joining, or (ii) a DNA of erroneous sequence - causing a genetic disease - can be corrected by homologous recombination {{in the presence of a}} suitable DNA template. Besides the advantageous properties of the nowadays applied zinc finger nucleases, TALE nucleases and the CRISPR/Cas 9 system, they possess a residual citotoxicity. This is related to offtarget cleavages, which could be prevented by the strict regulation of the enzymes. The studies on enzymes acting naturally in a controlled manner are beneficial to get better insight into their mechanism. Such enzymes or their appropriate domains may be the most promising alternatives to the presently applied ones. As an example, the DNA cleavage of the inactive HNH nuclease mutants is inducible in a <b>multiple</b> <b>way.</b> This property may be used for establishing a control mechanism and thus, in combination with specific DNA-binding domains they are good candidates for the catalytic site of artificial nucleases.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{demonstrate}} how {{a notion of}} decentred subjectivity better describes marginal subject positions than the concept of unified subjectivity which depends on a discriminatory binary conceptualisation. I identify the migrant position as an aporia from which to deconstruct such concepts as unified subjectivity, as the migrant refuses classification according to dichotomous structures. I use Derridean metaphors to show the falseness and unexamined essentialism inherent in binary oppositions. I {{use a combination of}} theorists, and especially Helime Cixous, to augment my primarily Derridean reading of migrant subjectivity within the texts: The Crocodile Fury by Beth Yahp and The Mule 2 ̆ 7 s Foal by Fotini Epanomitis. Cixous 2 ̆ 7 model genders the decentred subject, and situates subjectivity as a discursive process. This theory also helps account for the notion of movement integral to migrant identity evident in the texts 2 ̆ 7 characters. I examine the importance of cultural effects on migrant subjectivity and the vital role that a recognition of the past plays for migrants, both in terms of identity construction and as a stategy of resistance to the phallocentric and Eurocentric bias of the dominant culture. Lastly, I look at the way the novels transcend binary categorisation and present a more fluid, <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> of viewing the world.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Web-based {{multimedia}} {{represents the}} presentation of instruction that involves more than one delivery media, presentation mode, and/or sensory modality. The basis {{for the use of}} multimedia is the assumption that when the user interacts within these various methods they learn more meaningfully. Recently, there has been an increase in the amount of multimedia research that is grounded in cognitive psychology. This research has begun to identify various design principles that are both theoretically grounded and educationally applicable. This session is designed to examine and provide examples of principles of effective multimedia design that are grounded in cognitive psychology. Defining Multimedia: Multimedia may be defined in <b>multiple</b> <b>way,</b> depending upon one’s perspective. Typical definitions include the following: Multimedia is the “use of multiple forms of media in a presentation ” (Schwartz & Beichner, 1999, p. 8). Multimedia is the “combined use of several media, such as movies, slides, music, and lighting, especially for the purpose of education or entertainment ” (Brooks, 1997, p. 17). Multimedia is “information in the form of graphics, audio, video, or movies. A multimedia document contains a media element other than plain text ” (Greenlaw & Hepp, 1999, p. 44). Multimedia comprises a computer program that includes “text along with {{at least one of the}} following: audio or sophisticated sound, music, video, photographs, 3 -D graphics, animation, or high-resolution graphics ” (Maddux, Johnson, & Willis, 2001, p. 253). The commonality among these definitions “involves the integration of more than one medium into some form of communication…. Most commonly, though, this term now refers to the integration of media such as text, sound, graphics, animation, video, imaging, and spatial modeling into a computer system (von Wodtke, 1993) ...|$|E

40|$|Exhibition {{spaces are}} often {{regarded}} as a communal space which situates content {{for the pleasure of}} viewing. Consistent with the current development of technology emergence in digital applications, these spaces have been affected {{in the way that the}} content and tools are now being developed in the realm of digital and virtual capacity. Exploration of new media design and aesthetics has tremendously supported the new hybrid space either conceptually or visually. The local scenario is also seeing a vast participation and interest from various domains where a large number of new inventions are designed and tailored to benefit from this multimedia diversity. Together with the shift of the situation, the built environment also faces new challenges where the physical entities are blended with digital attributes giving the users a sense of virtually participating in the space. Thus, the visual experience is also enriched when they visit these interactive exhibition spaces and able to interact with the artefacts or content in a <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> to the otherwise static and linear story telling of exhibits. This paper aims to study visual experience in visiting exhibition spaces of the new media and aesthetics. There are many factors that can be observed, analysed and used as a tool to gauge visual experience, spatial experience and interaction. Existing spaces that are available locally have the infrastructure and advantages to be created in such manner, and observations have to be done for analysis purposes. Similar research projects and method applied elsewhere to observe these spaces can be also used as an insight to understand the visual experience further. Findings from the study will benefit research in areas of visual experience, engagement and how interaction proceeds in a multimedia environment. Exhibition spaces now undergo major change from a static space to a fluid, flexible one and offer a high technological platform. This opportunity contributes aptly in time to k- owledge generation and societal well-being. The research outcome from this project will be in the form of some observation analysis on related spaces and a few case studies on related researches done. As the study is still in its infancy, more future works are envisioned to take place which includes prototype testing in the near future which will contribute to construct and design interactive exhibition space...|$|E

Not only have mAbs been used to discriminate cells during different stages of cell development, but have also assisted in understanding the dynamics of molecules expressed during functional processes. Such molecules detected on human leukocytes are called human leukocyte differentiation antigens or HLDA. In order to group the antibodies that detect similar molecules and have similar patterns of reaction, immunologists have organised the mAbs that bind to these antigens into Clusters of Differentiation (CD). So far, there are about 350 leukocyte surface molecules detected by mAbs with a CD nomenclature for human leukocytes (www. hcdm. org). In fish immunology there is a great need to produce mAbs that are able to differentiate the various components of the fish immune system to assist in the elucidation of the fish immune system. The present study was an endeavour to develop and characterise mAbs that could be accredited to such scheme. A better understanding of the fish immune system is urgently required so that effective strategies of control can be developed for significant diseases during fish farming. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by immunizing mice with thymic leukocytes from rainbow trout.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study how persons {{experience}} the influence of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) on their sexual health and their experiences of communication about sexual health, {{in order to improve}} physiotherapy within the field of rheumatology. Sexual health is an integrated part of life, and persons with Rheumatoid Arthritis, RA, often experience a decreased sexual health, which can affect their overall quality of life. RA is a chronic systematic inflammatory disease with physical, social and psychological impact on the functioning of the patient. Common symptoms of RA are pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, reduced physical capacity, and joint swelling. Symptoms during flares are complex and experienced in different ways. They can be described as multilayered symptoms affecting the whole body experience. Physiotherapy for persons with RA is usually directed towards improving activities of daily living, dealing with specific symptoms, such as pain or limited joint mobility, and it is important to widen this context to also include sexual relations. The thesis has a mixed paradigm design in a fixed multiphase model, including qualitative, quantitative and psychometric methods, in order to respond to the research question and the aims of the thesis. The first study explored the views of persons living with RA concerning sexual health in relation to physiotherapy, and covered how the body and the total life situation affected sexual health. The impact of RA was experienced as multidimensional. The findings consisted of three themes: 1) Sexual health – physical and psychological dimensions, 2) Impacts of RA and 3) Possibilities of increasing sexual health – does physiotherapy make a difference? The findings from the first study were used as a base for the questionnaire used in the second study in order to further investigate views and experiences of the impact of RA on sexual health, experiences and needs of physiotherapy in this context, as well as communication between patients and health professionals concerning sexual health. The results of the second study clarified the need to improve communication and interaction between healthcare professionals and persons with RA concerning sexual health. This was investigated in the fourth study, where the question of whether decreased sexual health can be detected with a standard outcome measurement tool was explored. In order to perform the fourth study, the Multi Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire had to be validated and tested for reliability in a Swedish context, which was performed in the third psychometric study. To conclude, sexual health is affected in different ways for persons with RA, and {{there is a lack of}} communication concerning sexual health between health professionals and persons with RA. Physiotherapists can play an active role in improving sexual health for persons with RA by being aware that pain, fatigue, decreased mobility, and level of physical capacity can affect sexual health negatively. Improvement of communication concerning sexual health between persons with RA and their partners, as well as with health professionals, may improve sexual health among persons with RA. The Swedish version of the Multi Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ-S) was found to have acceptable reliability and validity, and can be used as a base for sexual health communication since it correlates significantly with results of the Questionnaire of Sexual Health in persons with RA. The MDHAQ-S covers issues concerning sexual health in a <b>multiple</b> <b>way</b> to deepen the prerequisites for sexual health communication, but to uncover sexual health difficulties, an in-depth clinical interview or a more specific sexual health questionnaire is needed...|$|E

It was clear from FCM, microscopy and Western blot analysis that mAb TcOm 15 not only reacted with thymic cells but also with cells from other tissues. Differential staining of cells with mAb TcOm 15 was observed with 27. 1 ± 1. 4 % of leukocytes from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) stained in comparison to 2. 0 ± 0. 2 % from the thymus, 13. 8 ± 0. 4 % from the spleen, and 5. 6 ± 0. 6 % cells stained from head kidney. The labeled cells showed characteristics of lymphocytes and monocytes, presenting a distinctive staining in immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Western blot analysis, using electrophoresed proteins under denaturing conditions with leukocytes from several different tissues, showed that mAb TcOm 15 did not detect a single protein. At least three proteins appeared to be identified by the mAb at 105, 160 and 200 kDa. The proteins were identified as α Actinin- 4, non-erythroid Spectrin αII chain or Ig-like protein and non-muscle Myosin (MYH 10) by MALDI-TOF analysis. Three of these identities are for compositional molecules for the cytoskeleton of different types of cells, and one it is associated to immunoglobulin superfamily. The identification of these proteins by mAb TcOm 15 suggests an ability of this mAb to detect a specific function, possibly related with the synchronicity of expression or interaction of cytoskeleton-membrane proteins forming a multiprotein complex. Another possibility is as a carrier role for a protein during interactions. Colocalization of the mAb with F actin from the cytoskeleton was also observed suggesting the possibility that mAb TcOm 15 detects a specific site in a multi-protein complex from the cytoskeleton. The molecule detected showed down-regulation in a dose dependant way with Concanavalin A and the expression was almost lost following stimulation of cells with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate stimulation. Leukocytes from the PBL and thymus up-regulated the expression of the TcOm 15 molecule under mitogenic conditions in vitro, and results from in vivo experiments suggested the possibility of up-regulation on thymic cells. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study provide information on a potentially useful marker (mAb TcOm 15) for a cytoskeleton-membrane antigen that is modulated during stimulation of teleost lymphocytes. Additionally, this may enable insights into the relationship between cytoskeletal proteins and membrane associated immunoglobulin. Future research is necessary in order to explain this relationship and to determine the functional participation of the TcOm 15 molecule during the activation of rainbow trout cells.
