5|$|In an {{interview}} in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee {{more than any other}} character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee's appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He intended to write <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> but the timing was never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered {{over the course of the}} series, Kishimoto tends to place him towards the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.|$|E
25|$|The Jarrahids were {{mentioned}} in the sources in 1065/66, when Hassan's nephews Hazim ibn Ali and Humayd ibn Mahmud likely backed Abd al-Sharif ibn Abi'l Jann {{in his attempt to}} wrest control of Damascus from the troops of Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali. Afterward, the nephews were captured and jailed in Cairo. Their release was requested by the Fatimid general and descendant of the Hamdanids, Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, in 1066/67. Hazim had sons named Badr and Rabi'a. According to Syrian historian Mustafa A. Hiyari, information on Rabi'a in the medieval sources is confused, though he most likely was an emir of Bedouin auxiliaries for the Burid ruler of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1103–1128). Nothing <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> is {{mentioned in the}} sources, but the military activities of his sons, Mira and Fadl, are noted. His other sons were Daghfal, Thabit and Faraj.|$|E

Judah visits Simonides, who listens to his story but demands more proof of his identity. Ben-Hur says he has no proof, but asks if Simonides knows of the fate of Judah's mother and sister. He says he knows nothing and Judah leaves the house. Simonides sends his servant Malluch to spy on Judah to see if his story is true and to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Shortly afterwards, Malluch meets and befriends Judah in the Grove of Daphne, and they go to the games stadium together. There, Ben-Hur finds his old rival Messala racing one of the chariots, preparing for a tournament.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the long winter drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally feel a little over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring {{out what to do with}} Jex rather than discovering <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some great things about this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas and a guy named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel. Julian was asking Lucas {{a lot of questions about}} Peyton before she got there. She runs into Julian near the bathroom, and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Three weeks go by and Peyton still has not told Lucas the truth about her romantic history with Julian. Lucas is left to discover their past on his own, and is initially angry about it. Peyton throws a USO concert in which Angels and Airwaves, Mia, and Haley play. She continues to connect with her brother, Derek, and clash with Julian over Lucas and his film.|$|E
