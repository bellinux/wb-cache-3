5|$|Civil and {{criminal}} cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. In an uncommon case, heard at the Castellania in 1774, was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, petitioned for a sex change by wearing as a man, {{instead of the}} female clothing worn ever since born. Two <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> were appointed by the court to perform an examination. This case gives detail {{of the use of}} experts in the field, similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief (during the British period was replaced by the Chief Government Medical Officer) and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts.|$|E
5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions. The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared {{on the morning of}} the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} or kit players {{are required to}} wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of {{basic equipment}}, but players today may choose to wear it {{to protect themselves from}} head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.|$|E
40|$|Even though <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> {{systems have}} been one of the {{earliest}} and prototypical applications of expert system technology, progress in the field has been disappointingly slow. <b>Medical</b> <b>expert</b> system developers face a number of difficult challenges, in part because the process of expert system development is poorly understood (c. f. developments in software engineering), resulting in a paucity of applicable process models and methodologies. In this paper the challenges encountered by <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> system developers are conceptualised into a three-layer model, and strategies devised to overcome the above challenges are arranged into a software process model suitable for <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> system development...|$|R

5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure of the defendants to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, the defendants called a number of expert witnesses, including <b>medical</b> <b>experts.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, <b>medical</b> <b>experts,</b> and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Schwarzenegger {{was born}} with a {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade.
