5|$|A {{few months}} after the initial North American release in June 1991 for the NES, Battletoads got a Japanese-localized release for the Famicom, getting {{distributed}} in Japan by NCS, opposed to Tradewest. This release featured several gameplay tweaks, which resulted in a <b>marginally</b> easier experience.|$|E
5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to {{the interest of the}} tourist and occasional traveller, it also added <b>marginally</b> to the journey time.|$|E
5|$|Pannonian basin: From easternmost Austria through Czech Republic (small {{part in the}} southeast), Slovakia, Hungary, {{northern}} Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina (<b>marginally),</b> northern Serbia to {{the east}} of Romania and southeast of Ukraine (Transcarpathian region). This includes the middle floodplains of the Danube river and some of its tributaries, including the Drava, Sava and Tisza.|$|E
5|$|The {{body for}} coach 17 {{was built in}} 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and mounted on a steel {{underframe}} constructed by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. <b>Marginally</b> longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, {{as well as the}} brake van space.|$|E
5|$|To {{stem the}} loss of {{passengers}} and resulting deficits, the B in the early 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to the Auto Train), and onboard movies, to attract more passengers. The train was <b>marginally</b> profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August 9. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and reached the Lesser Antilles on August 15. While passing through the islands, convection greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to , though it remained disorganized. On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only <b>marginally</b> favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, <b>marginally)</b> better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} <b>marginally</b> higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Corruption is rife at all levels; Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2005 named Chad (tied with Bangladesh) as {{the most}} corrupt country in the world. Chad's ranking on the index has {{improved}} only <b>marginally</b> in recent years. Since its first inclusion on the index in 2004, Chad's best score has been 2/10 for 2011. Critics of President Déby have accused him of cronyism and tribalism.|$|E
5|$|Emerald was {{completed}} at Thomas Pitcher's dockyard in Northfleet {{at a cost}} of £14,419 and launched on 31 July 1795, twenty-seven days after Amazon. Her coppering at Woolwich was finished on 12 October 1795 and she was fitted-out at a further cost of £9,390. The Admiralty ordered a second pair of Amazon-class ships on 24 January 1795. They were <b>marginally</b> smaller at 925 tons (bm) and were built from pitch pine.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is <b>marginally</b> {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Marty was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. Forming on September 18, {{it became the}} 13th tropical storm and fourth hurricane of the year. The storm moved generally northwestward and steadily intensified despite only a <b>marginally</b> favorable environment for development, and became a Category 2 hurricane before making two landfalls on the Baja California peninsula and mainland Mexico.|$|E
5|$|India's GDP growth during January–March {{period of}} 2015 was at 7.5% {{compared}} to China's 7%, {{making it the}} fastest growing economy. During 201415, India's GDP growth recovered <b>marginally</b> to 7.3% from 6.9% in the previous fiscal. During 201415, India's services sector grew by 10.1%, manufacturing sector by 7.1% & agriculture by 0.2%. The Indian government has forecast a growth of 8.18.5% during 201516.|$|E
5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a <b>marginally</b> more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was <b>marginally</b> poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or <b>marginally</b> better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of Goofus and Gallant have {{also appeared in}} contexts divorced from the comic. Philosopher Theodore Sider used the characters in an argument against {{the notion of a}} binary Heaven or Hell conception of the afterlife. Sider conceived of Goofus and Gallant as near-equals, with Gallant only <b>marginally</b> better than Goofus, in arguing that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is antithetical to God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and Gallant as archetypes of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} October was against Southampton at Highbury. Henry who missed a penalty early on, scored to put Arsenal in {{front in the}} 67th minute. Southampton replied with two goals from Rory Delap, but Van Persie in {{stoppage}} time equalised for the home team with a curling shot. The draw meant Arsenal stood in first position and had accumulated 26 points. The team were level on points with Chelsea, with a <b>marginally</b> better goal difference.|$|E
5|$|The five {{brightest}} stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at apparent magnitude 3.8 is Alpha Apodis, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the luminosity of the Sun. <b>Marginally</b> fainter is Gamma Apodis, another ageing giant star. Delta Apodis {{is a double}} star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems {{have been found to}} have planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to have been from a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was <b>marginally</b> favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives <b>marginally</b> better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people in cities across East Germany. The East German leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the <b>marginally</b> less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|Tracking {{generally}} west-southwestward, {{the storm}} entered {{a stage of}} rapid deepening on August10, despite forecasts of an only <b>marginally</b> favorable environment. On August11, Flossie became a major hurricane, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). With cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear in its path, the hurricane weakened steadily, deteriorating to a tropical depression by August16. The storm's center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day, indicating Flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over <b>marginally</b> warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8. Around 11:00am HST (2100UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140°W.|$|E
5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only <b>marginally</b> productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only <b>marginally</b> favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better defined, and, the NHC noted that the system {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally not classified until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} {{to organize and}} deepen as the nascent depression continued west-northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. However, dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters proved deleterious to the system, and the circulation became more disorganized on October30. Despite the <b>marginally</b> favorable conditions, the overall structure improved on November1, with pronounced outflow developing along the western periphery. A nearby buoy reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed the increasing organization. At 03:00UTC on November1, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and 24hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. By that time, the agency estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph) while the storm was just 150km (95mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00UTC on November2.|$|E
5|$|Cyclonic Storm Keila (IMD designation: ARB 02, JTWC designation: 03A) was {{the first}} named storm of the 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. A weak system for much of its duration, Keila {{developed}} in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, amid an area of <b>marginally</b> favorable conditions. On November2, it briefly organized enough to be classified as a cyclonic storm, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 65km/h (40mph). Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm quickly moved ashore southern Oman near Salalah, and weakened while meandering over the country. The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November4.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was <b>marginally</b> encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although <b>marginally</b> slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only <b>marginally</b> dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and <b>marginally</b> faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases <b>marginally</b> during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{was again}} fastest in Q3, denying {{teammate}} Hamilton his fiftieth career pole {{position in the}} process. His time of 1m37.113 was more than three-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton's, ensuring he started {{from the front of}} the grid for the second race running. Valtteri Bottas confirmed his strong pace and qualified third, <b>marginally</b> ahead of Sebastian Vettel. The second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen was almost half a second behind in fifth, having made a mistake at turn 13, followed by the two Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez. Hamilton had also gone off at turn 13 on his second fast lap, preventing him from challenging Rosberg for pole position.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 1974, Oscar State, {{secretary}} general of the International Weightlifting Federation, announced that two weightlifters—North Korean Kim Joong-iI (heavyweight) and Japanese Masushi Ouchi (middle heavyweight)—had tested positive for a banned substance (stimulant) and were stripped of their medals. Kim had won three gold medals (snatch, clean & jerk and total) in the heavyweight category, while Masashi had won two gold (snatch and total) and one silver (clean & jerk) in the middle heavyweight. Kim usually competed in the middle heavyweight category, but due to being <b>marginally</b> overweight, he was forced to compete in heavyweight; after his disqualification, all three gold medals of the heavyweight category went to Houshang Kargarnejad of Iran. Snatch's gold and silver of clean & jerk of Masashi went to China's Qian Yukai and gold of total to Ali Vali of Iran.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become <b>marginally</b> favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
