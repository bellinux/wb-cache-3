Processorowned cattle feeding represents only approximately 5 %, {{where it has been}} for more than a decade. Various other forms of pricing such as carcass weight, grid, and formula represented the largest portion of purchases at 49 %. Processors indicated the two most important reasons they get involved in contracts and marketing agreements with producers is to secure higher and more consistent quality cattle. Assuring food safety was also a motivation for linking more closely with cattle producers. In the future, processors felt these motivational factors would increase in importance. As cattle feeders explore grid pricing and alliance opportunities, it is important they understand why processors desire to enter into contracts and marketing agreements...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{a problem}} in which a buyer can procure from a regular {{supplier}} {{as well as from}} a supplier in a spot market, possibly formed over the Internet. The contract with the regular supplier specifies a predetermined order volume and price, while the spot market has unlimited supply but a varying spot price. We analyse this problem from a buyer/ supplier perspective, and an analytical model is developed to analyse two distinctive procurement strategies: the pure procurement system (PS) and the <b>mixed</b> <b>procurement</b> system of regular supplier with a supplier in spot markets (MS). Without loss of generality, we obtained a closed- forms solution that enabled us to provide numerical analysis on the procurement strategies, and allowed us to compare further the different characteristics between PS and MS. The results of our analysis demonstrate that the use of spot market could effectively mitigate the risk associated with demand uncertainty facing the buyer. The results also show that adopting MS can generate a higher buyer's profit than the PS, and significant supply- chain profit improvements can indeed be achieved through buyer/ supplier coordination. Furthermore, spot price volatility leads to the facilitation of the use of spot markets, improving the buyer and the supply- chain profitability...|$|E
40|$|Many {{efforts are}} {{occurring}} {{around the world}} to improve supply chain performance to best-practice levels to improve the profitability of manufacturing and service firms. As a result, there is great interest among industry leaders and academic researchers to find ways to coordinate and streamline all of the activities in the supply procurement process as a basis for cost management, managed quality, and strategic competitiveness. With the Internet, the possibility of implementing many innovative new approaches to procurement has driven firms to want much higher performance than they currently {{seem to be able to}} achieve. Some of the innovations include dynamic market participation, spot market procurement, reverse auctions, trading agent-based searches and transaction matching, and electronic combinatorial procurement auctions. Yet the world has been slow to catch up to the high frontier of technological innovations. We observe, for example, that many interfirm relationships in procurement continue to involve long-term relationships. The institutional relationships that develop involve strong bonds between buyers and suppliers that are hard to break. In addition, we see some firms continuing to emphasize an operational and financial risk management approach in procurement that stresses cooperation for supply roll-back and overstock cost-sharing. This is so they are protected when demand destabilizes and becomes hard to estimate. Most firms base their approach on strategic logic that has been described in the now seminal research of Eric K. Clemons, Sashi Reddi and Michael Row, published in theJournal of Management Information Systems in 1993, who proposed a ‘move-to-the-middle’ theory. The essence of their theory is that most interfirm procurement arrangements are typically made between the extremes of high-risk, unified, single-supplier relationship-based procurement, and high-cost, diversified, many-supplier market-based procurement. Thus, when we consider this perspective, it is easy to come to the conclusion that a technological innovation may not go a long way. Instead, the new approaches will need to be not just innovative, but also need to reflect the true complexity of decision-making in supply chain management settings and deliver measurable benefits. Special section: Supply Chain Trading Agent ResearchThe premise of this special issue is that the static quality of most firms’ supply chains, and their reliance on long-term firm-to-firm relationships diminishes the opportunity for them to achieve value-maximizing buyer–seller procurement transactions in the presence of price, product, service, vendor and market changes. The special issue editors, John Collins and Norman Sadeh, suggest that seeking solutions to achieve the transformation of a firm’s supply chain to a more dynamic process has been very challenging though. This occurs, in part, due to the complexity of interfirm relationships, long-established contracts, and implicit assurances about the handling of incomplete contracting issues (e. g., quality problems, short-notice orders, supplier tier relationship management, etc.) that have developed around the supply chain activities of large organizations. One potentially interesting approach, they observe, can be based on the idea of letting the technology take charge. The guest editors and some of the authors of articles in this special section have been leaders over the years in the Internet-based ‘Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management’ (TAC-SCM), which was established by the e-Supply Chain Management Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science. The competition focuses on the construction of trading agent approaches that permit computers to make decisions about a PC manufacturer scenario based on the sourcing of components, the manufacturing of PCs, and their sale to customers. The home page of TAC-SCM reports that the competition was designed to promote and encourage high quality research on the design, application and evaluation of autonomous trading agent technologies. The special section articles that follow explore competition for the evaluation of <b>mixed</b> <b>procurement</b> strategies in agent-based supply chain trading, coordinated selection of supply chain bids, flexibility in control over agent-based decision-making, and the interaction between the forecasting of market prices for supplies and supply chain decision-making. Although we will leave it to the guest editors to provide more detailed descriptions of each of the four articles contained in the special section, we have a number of observations on this interesting research to share with the reader. First, the strong interdisciplinary nature of these research works reflects the complexity of supply chain management decision-making with technology, and they set ‘the bar’ high for the creation of new knowledge and strong research contributions to this journal. Second, each of the papers in different ways emphasizes the importance of modeling and analysis of the supply chain management setting, as well as the design of novel technology artifacts (in this case, algorithms, agent software, and decision support systems) that are aimed at improving decision performance. Operations research and mathematical approaches play an important role, for example, as does the design of algorithmic and heuristic solution approaches. Third, all of the papers illustrate solution approaches to different aspects of the supply chain management process, including forecasting prices, coordination of procurement bid, the implementation of <b>mixed</b> <b>procurement</b> strategies, and the benefits of decision control flexibility. Final commentsWe would like to take this opportunity to thank John Collins and Norman Sadeh for their continuing service to the interdisciplinary technology research community, their commitment to this journal, and the unique research contributions that they have brought together for the Special Section on Supply Chain Trading Agent Research. We also would like to thank the reviewers who contributed their time and insights on the Special Section papers...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 the {{gundrilling}} oil used at Honeywell FM&T (Federal Manufacturing and Technology) {{was known}} as 50 - 50. This name was selected because the oil {{is a mixture of}} two machining oils, Milpro 634 and Pennex N 47. Unfortunately, Honeywell FM&T was notified that one component, Pennex N 47, would be discontinued by the manufacturer. At this point the Honeywell FM&T team decided to select a single oil to eliminate <b>mixing</b> and <b>procurement</b> of two products. In addition, the team also wanted to select new oil with lower viscosity than the 50 - 50 mixture. Lower (than 50 - 50) viscosity oil was recommended by Nagel the manufacturer of the new TBT gundrilling machines. To this end Honeywell FM&T evaluated seven cutting oils in order to select a substitute that would achieve acceptable gundrilling results. This work resulted in the selection of Castrol Ilocut 334 based on cutting performance and human factors. The Castrol oil can easily achieve up to 8 holes per drill at a feed rate 30 % greater than that achieved by the 50 - 50 oil. Once design agency approval is received, this oil will be installed as the drilling oil for all FM&T stems. This oil will also be used for other reservoir machining operations where appropriate...|$|R

Despite the numerous constraining issues and problems the industry has to deal with, exploration and production technologies have continued to improve in leaps and bounds with more land and seabeds being explored for their valued commodity. However, there appears to have been little development to move away from traditional approaches into a more innovative procurement strategies in {{the oil and gas}} industry. This is perhaps because there are relatively few major players, that is project initiators (clients/owners) and implementers (contractors), in the oil and gas sector.

40|$|This audit {{identified}} {{gaps and}} inconsistencies in Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s approach to identifying projects {{to be subject}} to High Value High Risk (HVHR) review, and the need for improved management of the process. Overview The Victorian government adopted the High Value High Risk (HVHR) process in late 2010 because of past cost overruns of over 2  billion attributed to inadequate management of project business cases and procurements. The process covers all public sector infrastructure and information and communications technology investments that are likely to draw on Budget funding and are over 100 million or assessed as high risk. The goal of the HVHR process is to achieve more certainty in the delivery of intended benefits, in line with planned costs and time lines, through extra scrutiny by the Department of Treasury and Finance (DTF), together with additional Treasurer 2 ̆ 7 s approvals at key milestones covering the business case, procurement and monitoring after the procurement decision. DTF 2 ̆ 7 s increased scrutiny through the HVHR process has made a difference {{to the quality of the}} business cases and procurements underpinning government 2 ̆ 7 s infrastructure investments. However, these improvements have not lifted practices so that they consistently and comprehensively meet DTF 2 ̆ 7 s better practice guidelines. This means government is still exposed to the risk that projects fail to deliver intended benefits on time and within approved budgets. A robust HVHR process is critical to effectively managing this risk. DTF 2 ̆ 7 s scrutiny of HVHR projects was best in relation to project costs, time lines and agencies 2 ̆ 7 approaches to risk management.  The quality of scrutiny applied was more <b>mixed</b> for <b>procurement,</b> governance and project management and clearly inadequate when providing assurance about the expected project benefits. None of the business cases examined in the audit adequately justified the benefits of the respective projects. The audit identified gaps and inconsistencies in DTF 2 ̆ 7 s approach to identifying projects {{to be subject to}} HVHR review, and the need for improved management of the process. In addition, DTF is yet to evaluate the impacts of the HVHR process on project outcomes. The VicRoads RandL registration and licensing system project is the type of complex project that HVHR is meant to deal with and an example where significant negative deliverability risks have materialised. While the project commenced well before the HVHR process was introduced, it has been monitored through HVHR since late 2011. The government has now paused the project until February 2015.  RandL is currently running at least 18 months late, has cost around 102  million and VicRoads has proposed additional expenditure of up to 135  million more than the approved budget of 158 million...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 98 - 101). This thesis {{has been designed to}} validate a professional finding for the Third sector while the researcher worked in BRAC as Head of Procurement from 2007 to 2014. The proposal is to carry out an inquisition whether a mixed structure of centralized and decentralized procurement i. e. hybrid structure could be ideal for a large Third sector organization like that of BRAC. In line with this inquiry, the literature review has been carried out first to see what really is meant by the Third Sector. After determining the same, the researcher has delved into the arena of literature review where he has tried to determine which structures are currently being applied and what the current practices of procurement for all three sectors were. Furthermore, the researcher has elaborated various facets of centralized, decentralized and <b>mixed</b> or hybrid <b>procurement</b> structures with specific reference to the Third Sector. In the hybrid segment the four available types, such as Strategically Controlled Action Network (SCAN), Centre Led Action Network (CLAN), Devolved procurement e. g. the Lead Buyer System and Partnering, have also been focused. It is deduced from the review that hybrid structure {{depending on the type of}} purchases could be ideal for a large Third Sector Organization like BRAC that is spread over continents. To further validate the finding, the researcher also carried out surveys though primary data collection. A population of 50 highly qualified procurement professionals was selected from the three sectors for responding to the questionnaire out of which 44 professionals responded. The professionals have the experience of working mostly in the upper level of the procurement function and have risen to their respective positions from the functional level to the strategic level having grasp of the issues involved with designing or streamlining the structure of all three sectors including the Third Sector. As many as 27 questions were framed ranging from the demographic data of the respondents to centralized/decentralized structure and then the hybrid structure. In the survey, Strategically Controlled Action Network (SCAN) hybrid system obtained overwhelming support from 61. 4 % respondents, Centre Led Action Network (CLAN) hybrid system got 25 %, the partnering 11. 4 % and the Lead Buyer System secured no following. It speaks volumes in support of the thesis that SCAN hybrid system would be ideal for a dispersed organization like BRAC and to a lesser degree CLAN system could be applicable to the Third Sector Organizations where devolvement to the division level is required for meeting the local requirement.
