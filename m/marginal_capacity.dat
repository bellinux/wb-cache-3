Taking the loss of load probability (LOLP) design criterion as an example, we establish this conclusion formally, and suggest an algorithm to apportion accurately <b>marginal</b> <b>capacity</b> costs to various periods.

Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 31 (2), 261 - 265. Retrieved from ://WOS: 000353671300011 Many irrigators in the Central Great Plains region {{do not use}} {{science-based}} irrigation scheduling for {{a variety}} of reasons, many of which are not strongly related to the technical feasibility. Evapotranspiration (ET) -based irrigation scheduling {{has been shown to be}} an acceptable irrigation scheduling method within the region. Many irrigators have expressed the rationale that there is no need to implement irrigation scheduling because their <b>marginal</b> <b>capacity</b> irrigation must be ran continually throughout the season to meet corn irrigation needs. ET-based irrigation schedules were simulated using 43 years (1972 - 2014) of weather data for Colby, Kansas, to determine irrigation needs as affected by irrigation capacity, center pivot sprinkler system application efficiency and the initial soil water condition at corn emergence. Adoption of ET-based irrigation scheduling with an initial soil water condition of 85 % of field capacity and 95 % application efficiency potentially could save on average 212 mm of water for a 25. 4 mm/ 4 days irrigation capacity and 71 mm for a severely deficit 25. 4 mm/ 8 day irrigation capacity. As application efficiency was decreased from 95 % to 80 % these savings for similar initial soil water conditions decreased from 176 to 67 mm for the greater and smaller irrigation capacities, respectively. Potential irrigation savings using an application efficiency of 95 % were reduced but still appreciable when the initial soil water condition was 60 % of field capacity averaging 154 and 25 mm for the 25. 4 mm every 4 or 8 days irrigation capacities, respectively. Irrigators with <b>marginal</b> <b>capacity</b> systems should adopt science-based irrigation scheduling to make best use of their limited irrigation and should not discount their opportunity to save irrigation water even when their system restrictions are severe...|$|E

The case of dependent demands, a heretofore unsolved problem, is handled using the line-integral calculus. Several specific models are analyzed, with both capacity constraints and profit constraints being considered. In some models it is shown that prices should depend on marginal operating costs but not on <b>marginal</b> <b>capacity</b> costs. Trade-offs between these marginal costs are explored in the peak-load pricing context. In other models the relationships of price with both demand elasticities and marginal costs are developed.

In {{this form of}} control bid, prices are attached to resources, and a product is offered if the revenue derived from it exceeds {{the sum of the}} bid prices of its consumed resources. This approach is appealing because once bid prices have been determined, it is fairly simple to derive the products that should be offered. Yet it is still unknown how well a bid price control actually performs. Recently, considerable progress has been made with network revenue management by incorporating customer purchase behavior via discrete choice models. However, the majority of authors have presented control policies for the booking process that are expressed in terms of which combination of products to offer at a given point in time and given resource inventories. The recommended combination of products as identified by these policies might not be representable through bid price control.
