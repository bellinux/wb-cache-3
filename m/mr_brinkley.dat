60|$|The ladies were in {{a scream}} of {{laughter}} as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> lumbered heavily to their group.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> made an inarticulate noise for comment, {{and assumed}} the contemptuous sneer which some men find {{convenient}} for shaving the lower lip.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Mavering!" [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> {{coming up}} and taking his hand into his fat grasp. [...] "On your way to Fortress Monroe? Better come with us. Why; Munt!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't {{go on in}} the dark," [...] {{retorted}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "You can't {{think in}} the dark, much less talk! Can you, Mrs. Pasmer?" [...] Mrs. Pasmer, with Alice next to her, sat just in front of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{went out}} upon the seaward {{verandah}} {{of the hotel}} with this bitterness of Mrs. Pasmer's smile in her thoughts; and it disposed her to feel more keenly the quality of Miss Pasmer's smile. She found the girl standing there at a remote point of that long stretch of planking, and {{looking out over the}} water; she held with both hands across her breast the soft chuddah shawl which the wind caught and fluttered away from her waist. She was alone, said as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley's</b> compunctions goaded her nearer, she fancied that the saw Alice master a primary dislike in her face, and put on a look of pathetic propitiation. She did not come forward to meet <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> who liked better her waiting to be approached; but she smiled gratefully when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> put out her hand, and she took it with a very cold one.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Cotton was so {{bewildered by}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley's</b> {{interpretation}} of Alice's latent motives that {{she let the}} truculent hostility of her aspiration pass unheeded. She looked helplessly about, and seemed faint, so that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> without appearing to notice her state, interposed {{the question of a}} little sherry. When it had been brought, and Miss Cotton had sipped the glass that trembled in one hand while her emotion shattered a biscuit with the other, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> went on: [...] "I'm glad the engagement is broken, and I hope it will never be mended. If what you tell me of her reason for breaking it is true--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't {{that rather}} a theory?" [...] asked <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> finding such {{opportunities}} for conversation as he could. [...] "I dare say Mrs. Pasmer {{would be very}} glad to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{had entered}} upon a very {{difficult}} spot {{at the corner of}} his left jaw. He finished it before he said, [...] "I don't see anything awful about it, so long as Pasmer hasn't come too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and quite}} {{right to do}} it," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley. [...] "I don't know {{that we should be}} very proud {{ourselves}} if we confessed just what caught our fancy in our husbands. For my part I shouldn't like to say how much a light hat that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> happened to be wearing {{had to do with the}} matter." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{hastened to}} make the mention of Miss Anderson as impersonal as possible.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> felt bound, of course, {{since there}} was no open enmity between them, to meet the Pasmers on the neutral ground of the Hygeia with {{conventional}} amiability. She was really touched by the absent wanness of the girls look, and by the later-coming recognition which shaped her mouth into a pathetic snide. Alice did not look like death quite, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had told her husband, with the necessity her sex has for putting its superlatives before its positives; but she was pale and thin, and she moved with a languid step when they all met at night after <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had kept out of the Pasmers' way during the day.|$|R
60|$|All {{the ladies}} {{joined in the}} laugh with which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> herself led off. But Miss Cotton stopped {{laughing}} first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mrs. Brinkley," [...] {{said one}} of the ladies, [...] "it would be of no use for you to preach broken engagements to any one who saw you and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> together." [...] They fell upon her, one after another, and mocked her with the {{difference}} between her doctrine and practice; and they were all the more against her because they had been perhaps a little put down by her whimsical sayings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I took {{a notion}} {{to come right}} on after I wrote, and I started on the same train with it. But {{they said it was}} no use {{trying to get into the}} Hygeia, and I stopped last night at the little hotel in Hampton. I've just walked over, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> told me you were out here somewhere. That's the whole story, I believe." [...] He gave his nervous laugh, but it seemed to Mrs. Brinkley that it had not much joy in it.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sure}} that the Pasmers wished to have the affair on again, and part of her fascination with a girl whom she neither liked nor {{approved}} was her belief that Alice's health had broken under the strain of her regrets and her despair. She did not get better from the change of air; she grew more listless and languid, and more dependent upon Mrs. Brinkley's chary sympathy. The older woman asked herself again and again what made the girl cling to her? Was she going to ask her finally to intercede with Dan? or was it really a despairing atonement to him, the most disagreeable sacrifice she could offer, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had stupidly suggested? She believed that Alice's selfishness and morbid sentiment were equal to either.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> was {{certainly}} amused at this. [...] "It {{seems to me}} that there you've been anticipated by nature--not to mention art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be dear to nature, and to nature's children," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "Perhaps because their digestions are strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Van Hook stopped, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> said, [...] "And yet {{she always}} seemed to me {{particularly}} practical and level-headed--as the men say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley, [...] "and that's {{what makes}} the whole thing so {{perfectly}} ridiculous. Just think of two children, one of twenty and the other of twenty-three, proposing to decide their lifelong destiny in such a vital matter! Should we trust their judgment {{in regard to the}} smallest business affair? Of course not. They're babes in arms, morally and mentally speaking. People haven't the data for being wisely in love till they've reached the age when they haven't the least wish to be so. Oh, I suppose I thought that I was a grown woman too when I was twenty; I can look back and see that I did; and, what's more preposterous still, I thought <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> was a man at twenty-four. But we were no more fit to accept or reject each other at that infantile period--" ...|$|E
6000|$|People came to {{the first}} of Mrs. James Bellingham's receptions with the {{expectation}} of pleasure which the earlier receptions of the season awaken even in the oldest and wisest. But they tried to dissemble their eagerness in a fashionable tardiness. [...] "We get later and later," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley to John Munt, as she sat watching the slow gathering of the crowd. By half-past eleven it had not yet hidden Mrs. Bellingham, where she stood near {{the middle of the}} room, from the pleasant corner they had found after accidentally arriving together. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had not come; he said he might not be too old for receptions, but he was too good; in either case he preferred to stay at home. [...] "We used to come at nine o'clock, and now we come at I'm getting into a quotation from Mother Goose, I think." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{day after}} Brinkley's article appeared, Theroux stated that [...] "our final year-end records {{do not agree}} with the numbers he had been {{provided}} by his source" [...] and claimed that at the media conference he had stated that the Microsoft funding amounted to 7%. [...] "It now appears the final figure is about 8%, a statistically insignificant difference, and far less than the 20% figure <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> claimed in his article," [...] said Theroux.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{we have so}} far," [...] he {{answered}} modestly; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> laughed with him. This was the first entertainment at Trevor cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, quite," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> {{with a short}} breath, and {{not knowing}} whither this tended. Alice did not leave her in doubt.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had theorised Alice Pasmer {{as simply}} and primitively selfish, {{like the rest}} of the Pasmers in whom the family traits prevailed.|$|R

60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{looked at}} him for an instant as if she really thought him capable of it. Then she joined him in his laugh.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> disappointedly. [...] "I {{think the}} sudden {{departure}} of the Van Hooks must {{have had something to}} do with Dan Mavering." ...|$|R
