5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After <b>mixing,</b> <b>it</b> is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including the flavors, tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or licorice, kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds in water for many hours, then straining, sweetening and <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried apricots boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands, {{liquorice}} confectionery (drop) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. <b>Mixing</b> <b>it</b> with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is quite popular. <b>Mixing</b> <b>it</b> with ammonium chloride (salmiak) is also popular. A popular liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop (salty liquorice), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride. The salty taste is due to ammonium chloride. Strong, salty sweets are also popular in Nordic countries.|$|E

The mixing {{can be carried out}} by pumping the binder into the soil whilst <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with a device normally mounted on an excavator or by excavating the masses, mixing them separately with the binders and refilling them in the desired area. The technique can also be used on lightly contaminated masses as a means of binding contaminants, as opposed to excavating them and transporting to landfill or processing.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rubber {{was made}} from latex of the rubber tree (Castilla elastica), which is {{indigenous}} to the tropical areas of southern Mexico and Central America. The latex was made into rubber by <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with the juice of what was likely Ipomoea alba (a species of morning glory), a process which preceded Goodyear's vulcanization by several millennia. The resultant rubber would then be formed into rubber strips, which would be wound around a solid rubber core to build the ball.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, IVF {{could be}} {{performed}} by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with sperm, and reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include ovarian hyperstimulation to generate multiple eggs or ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval directly from the ovaries; after which the ova and sperm are prepared, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before embryo transfer into a uterus.|$|E

25|$|Moisture must be {{maintained}} above 50%, lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70-90%, with a suggested content of 70-80% for vermicomposting-oriented vermiculture operations. If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> in well.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} feces produced, and its {{character}} can be helpful, although as changes often occur relatively distant to the anus, changes {{may not be}} seen for some time. In areas where sand colic {{is known to be}} common, or if the history suggests it may be a possibility, faeces can be examined for the presence of sand, often by <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> in water and allowing the sand to settle out over 20 minutes. However, sand is sometimes present in a normal horse's feces, so the quantity of sand present must be assessed. Testing the feces for parasite load may also help diagnose colic secondary to parasitic infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (<b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E

To build the actual comb, saliva {{is used as a}} cement to piece together organic and inorganic materials that are readily available to the colony. This cement not only holds together the comb, but also protects the comb from being damaged by water. It provides a protective barrier to help protect the colony from wind or other harsh weather conditions. Available resources, location, and amount of mastication affect the final nest's appearance, so much variation is seen among the nests of V. crabro.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Church of the East uses leavened {{bread for}} Eucharist, like most churches of Eastern Christianity, {{but it is}} the only Church to include the {{additional}} ingredient of Holy Leaven. Holy Leaven is a powder added to sacramental bread before it is baked. Despite the name, Holy Leaven does not actually contain a leavening agent. Instead, khmira, fermented dough from previously used sacramental bread, is added and acts as leaven. What the Holy Leaven does contain is remainder from the original Holy Leaven, renewed annually by <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with common ingredients. The original Holy Leaven is said to contain residue from the original bread used at the Last Supper, mixed with the blood of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|In the 2nd century, Numenius of Apamea {{sought to}} fuse {{additional}} elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, a direction which Plotinus continued, forming neoplatonism, a religion of theistic monism. Neoplatonism {{began to be}} adopted by prominent scholars such as the Christian theologian Origen and the anti-Christian Porphyry. During the rule of Gallienus, the imperial family themselves gave patronage to Plotinus, and encouraged his philosophical activities. Neoplatonism was further developed by Iamblichus, who believed that physical invocations {{would be able to}} produce soteriological results, and therefore added religious ritual to the philosophy. Emperor Julian tried to unify traditional Roman religion by <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with Iamblichus' form of neoplatonism; the influential Christian thinker Augustine of Hippo lived during this period, and his subsequent writings show heavy neoplatonic influence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{much of the}} buff china service was {{collected}} by Admiral Francis W. Dickins, a noted collector of porcelain. He misattributed this china to the administration of James Monroe, an error which was perpetuated by scholars and nonexperts alike for many years. Individual collectors often misidentify this china as also having come from the Monroe administration. The White House, too, often misattributed the china, <b>mixing</b> <b>it</b> with buff banded china ordered during the Grant administration. This problem with the White House china collection was rectified in 1958. Mamie Eisenhower, a fan of beautiful china, asked the Smithsonian Institution to assist her in researching and cataloguing correctly the White House china collection. This led to the correct identification of the buff band china with the Lincoln administration.|$|E
