For example, after sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has released its hydrogen and has been oxidized, the product is NaBO2 (sodium <b>metaborate).</b> Sodium <b>metaborate</b> might be hydrogenated back into sodium borohydride fuel by several different techniques, some of which might theoretically require nothing more than water and electricity or heat. However, these techniques are still in active development. As of June 30, 2010, many patents claiming to effectively achieve the conversion of sodium <b>metaborate</b> to sodium borohydride have been investigated but none have been confirmed—the current efficiency of [...] "boron hydride recycling" [...] seems to be well below 1% which is unsuitable for recharging a vehicle.|$|E

40|$|To address {{high fire}} risks of {{flamable}} cellulosic materials, that can trigger easy combustion, flame propagation, and release of toxic gases, we report a new fire-retardant approach using synergetic actions combining unique properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and hydrated-sodium <b>metaborates</b> (SMB). The single-step treatment {{of cellulosic materials}} by a composite suspension of rGO/SMB was developed to create a barrier layer on sawdust surface providing highly effective fire retardant protection with multiple modes of action. These performances are designed considering synergy between properties of hydrated-SMB crystals working as chemical heat-sink {{to slow down the}} thermal degradation of the cellulosic particles and gas impermeable rGO layers that prevents access of oxygen and the release of toxic volatiles. The rGO outer layer also creates a thermal and physical barrier by donating carbon between the flame and unburnt wood particles. The fire-retardant performance of developed graphene-borate composite and mechanism of fire protection are demonstrated by testing of different forms of cellulosic materials such as pine sawdust, particle-board, and fiber-based structures. Results revealed their outstanding self-extinguishing behavior with significant resistance to release of toxic and flammable volatiles suggesting rGO/SMB to be suitable alternative to the conventional toxic halogenated flame-retardant materials.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} energy necessitates nuclear power units to {{increase}} power limits. This implies {{significant changes in}} the design of the core of the nuclear power units, therefore providing better performance and safety in operations. A major hindrance to the increase of nuclear reactor performance especially in Pressurized Deionized water Reactors (PWR) is Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) [...] the unexpected change in the core axial power distribution during operation from the predicted distribution. This problem is thought to be occur because of precipitation and deposition of lithiated compounds like boric acid (H{sub 2 }BO{sub 3 }) and lithium <b>metaborate</b> (LiBO{sub 2 }) on the fuel rod cladding. Deposited boron absorbs neutrons thereby affecting the total power distribution inside the reactor. AOA is thought to occur when there is sufficient build-up of crud deposits on the cladding during subcooled nucleate boiling. Predicting AOA is difficult as there is very little information regarding the heat and mass transfer during subcooled nucleate boiling. An experimental investigation was conducted to study the heat transfer characteristics during subcooled nucleate boiling at prototypical PWR conditions. Pool boiling tests were conducted with varying concentrations of lithium <b>metaborate</b> (LiBO{sub 2 }) and boric acid (H{sub 2 }BO{sub 3 }) solutions in deionized water. The experimental data collected includes the effect of coolant concentration, subcooling, system pressure and heat flux on pool the boiling heat transfer coefficient. The analysis of particulate deposits formed on the fuel cladding surface during subcooled nucleate boiling was also performed. The results indicate that the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient degrades in the presence of boric acid and lithium <b>metaborate</b> compared to pure deionized water due to lesser nucleation. The pool boiling heat transfer coefficients decreased by about 24 % for 5000 ppm concentrated boric acid solution and by 27 % for 5000 ppm lithium <b>metaborate</b> solution respectively at the saturation temperature for 1000 psi (68. 9 bar) coolant pressure. Boiling tests also revealed the formation of fine deposits of boron and lithium on the cladding surface which degraded the heat transfer rates. The boron and lithium <b>metaborate</b> precipitates after a 5 day test at 5000 ppm concentration and 1000 psi (68. 9 bar) operating pressure reduced the heat transfer rate 21 % and 30 %, respectively for the two solutions...|$|E

By comparing calculations with experiments, the structures of these clusters and their corresponding neutrals were assigned, and their structural evolutions were revealed. During the anionic structural evolution with n increasing to 5, hydroxyborate and <b>metaborate</b> channels were identified and the <b>metaborate</b> channel is more favorable. For the hydroxyborate structures, the anionic Li+-BO 2 - ion pair reacts with a water molecule to produce the LiBO(OH) (2) (-) moiety and three water molecules tend to dissolve this moiety. In the <b>metaborate</b> channel, two types of solvent-separated ion pair (SSIP) geometries were determined as the ring-type and linear-type. The transition from the contact ion pair (CIP) to the ring-type of SSIP starts at n = 3, while that to the linear-type of SSIP occurs at n = 4. In neutral LiBO 2 (H 2 O) n clusters, the first water molecule prefers to react with the Li+-BO 2 - ion pair to generate the LiBO(OH) (2) moiety, analogous to the bulk crystal phase of alpha-LiBO 2 with two O atoms substituted by two OH groups. The Li-O distance in the LiBO(OH) (2) moiety increases with {{the increasing number of}} water molecules and elongates abruptly at n = 4.
