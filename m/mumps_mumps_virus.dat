40|$|Three hundred nine {{mumps virus}} (MuV) strains {{detected}} in the United Kingdom during 1995 – 2002 were characterized by partial sequencing of the small hydrophobic gene and were shown to belong to at least 6 different genotypes. A strain representing a new genotype was isolated from a seminal fluid specimen. Identical strains belonging to genotypes G and C were found to circulate for up to 3 years. One genotype H strain reappeared after an absence of 4 years. Distinct lineages (G 1 –G 7) within genotype G were recognizable in the present study, and this level of characterization proved to be very useful for tracking MuV importations and subsequent transmission. We propose, here, a preliminary standardization of international nomenclature for genetic characterization of MuV strains, to facilitate future molecular epidemiological studies of mumps. Oral fluid (OF) specimens () were used to detect both anti-MuV IgM and MuV genome, and the resultsnp 1441 indicate that OF specimens can be used successfully for diagnosis and {{have the potential to}} play a valuable role in diagnosis and surveillance of <b>mumps.</b> <b>Mumps</b> <b>virus</b> (MuV) is a single-strand negative-sense RNA virus of family Paramyxoviridae.

40|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of widespread vaccination programs, <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> was the leading cause of virus-induced central nervous system (CNS) disease. Mumps virus-associated CNS complications in vaccinees continue to be reported; outside the United States, some of these complications have been attributed to vaccination with insufficiently attenuated neurovirulent vaccine strains. The development of potentially neurovirulent, live, attenuated <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines stems largely from the lack of an animal model that can reliably predict the neurovirulence of <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine candidates in humans. The lack of an effective safety test with which to measure <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> neurovirulence has also hindered analysis of the neuropathogenesis of <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> infection and the identification of molecular determinants of neurovirulence. In this report we show, for the first time, that <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> infection of the neonatal rat leads to developmental abnormalities in the cerebellum due to cerebellar granule cell migration defects.

The <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> RT–n-PCR was capable of detecting 0. 001 PFU/ml and 0. 005 50 % tissue culture infective dose/ml. This method was found to be specific, since no PCR product was detected in each of the CSF samples from patients with proven non-mumps virus-related meningitis or encephalitis.

40|$|In recent years, <b>mumps</b> {{outbreaks}} {{have been}} reported in several countries with high vaccination coverage rates. In this review, possible immunological mechanisms involved in <b>mumps</b> vaccine failure are discussed. Because not much is known about these immunological mechanisms, some mechanisms that are activated during exposure to other paramyxoviruses, including the measles virus, are proposed to play a role during <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> exposure as well. Besides the V protein that interferes with IFN and IL- 6 signaling, polymorphisms in cytokines, cytokine receptors and HLA have been described in literature. Additionally, the HN and SH <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> proteins seem to be responsible for differences in pathogenicity and virulence between genotypes. Furthermore, {{it is likely that the}} same TLRs activated upon measles virus exposure are triggered by the <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> as well. Based on similarities in virus structures, it is likely that the SLAM, DC-SIGN and nectin- 4 receptors, which play a role in measles virus infection and vaccination, are involved in the immunological response upon <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> vaccination or infection. Because TRAF 6 and TAK 1 are crucial molecules in both the TLR 3 and IL- 1 pathways, it might be that these molecules are also important in infection with <b>mumps</b> <b>virus.</b> However, there are also important differences between measles and <b>mumps</b> <b>virus,</b> including the lack of neuraminidase activity in measles virus.

40|$|Mumps {{virus is}} a common {{infectious}} agent of humans, causing parotitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and orchitis. Like other paramyxoviruses in the genus Rubulavirus, <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> catalyzes the proteasomal degradation of cellular STAT 1 protein, a means for escaping antiviral responses initiated by alpha/beta and gamma interferons. We demonstrate that <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> also eliminates cellular STAT 3, a protein that mediates transcriptional responses to cytokines, growth factors, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, {{and a variety of}} oncogenic stimuli. STAT 1 and STAT 3 are independently targeted by a single <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> protein, called V, that assembles STAT-directed ubiquitylation complexes from cellular components, including STAT 1, STAT 2, STAT 3, DDB 1, and Cullin 4 A. Consequently, <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> V protein prevents responses to interleukin- 6 and v-Src signals and can induce apoptosis in STAT 3 -dependent multiple myeloma cells and transformed murine fibroblasts.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{estimate}} the importance of vaccine failure (VF) in cases of <b>mumps</b> during 2002 – 2004 in the city of Novosibirsk, Western Siberia, Russia, and to genotype the responsible virus strain. Mumps virus-specific RT-PCR testing of saliva was performed for 18 cases of <b>mumps.</b> Sera were tested for IgM and IgG, IgG avidity, and the ability to neutralise a panel of <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses,</b> including the Leningrad- 3 <b>mumps</b> vaccine <b>virus.</b> Of the 12 patients for whom vaccination status was positively determined, 11 showed serological evidence of primary VF. Sequence analysis of virus RNA amplified from saliva revealed a genotype C 2 virus in 2002, a genotype H 2 virus in 2003, and both genotypes in 2004. Although several vaccinated patients were positive for <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> IgG at the time of first sampling, only nominal levels of neutralising antibody were detected, and these were effective in neutralising the vaccine strain, but not genotype C and H <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> strains. These results suggest that the majority of cases of <b>mumps</b> in vaccinees are caused by primary VF, defined as either a lack of seroconversion or a lack of IgG maturity, as based on avidity testing. The results also support the hypothesis that sera of low neutralising antibody titre have a limited ability to neutralise heterologous <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> strains, suggesting that antigenic differences between circulating and <b>mumps</b> vaccine <b>virus</b> strains {{may play a role in}} cases of breakthrough infection.

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{reports from}} the {{countries}} where <b>mumps</b> vaccine is given as routine immunization suggest differences in <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> neutralizing antibody titres when tested with vaccine and wild type viruses. Such reports are unavailable from countries like India where <b>mumps</b> vaccine {{is not included in}} routine immunization. We, therefore, undertook this study to understand the cross-neutralization activity of Indian <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses.</b> Methods: By using commercial <b>mumps</b> IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a rapid focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), a panel of serum samples was tested. The panel consisted of 14 acute and 14 convalescent serum samples collected during a <b>mumps</b> outbreak and 18 archived serum samples. Two wild types (genotypes C and G) and Leningrad-Zagreb vaccine strain (genotype N) were used for the challenge experiments and FRNT titres were determined and further compared. The HN protein sequence of three <b>mumps</b> <b>viruses</b> was analyzed for the presence of key epitopes. Results: All serum samples effectively neutralized <b>mumps</b> <b>virus</b> wild types and a vaccine strain. However, significantly lower FRNT titres were noted to wild types than to vaccine strain (P< 0. 05). The comparison between EIA and FRNT results revealed 95. 6 per cent agreement. No amino acid changes were seen in the epitopes in the Indian wild type strains. All potential N-linked glycosylation sites were observed in Indian strains.
