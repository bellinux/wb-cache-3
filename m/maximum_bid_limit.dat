40|$|Examination of {{new data}} of the Mexican {{government}} securities primary auctions shows, not only that there exists underpricing {{with respect to the}} secondary market in CETES of 28, 91, 182, and 365 days maturity, but also that such underpricing tends to increase over time, especially during the period of 1996 - 2000. This study also finds that changes to the auction format employed by the Mexican Treasury do not fully account for this pattern because in spite that since 1995 the discriminatory format is in place, some modifications have been adopted with the purpose of improving sales conditions in the primary auctions, like setting common <b>maximum</b> <b>bidding</b> <b>limits</b> for all participants or reopening securities issues with high observed interest rates. Usual factors assumed to affect auction prices by existing models, like competition level, bidder participation and market uncertainty seem to play a role. However, evidence is also found that some factors related to secondary market features suggested by the finance microstructure literature, like liquidity, inventory and adverse selection costs may be playing an even more important role. Overall, these findings provide confirmation of the relevance of resale markets and suggests that: 1) it may be fruitful to add some of these latter features in future theoretical models about government securities markets and 2) to improve secondary market conditions may be important to enhance efficiency in the primary market...|$|R
5000|$|In proxy bidding, {{the wise}} bidder must {{know in advance}} the [...] "true" [...] value of an item {{as a basis for}} their secret <b>bidding</b> <b>limit.</b> The fact that the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> is {{revealed}} when it is outbid introduces the possibility of <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> fishing. Bidders unsure of the value of an item may incrementally increase their bid until they narrowly exceed the previously hidden maximum, thus placing themselves in a winning position without placing a very high bid.|$|R
50|$|By {{entering}} a <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> a user is indicating the highest {{he is willing}} to pay for a lot. An automated bidding service will bid on his behalf to ensure that he meets the reserve price, or that he always stays in the lead, up to his <b>maximum</b> <b>bid.</b> If someone else has placed a bid that is higher than the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> the bidder will be notified, allowing he to change the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> and stay in the auction. At the end of the auction, whoever's <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> is the most wins the lot.|$|R

25|$|Senior auction is a {{variation}} on the all-pay auction, and has a defined loser in addition to the winner. The top two bidders must pay their full final bid amounts, and only the highest wins the auction. The intent is to make the high bidders bid above their upper limits. In the final rounds of bidding, when the current losing party has hit their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> they are encouraged to <b>bid</b> over their <b>maximum</b> (seen as a small loss) to avoid losing their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> with no return (a very large loss).|$|R

50|$|Many online auctions use proxy bidding, an {{iterative}} sealed bid auction where winners pay a fixed increment {{over the}} second highest bid. The auctioneer does not disclose the current <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> but {{the second highest}} bid is always public.|$|R
5000|$|In a highest unique bid auction, the bid that is {{the highest}} and {{unmatched}} when the auction closes is the winning <b>bid.</b> A <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> value is usually set {{at a much lower}} level than the actual value of the lot.|$|R

40|$|The NCC decided, {{four days}} before the auction, that to allay fears about the coin toss it would change the rules of the auction. To {{eliminate}} the coin toss, the NCC set up a rule where there was no longer a <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> on the sealed bid phase of the auction. In the unlikely event that there was a tie between bidders, then these bidders would have to rebid with their tied bid being the new minimum bid. However, by setting up this new rule, the NCC had to relax one of its stated goals of the auction. When the NCC took out the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> requirement, it was now possible that the bidders in the sealed bid phase could bid mor...|$|R
5000|$|The {{failure of}} a <b>maximum</b> {{acceptable}} <b>bid</b> beaten by a sniper prepared to pay more is not due to the act of sniping, unless the original bidder would have bid higher on seeing their bid exceeded. For this reason, opposition to sniping can be analyzed {{as more of a}} subjective reaction to losing an auction for the usual reason of not bidding enough, than a reaction to a [...] "dirty trick". The beaten bidder would have beaten the sniper if their <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> had been more than the sniper was willing to offer.|$|R
40|$|Please do not quote without {{permission}} This paper proposes a simple statistical {{explanation for the}} phenomenon of extreme bids observed during house market booms. During a boom period the house market regime switches from a single bidder to a multiple bidder environment. The sale price in a multiple bidder auction is the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid,</b> {{and the distribution of}} <b>maximum</b> <b>bids</b> contains a much higher proportion of extreme bids compared with the distribution of single bidder valuations. The inevitability and simplicity of this statistical explanation of extreme bids in a rising house market justifies its claim to be the default explanation under the principle of Occam's razor. This statistical explanation of extreme bids during a house market boom is consistent with the observed phenomenon of estate agents lowering their offers over price during a boom...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{statistical}} {{explanation for the}} phenomenon of extreme bids. During a boom, the housing market regime switches from a single bidder to a multiple bidder environment. The sale price in a multiple bidder auction is the <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> {{and the distribution of}} <b>maximum</b> <b>bids</b> contains a much higher proportion of extreme bids compared with the distribution of single bidder valuations. While this theory does not preclude behavioural explanations of extreme bids, it does demonstrate that a world free from strategic and idiosyncratic behaviour would not be a world free from extreme bids during boom periods. Therefore, when gauging the impact of strategic or idiosyncratic behaviour (either hypothetically or empirically) one has to measure the effect against a baseline regime where extreme bids are inevitable, not against a world that is free from extreme bids...|$|R

50|$|Timed bidding auctions allow {{users to}} bid {{at any time}} during a defined time period, simply by {{entering}} a <b>maximum</b> <b>bid.</b> Timed auctions take place without an auctioneer calling the sale, so bidders don't have to wait for a lot to be called. This means that a bidder doesn't have to keep his eye on a live auction at a specific time.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIA new {{approach}} for {{the estimation of}} bid-rent functions for residential location choice is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} bid-auction approach and considers that the expected <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> of the auction is a latent variable that can be related to observed price indicators through a measurement equation. The method has the advantage of allowing for the estimation of the parameters of the bid function that explain the heterogeneous preferences of households for location while simultaneously adjusting the expected <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> to reproduce realistic values. The model is applied and validated for a case study on the city of Brussels. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other methods for bid-rent estimation, both in terms of real estate prices and spatial distribution of agents, especially when detailed data describing the real estate goods and their prices is not available.

50|$|Companies and {{charities}} can {{not only}} raise money through online auctions, but create awareness for a specific cause or charity. Online auction bidders can view photos, descriptions and suggested bids of items online, as opposed to items in a showroom.

50|$|However, if {{the minimum}} bid {{increment}} is very low, the sorites paradox can come into play, {{and make it}} difficult for a person to establish a single <b>maximum</b> <b>bid.</b> For example, if the minimum bid increment on an auction is 10 cents, it can be difficult or impossible for a person to identify a price which {{they would be willing to}} pay to win the item, but they would not pay 10 cents more.|$|R

50|$|Failure {{to reveal}} {{information}} {{leads to the}} winning bidder incurring the discovery costs himself and lowering his <b>maximum</b> <b>bid</b> due to the expenses incurred in acquiring information. If he {{is not able to}} get an independent assessment, then his bids will take into account the possibility of downside risk. Both scenarios can be shown to lower the expected revenue of the seller. The expected sale price is raised by lowering these discovery costs of the winning bidder, and instead providing information to all bidders for free.|$|R
