5|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills have contradictory {{results from}} different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate {{in women with}} multiple sclerosis. Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as carbamazepine (used to treat spasms and pain) and <b>modafinil</b> (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and <b>modafinil</b> for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or <b>modafinil,</b> as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
25|$|The main {{treatment}} of {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} in narcolepsy is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, <b>modafinil,</b> and armodafinil. In late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to <b>modafinil</b> was issued by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Modafinil</b> (Provigil) is a {{stimulant}} {{approved in}} the US {{for treatment of}} shift-work sleep disorder, which shares some characteristics with DSPD. A number of clinicians prescribe it for DSPD patients, as it may improve a sleep-deprived patient's ability to function adequately during socially desirable hours. It is generally not recommended to take <b>modafinil</b> after noon; <b>modafinil</b> is a relatively long-acting drug with a half-life of 15 hours, and taking it during the later {{part of the day}} can make it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.|$|E
25|$|A wakefulness-promoting {{agent that}} {{operates}} {{primarily as a}} selective, relatively weak, and atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Double-blind randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of <b>modafinil</b> in pediatric ADHD, however there are risks of serious side effects such as skin reactions and <b>modafinil</b> is not recommended for use in children. In the United States, it was originally pending marketing on-label as Sparlon, but approval was denied by the FDA due to major concerns over the occurrence of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants, which inhibit sleep, include caffeine, an {{adenosine}} antagonist; amphetamine, MDMA, empathogen-entactogens, {{and related}} drugs; cocaine, which {{can alter the}} circadian rhythm, and methylphenidate, which acts similarly; and other analeptic drugs like <b>Modafinil</b> and Armodafinil with poorly understood mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no cure, a number of {{lifestyle}} changes and medications may help. Lifestyle changes include taking regular short naps and sleep hygiene. Medications used include <b>modafinil,</b> sodium oxybate, and methylphenidate. While initially effective, tolerance to the benefits may develop over time. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve cataplexy.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} strategy involves {{adding another}} antidepressant, usually {{from a different}} class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this {{may be used in}} clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy. Other tests recently conducted include the use of psychostimulants as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining <b>modafinil</b> to treatment-resistant patients. It has been used to help combat SSRI-associated fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates other {{drugs such as}} amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} range of different symptoms. Different compounds are used to improve some of these problems. Examples are the use of clozapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and <b>modafinil</b> for day somnolence.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and methadone as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and <b>modafinil.</b> Methadone and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In several cases, stimulants, {{including}} <b>modafinil,</b> {{have been}} reported to have a limited effect on patients, often alleviating sleepiness. They can cause behavioral problems, but they may pose fewer issues if used in older patients with mild symptoms. In some case reports, lithium has been reported to decrease the length of episodes and the severity of their symptoms and to increase the time between episodes. It has been reported to be effective in about 25 to 60 percent of cases. Its use carries the risk of side effects in the thyroid or kidneys. Anti-psychotics and benzodiazepines can help alleviate psychotic and anxiety related symptoms, respectively. Carbamazepine has been reported to be less effective than lithium but more effective than some drugs in its class. Electroconvulsive therapy is not effective and worsens symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Conte {{claimed that}} rival coach Trevor Graham had {{revealed}} {{the drug to}} US testers, acting [...] "purely out of competitive jealousy" [...] as Chambers was challenging Graham's trainees; Montgomery and Greene. Chambers denied that he had any knowledge that the substance he was taking was banned and claimed he was deceived by Conte over its true use. However, he contradicted his statement in a later interview, {{saying that he had}} major suspicions that he was using banned substances but was too naïve and lacking in self-respect to act otherwise. By Chambers' own admission in 2008, in a letter by his supplier Conte to British anti-doping chief John Scott, THG was not the only substance he had used during his career. In his confession he admitted to the use of epitestosterone cream, EPO, HGH, insulin lispro, <b>modafinil</b> and liothyronine.|$|E

2500|$|Use of psychoactive drugs (such as stimulants), {{including}} certain medications, herbs, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, aripiprazole, MDMA, <b>modafinil,</b> or excessive alcohol intake.|$|E
2500|$|Doping was {{widespread}} at the 2003 USA Championships. A {{year after the}} competition, hurdler Brenda Taylor revealed she was offered banned substance <b>modafinil</b> and claimed that {{she thought she was}} [...] "the only person that didn't take it". This followed the revelation that several athletes had tested positive for that drug at the championships and received bans from the sport, including Kelli White, Chryste Gaines, Sandra Glover and Eric Thomas and John McEwen. The governing body USA Track & Field was criticised for not acting more quickly in reporting the failed tests. Despite the failed drug test, the American body failed to report this to the International Association of Athletics Federations until after she had won gold medals in both the 100m and 200m at the World Championships.|$|E
2500|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for directly treating schizoid personality disorder, but certain medications {{may reduce the}} symptoms of SPD as well as treat co-occurring mental disorders. The symptoms of SPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia, blunted affect and low energy, and SPD {{is thought to be}} part of the [...] "schizophrenic spectrum" [...] of disorders, which also includes the schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders, and may benefit from the medications indicated for schizophrenia. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a recent review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. In contrast, the substituted amphetamine Bupropion may be used to treat anhedonia. Likewise, <b>Modafinil</b> may be effective in treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are reflected in the symptomatology of SPD and therefore may help as well. Lamotrigine, SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and Hydroxyzine may help counter social anxiety in people with SPD if present, though social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. However, it is not general practice to treat SPD with medications, other than for the short term treatment of acute co-occurring Axis I conditions (e.g. depression).|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and <b>modafinil,</b> may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> acid (code name CRL-40467), {{also known}} as modafinilic acid or <b>modafinil</b> carboxylate, is the major {{metabolite}} of <b>modafinil,</b> {{and one of the}} two major metabolites of <b>modafinil</b> - the other being <b>modafinil</b> sulfone. <b>Modafinil</b> acid is also a metabolite of the <b>modafinil</b> prodrug, adrafinil, and the (R)-(-)-enantiomer is a metabolite of armodafinil, the (R)-(-)-enantiomer of <b>modafinil.</b> <b>Modafinil</b> acid seems to be inactive, and similarly to <b>modafinil</b> sulfone, does not appear to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting/psychostimulant effects of <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> sulfone (code name CRL-41056) is an achiral, {{oxidized}} metabolite of <b>modafinil,</b> a wakefulness-promoting agent. It {{is one of}} {{two major}} circulating metabolites of <b>modafinil,</b> the other being <b>modafinil</b> acid. <b>Modafinil</b> sulfone is also a metabolite of the <b>modafinil</b> prodrug, adrafinil. <b>Modafinil</b> sulfone is also a metabolite of armodafinil, the (R)-(-)-enantiomer of <b>modafinil,</b> as oxidation to the sulfone removes the chiral center at the sulfur atom. <b>Modafinil</b> sulfone has been described as inactive, and similarly to <b>modafinil</b> acid, does not appear to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting/psychostimulant effects of <b>modafinil.</b> However, like <b>modafinil,</b> <b>modafinil</b> sulfone was found to show anticonvulsant properties in animals, indicating that it does possess some biological activity.|$|E
50|$|In the {{breakdown}} process of <b>modafinil,</b> <b>modafinil</b> is primarily hydrolyzed by an esterase or amidase enzyme into <b>modafinil</b> acid. The apparent clearance of <b>modafinil</b> acid is {{significantly higher than}} that of <b>modafinil,</b> following the hypothesis that metabolism increases the polarity and the clearance of <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>modafinil,</b> adrafinil also produces <b>modafinil</b> acid (CRL-40467) and <b>modafinil</b> sulfone (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{two major}} {{circulating}} metabolites of <b>modafinil</b> are <b>modafinil</b> acid (CRL-40467) and <b>modafinil</b> sulfone (CRL-41056). Both of these metabolites {{have been described}} as inactive, and neither appear to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting effects of <b>modafinil.</b> However, <b>modafinil</b> sulfone does appear to possess anticonvulsant effects, and this is a property that it shares with <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> may possess yet an {{additional}} mechanism of action. Both <b>modafinil</b> and its metabolite, <b>modafinil</b> sulfone, possess anticonvulsant properties in animals, and <b>modafinil</b> sulfone {{is nearly as}} potent as <b>modafinil</b> in producing this effect. However, <b>modafinil</b> sulfone lacks any wakefulness-promoting effects in animals, indicating that a distinct mechanism may be at play in the anticonvulsant effects of both compounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> and R-modafinil {{are useful}} to improve {{alertness}} and reduce sleepiness in shift workers. <b>Modafinil</b> {{has a low}} risk of abuse compared to other similar agents. However, 10% more participants reported side effects, nausea and headache, while taking <b>Modafinil.</b> In post-marketing surveillance <b>Modafinil</b> {{was associated with the}} severe Steven Johnson syndrome. The European Medicines Agency withdrew the license for <b>Modafinil</b> for shift workers for the European market because it judged that the benefits did not outweigh the side effects.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{two years}} after the {{discovery}} of adrafinil, <b>modafinil,</b> its active metabolite, was discovered. <b>Modafinil</b> appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and <b>modafinil</b> eventually reaching the market. <b>Modafinil</b> was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998. Lafon was acquired by Cephalon in 2001. As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its adrafinil product, while <b>modafinil</b> continues to be marketed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly popular among the general population. Apart from a consumer's want to increase his neurological performance, there are financial incentives for manufacturers as well. <b>Modafinil</b> has a market share of more than $700 million a year, indicating {{a high degree of}} off-label use. <b>Modafinil</b> {{is also one of the}} more easily available neuroenhancement drugs in the market today. <b>Modafinil</b> can be boughtfrom many websites - mostly from Asian countries - as well as from darknet markets. <b>Modafinil</b> first came into attention when world champion runner Kelli White was tested positive for illegally consuming <b>modafinil</b> in the Athletics World Championship in 2003, resulting in the loss of her two gold medals.|$|E
50|$|The prototypical eugeroic is modafinil; {{other drugs}} in the class include {{adrafinil}} and armodafinil. <b>Modafinil</b> and armodafinil {{have been found to}} act as selective, weak, atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Adrafinil is a prodrug of <b>modafinil</b> and therefore has the same mechanism of action as <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Japan, <b>modafinil</b> is Schedule I psychotropic drug. There {{have been}} {{reported}} arrests of people who imported <b>modafinil</b> for personal use.|$|E
50|$|Militaries {{of several}} {{countries}} {{are known to}} have expressed interest in <b>modafinil</b> as an alternative to amphetamine—the drug traditionally employed in combat situations where troops face sleep deprivation, such as during lengthy missions. The French government indicated that the Foreign Legion used <b>modafinil</b> during certain covert operations. The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence commissioned research into <b>modafinil</b> from QinetiQ and spent £300,000 on one investigation. In 2011, the Indian Air Force announced that <b>modafinil</b> was included in contingency plans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modafinil</b> {{has also}} found off-label {{use with the}} {{neurological}} fatigue reported by some with multiple sclerosis. In 2000, Cephalon conducted a study to evaluate <b>modafinil</b> as a potential treatment for MS-related fatigue. A group of 72 people with MS of varying degrees of severity tested two different doses of <b>modafinil</b> and an inactive placebo over nine weeks. Fatigue levels were self-evaluated on standardized scales. Participants taking a lower dose of <b>modafinil</b> reported feeling less fatigued {{and there was a}} statistically significant difference in fatigue scores for the lower dose versus the placebo. The higher dose of <b>modafinil</b> was not reported to be significantly more effective.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{to whether}} the cognitive effects <b>modafinil</b> showed in healthy non-sleep-deprived people are sufficient to consider {{it to be a}} cognitive enhancer. The researchers agree that <b>modafinil</b> improves some aspects of working memory, such as digit span, digit manipulation and pattern recognition memory, but the results related to spatial memory, executive function and attention are equivocal. Some positive effects of <b>modafinil</b> may be limited to [...] "lower-performing" [...] individuals. One study found that <b>modafinil</b> restored normal levels of learning ability in methamphetamine addicts, but had no effect on non-addicts. <b>Modafinil</b> reduces the symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and improves working and episodic memory.|$|E
50|$|In Russia <b>modafinil</b> is Schedule II {{controlled}} substance like cocaine and morphine. Possession of few <b>modafinil</b> pills {{can lead to}} 3-10 years imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|Specific {{treatment}} for fatigue, {{which may be}} debilitating in some patients, is limited and undergoing trials. Some studies indicate that Provigil (<b>modafinil)</b> may be effective without damaging the liver. Though <b>modafinil</b> is no longer covered by patents, the limiting factor in its use in the U.S. is cost. The manufacturer, Cephalon, has made agreements with manufacturers of generic <b>modafinil</b> to provide payments in exchange for delaying their sale of <b>modafinil.</b> [...] The FTC has filed suit against Cephalon alleging anti-competitive behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{addiction}} and dependence liabilities of <b>modafinil</b> are very low. It shares biochemical mechanisms with addictive stimulant drugs, and {{some studies have}} reported it to have similar mood-elevating properties, although to a lesser degree. Monkeys will self-administer <b>modafinil</b> if they have previously been trained to self-administer cocaine. Although <b>modafinil</b> does not produce reinforcing effects in mice at doses that are equivalent to those used therapeutically in humans, it does do so at higher doses. In accordance, although very rare, case reports of <b>modafinil</b> abuse exist. As such, <b>modafinil</b> is classified by the United States FDA as a schedule IV controlled substance, a category for drugs with valid medical uses and low but significant addiction potential.|$|E
50|$|A study {{published}} by chemists {{working for the}} biopharmaceutical company Cephalon to develop a successor to the wakefulness-promoting agent (or eugeroic) <b>modafinil</b> reported that the corresponding fluorenol derivative was 39% more effective than <b>modafinil</b> at keeping mice awake over a 4-hour period. It is a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor with an IC50 of 9 μM, notably 59% weaker than <b>modafinil</b> (IC50 = 3.70 μM) despite being a stronger wakefulness-promoting agent, potentially making it even less liable for addiction. It also showed no affinity for cytochrome P450 2C19, unlike <b>modafinil.</b>|$|E
