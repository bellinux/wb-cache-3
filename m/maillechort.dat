50|$|Son of {{a violin}} maker, Clasquin {{was born in}} 1875 and served his {{apprenticeship}} under Charles Nicolas Bazin. He joined the Jérôme Thibouville-Lamy firm before establishing his own workshop in Paris in 1918. He also worked for some other violinmakers and devoted part of his time to repair work. Clasquin's production consists mainly of violin and cello bows mounted in silver as well as <b>maillechort</b> (French nickel silver). His production was not abundant, but always of good quality. His style is reminiscent to that of Émile François Ouchard. He died in Paris in 1929.|$|E
5000|$|The Silva-Bet, {{body and}} keys, {{is made of}} an alloy {{variously}} known as <b>maillechort,</b> German silver or nickel silver, and is plated with silver. The toneholes, except on the earliest examples, have widened tops to improve the sealing and durability of the pads. First made with a one-piece body with detachable barrel, the Silva-Bet clarinet was later available with a two-piece body plus detachable barrel. The barrel of the Silva-Bet features a telescoping mechanism for tuning the instrument. There {{are at least two}} varieties of tuning barrel, one with a thick head and two slim rotating rings at the top, the other with a thin head with a single rotating sleeve in the middle. [...] There are also at least two varieties of thumb rest, one with the platform and rest a single curved plate attached to the body by a rail, the other with the platform a box attached to the body all around and the rest soldered to that box.|$|E
50|$|In metallurgy, melchior is an alloy of copper, {{mainly with}} nickel (5-30%). Its name {{originates}} from melchior, {{which in turn}} is distorted <b>maillechort,</b> honoring the French inventors of the alloy, Maillot and Chorier. The term melchior sometimes refers not only to the copper-nickel alloys, but also ternary alloys of copper with nickel and zinc ("nickel silver") and even a silvered brass. Melchior is easily deformable by application of pressure, both in the hot and cold state. After annealing, it has a tensile strength of about 40 kg/mm2. The most valuable property of melchior is its high resistance to corrosion in air, freshwater and seawater. Increasing content of nickel iron or manganese improves corrosion and cavitation resistance, especially in sea water and atmospheric water vapor. The alloy of 30% Ni, 0.8% Fe, 1% Mn and 68.2% copper is used in maritime shipping, in particular for the manufacture of condenser tubes. Thanks to the nickel, melchior, unlike brass and bronze, has not a yellow but a silver color. Together with high corrosion resistance, this silvery color is preferred for the manufacture of household utensils.|$|E
