5|$|The Flavian period {{also saw}} the first {{formation}} of large, double-size units, both infantry and cavalry, of a nominal strength of 1,000 men (cohors/ala milliaria), though they were actually mostly smaller (720 for an ala milliaria and 800 for a cohors milliaria). These were the <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double-strength first cohorts of legions also introduced at this time. Such units remained {{a minority of the}} Auxilia: in the mid-2nd century, they constituted 13% of units, containing 20% of total manpower.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5000|$|Some 7" [...] {{releases}} {{printed and}} manufactured in Germany have side A as <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original side B cover whereas side B is <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original side A cover.

5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German {{submarines}} which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy aircraft flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt submarines, {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in an ironic twist, the U.S. submarines fought against Japanese shipping in a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, with U.S. submarines hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the}} war the U.S. had 260 submarines in commission. It had lost 52 submarines during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. Submarines effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and choked off Japan's oil supply.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

25|$|Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{orthodox}} stance, {{which can}} create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses {{from the opposite}} side.

30|$|Finally, an {{available}} texture in {{the input}} 2 D image is mapped onto the dense 3 D facial shape {{to complete the}} 3 D face reconstruction. However, some facial texture regions can be self-occluded in rotated view images. Thus, <b>the</b> bilateral symmetry <b>of</b> a face is used for texture mapping to recover the self-occluded texture. Specifically, we produce a <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half-face contained in the visible region, and use <b>the</b> mirrored texture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visible half-face for texture mapping in the occluded facial region.|$|R
