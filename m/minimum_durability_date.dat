40|$|With {{respect to}} the Food Labelling Ordinance of the FRG, a report is given from {{practice}} on the minimum durability. The span between purchase and "best before" date of pre-packs was investigated sensorically {{in order to get}} a not yet representative insight into the quality level, during their remaining life, of a number of new foods brought from the trade and found increasingly on the market. Nutritive value, enjoyment value and usefulness determine their properties. The enjoyment value, i. e. shape, colour, smell, taste and consistency, is of particular interest to the customer. Even with a relatively low designated traffic limit, which allows noticeable impairments of the sensory properties and slight faults, only a few of the product batches investigated reached the "best before" (<b>minimum</b> <b>durability)</b> <b>date</b> without clear losses of their enjoyment value. The majority of the foods investigated had an overstreched "best before" dating.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the quality of multifloral honeys in {{relation}} to origin (domestic vs. foreign), and storage time (before vs. after the <b>date</b> of <b>minimum</b> <b>durability)</b> available on the Polish retail market. The study was conducted on 24 samples of multifloral honey, including domestic ones (i. e. originated directly from beekeepers in open-air markets, or purchased in a retail chain), and foreign (i. e. from inside or outside the EU) bought in hypermarkets. In addition, the study comprised 5 samples of honey after the <b>date</b> of <b>minimum</b> <b>durability.</b> The content of hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF), diastase number (DN) and colour according to CIE L*a*b* were determined in honeys. In the fresh multifloral honeys (irrespective of origin) the content of 5 -HMF ranged from 1. 17 to 18. 54 mg*kg- 1, and DN ranged from 8. 36 to 34. 88. Thus all samples met the legal requirements (5 -HMF< 40 mg*kg- 1 and DN< 8 on the Schade scale). Significant (P= 0. 01) deterioration in the quality of the honey was noted after the <b>date</b> of <b>minimum</b> <b>durability.</b> The mean HMF content (93. 87 mg*kg- 1) was twice as high as the acceptable value, and the mean DN (6. 45) was lower than the accepted limit.

There were a few problems, but considering, the many electrical and mechanical devices used in the automatic system it has always functioned quite well. Rapid freezing and thawing of 4 "x 4 "xl 8 " concrete beams has been conducted primarily in accordance with ASTM C- 29 l (now ASTM C- 666 procedure B) at the rate of one beam per day. Over 4000 beams have been tested since 1961, with determination of the resulting durability factors. Various methods of curing were used and a standard 90 day moist cure was selected. This cure seemed to yield durability factors that correlated very well with ratings of coarse aggregates based on service records. Some concrete beams had been made using the same coarse aggregate and the durability factors compared relatively well with previous tests. Durability factors seemed to yield reasonable results until large variations in durability factors were noted from beams of identical concrete mix proportions in research projects R- 234 and R- 247. This then presents the question "How reliable is the durability as determined by ASTM C- 666 ?" This question became increasingly more important when a specification requiring a <b>minimum</b> <b>durability</b> factor for P.

40|$|In June 2010 {{consumer}} complaints in Italy were reported concerning mozzarella cheese which was discoloured after opening. According to Italian authorities, the discolouration {{was caused by}} the bacteria Pseudomonas (P.) tolaasii and P. libanensis, of which high microbial counts were detected in the cheese. The Italian Ministry of Health assumes that the bacteria result from contaminated water which was used as brine for the cheese. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has provisionally assessed the potentially related health effects on humans. According to present knowledge, these pose no human health hazard, they can, however, spoil the food and render it unfit for consumption. Pseudomonads are bacteria that can be present nearly everywhere in the environment. These spoilage bacteria that can multiply even at low temperatures have long been documented. The Committee for Biological Agents (ABAS) has classified the bacteria in question Pseudomonas (P.) tolaasii and P. libanensis in the lowest risk level, as they are not expected to constitute a health risk for humans. BfR is neither aware of information concerning food-borne diseases caused by these bacteria nor are studies available concerning the transmission of microorganisms to humans. Research studies on the presence of pseudomonads in mozzarella with such discolouration have been carried out chiefly by Italian scientists. From a hygienic perspective, mozzarella cheese is a sensitive food. BfR recommends that the cheese is stored in the refrigerator at less than + 7 degrees Celsius. Manufacturers should determine the best before date with great care {{in order to maintain the}} quality of the cheese until <b>date</b> of <b>minimum</b> <b>durability</b> is reached.

Investigation revealed that Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members inside low humidity buildings (class XC 1) and is not suitable for the construction of buried building foundations and external building superstructure members. Portlandlimestone cement grade 42. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members in exposure classes XC 1 and XC 2 (building superstructure members subject to long-term water contact) and building foundations buried in non-aggressive natural soils and groundwater.

Thus, durability {{plays a key role}} to enhance circular economy and resource conservation, for example in the category of electrical and electronic equipment. However, it was observed that the average lifetime of these products has decreased over recent years. We identified the washing machine product group as a relevant case study {{for the development of a}} durability test, and as a potential trigger to systematically address durability in the design of products. The main objective of this research was to develop a procedure to test <b>minimum</b> <b>durability</b> performance of washing machines, on which limitations and potentials for future improvements would be highlighted. The procedure was developed to potentially be used in policy. The durability test was developed considering the whole product tested under overstressed conditions. A series of spinning cycles with fixed unbalanced loads was run on two washing machines, to observe failures and performance changes during the test. Even though no hard failures occurred, results clearly showed that not all of the washing machines are able to sustain such a test without abrasion, or performance deterioration. The proposed test allowed to have results in a relatively short amount of efforts and time, which makes it compatible with policy constraints. However, the attempt to mimic the stress induced on a washing machine by doing a high number of pure spinning cycles with fixed loads did not allow equal testing conditions: The actions of the control procedure regarding unbalance loads differ from machine to machine. Therefore, future developments will need to replace the series of spinning cycles with various washing programmes, and the fixed unbalanced loads with real loads, paying attention to limit the time required by the test. The outcomes of this research can be used as a basis to develop standardized durability tests and to hence contribute to the development of future product’s policy measures. JRC.

To select qualitative estimation indicators of chlorhexidine digluconate solutions and define quality specifications. 3. To carry out the quality evalution of chlorhexidine digluconate products, to test the influence of different factors (temperature, pH, light) on quality of chlorhexidine digluconate. 4. To carry out stability test of chlorhexidine digluconate solutions and recommend the <b>date</b> of <b>minimum</b> <b>durability</b> for these products. In this MA thesisa sterile chlorehexidine digluconate 0, 02 % and 0, 05 % solution, produced at the pharmacy of LSMU Kaunas clinics, was tested. Long-term and accelerated stability tests were carried out, but also solution under the influence of stress factors was examined. The amount of chlorhexidine was determined using the UV spectrophotometry method, on the other hand, the components in the mixture were identified using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The qualitative indexes of the chlorhexidine digluconate solutions were determined: appearance: colorless, odorless liquid, the value of the pH in interval 5, 5 – 7, 0, chlorhexidine digluconate amount in the solutions and the sterility tests was also performed. While performing long-term stability tests it was determined that after 3 months chlorhexidine digluconate solutions remain stable and sterile. After performing primary measurements, after 6 months, the lowered cholerhexidine amount was determined in the 1 series of the preparations, which was only 15. 92 after the initial quantity. In other series, there was no such change, so it was decided to perform the repeated test and to evaluate the result validity of the tests. The indexes of the solutions remain unchanged for the five months, while keeping it in 40 °C temperature and in 75 % of humidity. When chlorhexidine digluconate solutions were evaluated after the effect in the stressed factors, it was determined, that the molecule is resistance for the alcaline medium, 70 °C temperature and the day light. The chlorhexidine molecule split in 24 hours in the acidic environment, when pH was 2. 7 (p< 0, 05).

A {{two year}} study of {{evaluate}} the valid service life of durable pavement markings on urban roads {{was conducted in}} Beijing as a pilot field study of Chinese national transportation product evaluation program and minimum retro-reflectivity requirements standards and road maintenance standards. 34 pavement marking lines including edge line, arrow, skip line, crossing line and stop line were installed on expressway and intersection. Marking materials included thermoplastic with glass beads, preformed thermoplastic tape with glass beads and preformed rubber based pavement tape. Service life evaluation was base on <b>minimum</b> value of <b>durability</b> and retro-reflectivity. Retro-reflectivity attenuation varies at different locations (express way, intersection), different marking functions (e. g., skip line, edge line) and different materials (thermoplastic or tape).

The most loss of retro-reflectivity happens at stop lines, skip line and cross line are better, arrows are less, edge line is the best. Cleanliness factor are also considered, retro-reflectivity significantly rises after cleaned. A maintenance schedule for different markings was given in this paper.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structures are}} susceptible {{to a variety of}} deterioration mechanisms due to creep and shrinkage, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), carbonation, and corrosion of the reinforcement. The deterioration problems can affect the integrity and load carrying capacity of the structure. Substantial research has been dedicated to these various mechanisms aiming to identify the causes, reactions, accelerants, retardants and consequences. This has improved our understanding of the long-term behaviour of reinforced concrete structures. However, the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures for <b>durability</b> has to <b>date</b> been mainly undertaken after expert assessment of field data followed by the development of a scheme to both terminate continuing degradation, by separating the structure from the environment, and strengthening the structure. The process does not include any significant consideration of the residual load-bearing capacity of the structure and the highly variable nature of estimates of such remaining capacity. Development of performance curves for deteriorating bridge structures has not been attempted due to the difficulty in developing a model when the input parameters have an extremely large variability. This paper presents a framework developed for an asset management system which assesses residual capacity and identifies the most appropriate rehabilitation method for a given reinforced concrete structure exposed to aggressive environments. In developing the framework, several industry consultation sessions have been conducted to identify input data required, research methodology and output knowledge base. Capturing expert opinion in a useable knowledge base requires development of a rule based formulation, which can subsequently be used to model the reliability of the performance curve of a reinforced concrete structure exposed to a given environment...|$|R

To predict the pressure production of this garment, the thermo-mechanics of a SMP was combined with the textile mechanics of a biaxial tubular braid and simulated within design parameter ranges consistent with the design criteria and practical considerations. The pressure production was controllable with the design parameters SMP elastic modulus, garment radial deformation, textile fiber spacing, and operational temperature. Assuming reasonable model accuracy, a SMP garment could achieve the necessary pressure production for a space qualified MCP suit, however, the durability of such a garment would be questionable considering the creep sustained from consecutive spacewalks of four to eight hours.

40|$|Stone {{materials}} outdoor exposed {{slowly but}} inevitably undergo a degradation process, either by natural or artificial causes. The {{rate of degradation}} has recently experienced an important acceleration due to natural and anthropic changes in the climatic conditions. It {{is well known that}} water plays {{a central role in the}} mechanisms of decay (through chemical and physical action), because it is involved in the transport of air pollutants, biodeteriogen growth, transport and crystallization of soluble salts inside the stone and freezing/thaw cycles. In the last decades synthetic polymers have been widely employed for treatment of stone materials as protective coatings, examples being polyacrylates, polysiloxanes and synthetic waxes. However these polymers were chosen among commercial products already available, that often did not meet the requirements for application on artifacts of historical and artistic interest (e. g. <b>minimum</b> alteration, <b>durability</b> and reversibility). Following the principles of green chemistry, in this work a new class of synthetic polymers derived from polylalctic acid has been developed and tested as protective materials for stone surfaces. By copolymerization of substituted glycolides and lactones, such as lactide, mandelide and salicylide, copolymers with tailor made properties were prepared. Most notably Tg, hydrophobicity and UV barrier properties were improved over conventional PLA. A high and controlled Tg, far from ambient temperature, is particularly important for a polymer coating, so it never stays in the sticky-rubbery state and is less affected by temperature variations during outdoor exposition. The introduction of perfluorinated chain segments, either by functionalization with perfluoro-alcohols or diols, allowed to improve the hydrorepellency and durability of the coatings. Fluorine containing polymers showed almost no signs of degradation in the accelerated ageing tests, showing excellent stability to photo-oxidative deterioration and negligible color changes. Another approach to these goals was the synthesis of polylactic acid/silica nanocomposite coatings for the protection of building stones. These organic-inorganic hybrid materials showed improved hydrophobic properties, with water contact angles as high as 137 ° on stone and glass surfaces, keeping the water barrier properties and durability of fluorinated polylactic acid. A very simple procedure was developed for the synthesis of these materials, by mixing the organic and inorganic components in an organic solution, stirring and directly applying the solution on the surface to be protected. Microscopic analysis (SEM, HAADF-STEM) showed an uniform coating constituted by single particles and larger aggregates covered by the polymer matrix. AFM showed a marked increase of surface roughness, increasing the three-phases contact area between water, air and solid substrate, effectively preventing the penetration of water in the pores of the matrix. Due to the high hysteresis (about 22 °) water droplets remained stuck on the surface instead of rolling off, an effect very similar to the natural one occurring on some plants (e. g. rose petals). A reversibility test was carried out by treatment of coated surfaces with organic solvent. The results (AFM, SEM, EDX) indicated that the coating was completely removed, even with the highest silica content, confirming the reversibility of the treatments...|$|R
