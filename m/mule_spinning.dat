5|$|In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the {{retained}} engine house, boiler house, chimney {{and steam}} engine of Ellenroad Mill, a former 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet. Now operated as an industrial heritage centre, the mill itself {{is no longer}} standing, but the steam engine (the world's largest working steam mill engine) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust. The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using <b>mule</b> <b>spinning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{well-established}} {{textile processing}} and trading infrastructure, and the ready {{supply of water}} from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted entrepreneurs who built cotton mills {{along the banks of the}} river in Pendleton and Ordsall. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour. Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. With the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century however, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip's and Lee's Twist Mill in Salford, completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain. The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. It was however outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough's steam-driven <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).|$|E

50|$|Samuel Crompton's <b>Spinning</b> <b>Mule,</b> {{introduced}} in 1779, {{was a combination}} of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating. Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost. <b>Mule</b> <b>spun</b> thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive cloth in large quantities.|$|R

50|$|A spindle is {{also part}} of {{traditional}} spinning wheels where it is horizontal, such as the Indian charkha and the great or walking wheel. In industrial yarn production, spindles are used as well; see <b>spinning</b> jenny, <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> and ring <b>spinning.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most {{spinning}} {{today is}} done using Break or Open-end spinning, {{this is a}} technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method has replaced the older methods of ring and <b>mule</b> <b>spinning.</b> It also is easily adapted for artificial fibres.|$|E

2500|$|In <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> the roving {{is pulled}} off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several {{different}} speeds.

The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. <b>Mule</b> <b>spinning</b> produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning.|$|E

25|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> <b>spins</b> {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an {{intermittent}} process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|R
