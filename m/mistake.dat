5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} <b>mistake</b> can have bigger consequences than an attacking <b>mistake.</b> Thus, the defender {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.|$|E
5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental <b>mistake</b> (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the <b>mistake</b> after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the <b>mistake</b> or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E

As such, ignorance of the <b>mistake</b> would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} typical <b>mistakes</b> in written speech made by first-year {{students}} {{learning a new}} register of their native language. Interpretation {{of the reasons for}} these ‘risk points’ in vocabulary and grammar characteristic of contemporary Russian speech is given. <b>Mistakes</b> in a written text can be different. Primary <b>mistakes</b> are caused by the lack of competence, while secondary <b>mistakes</b> result from author’s attempt to correct the text. The secondary <b>mistakes</b> often arise when the author thinks over different ways to express his/her idea. In this situation, <b>mistakes</b> are caused by the conflict of different formulations. The secondary <b>mistakes</b> are evidences of author’s high competence. Authors generally are able to correct these <b>mistakes</b> and find good variants to replace the wrong word or expression. One of the main tasks of the courses in Russian language is to encourage students to work with texts, look for the best formulations for their ideas. </p...|$|R

40|$|Consumers make <b>mistakes.</b> Imperfect {{information}} and imperfect rationality lead to misperception of {{benefits and costs}} associated with a product. As a result consumers might fail to maximize their preferences in product choice or product use. A proposed taxonomy of consumer <b>mistakes</b> draws attention to a less-studied category of mistakes: use-pattern mistakes—mistakes about how the consumer will use the product. Use-pattern <b>mistakes</b> are prevalent. Sellers respond strategically to use-pattern <b>mistakes</b> by redesigning their products, contracts and pricing schemes. These strategic, design responses often exacerbate the welfare-costs associated with consumer <b>mistakes.</b> From a policy perspective, focusing on disclosure regulation, the importance of use-pattern <b>mistakes</b> requires more, and better, use-pattern disclosure. In particular, sellers {{should be required to}} provide individualized use-pattern information...|$|R

40|$|In the essay, {{the view}} of <b>mistakes</b> and {{disciplinary}} sanctions within the military aviation and health and medical service, are compared. The comparison shows that military aviation and health and medical service could have several points in common on how <b>mistakes</b> may occur, but that the present view of <b>mistakes</b> is different betwen the sectors. The view of <b>mistakes</b> and disciplinary sanctions is explicit within military aviation, {{and is based on}} a clear ideology on how <b>mistakes</b> occur, which is characterised of a systematic approach. Within health and medical service, an explicit and unequivocal ideology on how <b>mistakes</b> occur is missing, but, however, there are implicit ideas about infallibility and perfection. The comparison indicates that {{the view of}} <b>mistakes</b> is also, possibly directed by a bureaucratic model (instead of an ideology on <b>mistakes),</b> which aims to legitimacy, but that this may happen on the expense of not taking surrounding circumstances into consideration. In that way there may be a certain contrast in the health and medical service’s present system between rule of law and medical service safety...|$|R
