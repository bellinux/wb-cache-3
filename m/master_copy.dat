When Gowariker learnt about the incident, he lodged a police {{complaint}} immediately. The case {{was taken over by}} the Mumbai Crime Branch. UTV Motion Pictures sent a legal notice to Adlabs Films and UFO Movies, the film's processing and digitising laboratories. It was later revealed that a top official of the lab had sold the <b>master</b> <b>copy</b> for 200,000 rupees to film pirates to make pirated copies {{of the film}} to sell in India and overseas. Several people were arrested, including the manager of Adlabs Processing, for allegedly stealing the <b>master</b> <b>copy</b> and producing pirated copies. The print was later recovered by the police, who also found and seized pirated CDs and DVDs produced from the <b>master</b> <b>copy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film's <b>master</b> <b>copy</b> {{was stolen}} from Adlabs before its release, {{and a few days}} later was {{recovered}} by the police, who found and seized several pirated copies of the film created from the <b>master</b> <b>copy.</b> The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on 25 September 2009. With a box office gross 160 million, it was unsuccessful and received mixed reviews, with criticism for its over three-and-a-half-hour run time and its screenplay. However, the film garnered acclaim for its soundtrack and Chopra's performance, which received a nomination for the Screen Award for Best Actress. She also became the first actress in history to portray twelve roles in one film, a feat considered for inclusion in the Guinness World Records.|$|E

25|$|The {{surviving}} {{texts of}} the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single <b>master</b> <b>copy</b> produced by Sasanian Empire-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That <b>master</b> <b>copy,</b> now lost, {{is known as the}} 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (K1) of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE. Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that {{a significant portion of the}} literature in the Avestan language has been lost. Only about one-quarter of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.|$|E

Moore states that his intentions were to travel to the US Naval base in Guantánamo Bay. Upon Moore's arrival at Guantánamo Bay, a siren was sounded and Moore decided to turn around for safety.|$|E
500|$|The second {{episode of}} the series {{was the first to}} feature {{predominantly}} original writing, as the [...] "Pilot" [...] contained many jokes from the British series pilot. During one of Michael's impersonations, a racial expletive spoken by Michael had to be censored by the producers for NBC. Daniels was terrified that the scene would leak unedited, so he personally oversaw the censoring of the <b>master</b> <b>copy.</b> The scene where Pam rests her head on Jim's shoulder after Dwight has stolen his sale and Jim smiles and says [...] "not a bad day after all" [...] came about when Greg Daniels spoke to the writers about wanting to have small, happy interactions between Jim and Pam and mentioned the head-on-shoulder idea, which B. J. Novak immediately wrote into his script. Paul Lieberstein did not want to appear in the episode and did so assuming it would be a one-time event, but Kevin Reilly was impressed by his work and said the show should use him more, leading to the expansion of Paul's work as Toby Flenderson. Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's [...] "HERO" [...] acronym by creating one that sounded good until everyone noticed the words created the acronym of [...] "INCEST", and Michael responded to Mr. Brown's nixing of that idea by pointing out the links between incest and racism in some states, while another had Jim replacing Dwight's [...] "Asian" [...] headband with [...] "Dwight" [...] and then having the other co-workers complain to a clueless Dwight about how annoying his behavior was.|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} {{environments that}} collect or monitor data, useful data may be spread across multiple distributed nodes, but users or applications {{may wish to}} access that data from a central location. A common way to facilitate centralized access to distributed data is to maintain replicas of data objects of interest at a central location. When data collections are large or volatile, keeping replicas consistent with remote <b>master</b> <b>copies</b> poses a significant challenge due to the large communication cost incurred. Consequently, in many real-world environments exact replica consistency is not maintained, and some form of inexact, or approximate, replication is typically used instead. Approximate replication is often performed by refreshing replicas periodically. Periodic refreshing allows communication cost to be controlled, {{but it does not}} always make good use of communication resources: In between refreshes some remote <b>master</b> <b>copies</b> may change significantly, leaving replicas excessively out of date and inaccurate, and meanwhile resources may be wasted refreshing replicas of other <b>master</b> <b>copies</b> that remain nearly unchanged.

2500|$|A {{recent study}} {{has argued that}} the Quran we have today is exactly the same as the one {{compiled}} by 'Ali ibn Abi-Talib, and that the reading of Hafs from his teacher 'Asim to be the unaltered reading of 'Ali. This is because 'Asim's teacher, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami, had learnt the Quran from 'Ali. Furthermore, Hafs was a Companion of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and it is claimed that the latter had inherited 'Ali's <b>Master</b> <b>Copy</b> of the Quran. The study provides a case that it was 'Ali's <b>Master</b> <b>Copy</b> which formed the basis of the 'Uthmanic canon. As for the reading of Hafs, the study presents evidence that the latter had learnt the Quran from two sources: 'Asim who was his main teacher, and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq who provided him with a corrective of 'Asim's reading. If future research can validate these preliminary findings, then this could very well mean that the reading of Hafs from Asim is the de facto reading of 'Ali which he inherited from the Prophet till the very last dot." ...|$|E
