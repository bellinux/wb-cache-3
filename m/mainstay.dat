5|$|The lumber {{industries}} and stone mines {{on both sides}} of the river were eventually exhausted and closed. Tourists coming up the river from Port Jervis became the <b>mainstay</b> of the local economy. During the next two decades, seasonal homes and hotels were built in Pond Eddy.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak retired its {{fleet of}} F40PHs {{in the mid-1990s}} {{in favor of the}} GE Genesis, but the {{locomotive}} remains the <b>mainstay</b> of Via Rail's long-distance trains and is a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States. In addition, Amtrak has kept a number of de-engined F40PHs in use as Cabbage cars/Non-Powered Control Units.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. During his tenure, the wing developed from a rather new unit to the <b>mainstay</b> of air {{defense in the}} Northeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor MBE (born 25 September 1975) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} England more than 150 times between 1998 and 2011. A top order batsman, Taylor {{was the first woman}} to be named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Along with Charlotte Edwards, she was the <b>mainstay</b> of England's batting during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, and played a key role in the team's two world titles in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the <b>mainstay</b> treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> of {{treatment}} is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mainstay</b> of {{treatment}} is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} {{is also a}} <b>mainstay</b> for communities on the lagoon. Beach-goers must pass the Laguna Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands. Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel, where the Texas International Fishing Tournament has been held since 1934. Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the <b>mainstay</b> of the {{industry}} for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a <b>mainstay</b> of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|Before filming, Mendes {{sought to}} produce a period film that would avoid clichés in the gangster genre. He chose to film Road to Perdition on {{location}} in downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman {{as well as the}} Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. The Armory, the state's largest location <b>mainstay</b> which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the Armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings.|$|E

5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a <b>mainstay</b> for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} of great {{creativity}} for the British musical scene {{in the summer of}} 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as <b>mainstay</b> and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the <b>mainstay</b> of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
