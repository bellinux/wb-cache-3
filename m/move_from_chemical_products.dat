Heavy metals and metalloids pollution represents an acute problem because it lowers the soil's capacity to regenerate. Over 99 % of the pollutants from the air, water, fauna and flora end up in the soil matrix, increasing the risk for contamination in the soil. To understand the influence heavy metals have on physical and chemical properties of the soil, this paper studies samples from two industrial contaminated areas in Mures County, Romania: (1) Azomures Fertilizers Plant and (2) Bicapa Factory.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{industrial}} activities involve the use and storage of many different chemicals that can run-off into water and pollute it. These chemicals {{have the potential to}} generate a variety of chronic or acute impacts on the environment by the features of reactive, toxic or flammable in form of vapour, gas and solid. During storage facilities, chemical discharge to atmosphere, water and soil causes contamination of land resources and water in aquatic environment. Due to differences in industrial production and storage methods, the characters and amounts of waste water varies with the development of industry. So, wastewater treatment strategies for these differences should be identified separately. Therefore the usage of Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) process supported with chemical preliminary precipitation is considered as a practical and economically solution for such industries.

Recent epidemiological {{studies have suggested that}} typical Asian diets, which have always been much higher in these substances than Western diets, appear to be associated with a significantly lower risk of breast, prostate and colon cancer as well as a reduced incidence of heart disease and osteoporosis. The benefits of phytoestrogens to good health and against several disorders are mainly due to the effects they have on the body’s hormonal balance, acting as both agonists and antagonists. Phytoestrogens are thought to act as estrogen agonists by occupying estrogen receptor sites when natural estrogens are unavailable. Phytoestrogens are also thought to act as estrogen antagonists by occupying estrogen receptor sites ahead of the body’s natural estrogens and equally importantly ahead of synthetic estrogens and also environmental estrogens derived <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> otherwise known as bad estrogens or xenoestrogens.

40|$|In view of {{the ability}} of neurotensin (NT) to {{increase}} glutamate release, the role of NT receptor mechanisms in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) -induced neuronal degeneration in cortical cultures has been evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity with 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide levels, and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) immunoreactivity. Apoptotic nerve cell death was analyzed measuring chromatin condensation with Hoechst 33258, annexin V staining, and caspase- 3 activity. Furthermore, the involvement of glutamate excitotoxicity in the neurodegeneration-enhancing actions of NT was analyzed by measurement of extracellular glutamate levels. NT enhanced the OGD-induced increase of LDH, endogenous extracellular glutamate levels, and apoptotic nerve cell death. In addition, the peptide enhanced the OGD-induced loss of mitochondrial functionality and increase of MAP 2 aggregations. These effects were blocked by the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR 1) antagonist SR 48692. Unexpectedly, the antagonist at 100 nM counteracted not only the NT effects but also some OGD-induced biochemical and morphological alterations. These results suggest that NTR 1 receptors may participate in neurodegenerative events induced by OGD in cortical cultures, used as an in vitro model of cortical ischemia.

Watershed scale models that tie anthropogenic, geochemical, and hydrologic activity to changes in chemical water quality are widely used to develop TMDLs and policy mechanisms to restore water quality. Current trends in water quality monitoring of streams and lakes have <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> sampling (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen) to biological sampling due to the low resource requirement and the ability to capture long-term water quality of biological sampling.

In order to account for a range of water body impairments, three different watersheds will be modeled: non-impacted, slightly impacted, and severely impacted.

40|$|Devices {{that could}} be {{characterized}} as acoustically driven molecular sieves have been proposed for filtering water to remove all biological contaminants and all molecules larger than water molecules. Originally intended for purifying wastewater for reuse aboard spacecraft, these devices could also be attractive for use on Earth in numerous settings {{in which there are}} requirements to obtain potable, medical-grade, or otherwise pure water from contaminated water supplies. These devices could also serve as efficient means of removing some or all water <b>from</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> for example, they might be useful as adjuncts or substitutes for stills in the removal of water from alcohols and alcoholic beverages. These devices may be constructed using various materials, such as ceramics, metallics, or polymers, depending on end-use requirements. A representative device of this type (see figure) would include a polymeric disk, about 1 mm in diameter and between 1 and 40 microns thick, within which would be embedded single-wall carbon nanotubes aligned along the thickness axis. The polymeric disk would be part of a unitary polymeric ring assembly. An acoustic transducer {{in the form of a}} piezoelectric-film-and-electrode subassembly - typically 9 microns thick and made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) coated with copper 150 nm thick -. would be affixed to the outside of the outer polymeric ring by means of an electrically nonconductive epoxy. The nanotubes would be chosen to have diameters between about 8 and about 13. 5 A because water molecules could fit into the nanotubes, but larger molecules could not. Water to be purified would be placed in contact with one face (typically, the upper face) of the filter disk. The surface tension of water is low enough that water molecules should enter and travel along the nanotubes, and computational simulations of molecular dynamics and experimental measurements have shown that the water molecules inside the nanotubes in this size range can be expected to become aligned into helical columns that exhibit properties of both hexagonal ice crystals and liquid wate...|$|R
