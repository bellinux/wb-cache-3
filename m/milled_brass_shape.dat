5000|$|Early in the 20th century, Scottdale was {{the center}} of the Frick coke interests. It had steel and iron pipe <b>mills,</b> <b>brass</b> and silver works, a casket factory, a large milk-pasteurizing plant, and machine shops; all of the {{aforementioned}} are presently defunct. Scottdale is notable for its economic decline from a formerly prosperous coke-town into an archetypal Rust Belt town. Duraloy Technologies, [...] "a supplier of specialty high alloy, centrifugal and static cast components and assemblies" [...] is the last remnant of Scottdale's steel related prosperity.|$|R

5000|$|Chadwick {{constructed}} {{his first}} mobile around 1947 - which originated from ideas first proposed by Rodney Thomas. Very {{few of these}} works survive; {{they were made of}} wire, balsa wood and cut copper and <b>brass</b> <b>shapes,</b> often fish-like and sometimes coloured. Some were incorporated as decorative features in exhibition stands, while others found homes amongst Thomas and his circle. Later he developed ground supports for the mobiles, transforming them into what he called [...] "stabiles". At the same time, he was designing fabrics and furniture.|$|R
50|$|Before {{construction}} began, 118,000 tons {{of contaminated}} soil and 63 vacant and deteriorated buildings {{were removed from}} the site. The construction of <b>Brass</b> <b>Mill</b> Center essentially replaced the older Naugatuck Valley Mall, built in 1969 and located on the city's northeast suburban side. In the process, the Filene's (originally a G. Fox & Co. store) and the Sears stores relocated to <b>Brass</b> <b>Mill</b> Center. Naugautuck Valley Mall was demolished in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Kenneth Alwyn's early stereo {{recording}} for Decca used {{a recording}} of slowed-down gunfire instead of cannon fire. Robert Sharples and the London Festival Orchestra released a recording in 1963, later remastered in quadrophony by Decca. The Black Dyke <b>Mills</b> <b>Brass</b> Band has also recorded a brass band arrangement of the piece. This recording on their album Symphonic Brass includes the cannon shots as originally written. In 1990, during a worldwide celebration of the 150th anniversary of Tchaikovsky's birth, the Overture was recorded {{in the city of}} his youth by the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra using 16 muzzleloading cannons fired live as written in the 1880 score. That recording was done within earshot of the composer's grave. The festival was televised {{for the first time in}} USA on March 9, 1991.|$|R

50|$|The city rapidly industrialized in the late-19th century, {{and became}} a {{manufacturing}} center producing such goods as the famous Bridgeport <b>milling</b> machine, <b>brass</b> fittings, carriages, sewing machines, saddles, and ammunition. Some employers took steps beyond paying wages {{for the benefit of}} their employees, such as the Warner Brothers Corset Company which built the Seaside Institute as a social and educational facility for its women workers.|$|R
50|$|The first Annie Award trophy {{was given}} {{out in the}} second awards {{ceremony}} to Walter Lantz, the founder of Walter Lantz Productions and creator of Woody Woodpecker.

5000|$|In 1834, Israel Coe, a Connecticut farmer; John Hungerford, a Connecticut businessman; and Anson Greene Phelps, {{co-founder of}} the Phelps Dodge mining company, founded a <b>brass</b> <b>mill</b> in Wolcottville, Connecticut (now known as Torrington, Connecticut). The <b>brass</b> <b>mill</b> {{manufactured}} kettles and {{a limited number of}} brass buttons. The manufacturing works and most of the skilled workers had to be imported from Great Britain. This was not without significant physical danger, as British companies did not wish to lose their competitive edge and market share. Some skilled workers left England hidden in wooden casks. In 1841, the company went public: $51,000 in stock was issued to Coe, Hungerford and Phelps, and the company name changed to the Wolcottville Brass Company. The company now began to produce mostly rolled and sheet brass.Anson Phelps purchased a large parcel of land at what is now Ansonia, Connecticut, in 1844. He founded the town of Ansonia, and built a dam across the Naugatuck River. He also built a canal and water reservoirs, and established a copper rolling mill. Phelps named the new company the Ansonia Brass and Battery Company ("battery" [...] being the term then in use for hammering sheets of metal into kettles). Phelps later added a <b>brass</b> <b>mill</b> and a <b>brass</b> wire <b>mill,</b> and in 1869 added the manufacture of clocks to the company's business. On January 1, 1878, the clock business was spun off as the Ansonia Clock Company. In 1863, Lyman W. Coe, brother of Israel Coe, founded the Coe Brass Manufacturing Company in Torrington.|$|R
5000|$|... "Latten" [...] also {{refers to}} a type of tin plating on iron (or {{possibly}} some other base metal), which is known as white latten; and black latten refers to laten-brass, which is <b>brass</b> <b>milled</b> into thin plates or sheets.|$|R
50|$|A bottle-jack was a {{clockwork}} motor in a <b>brass</b> shell, <b>shaped</b> like a bottle; it {{was introduced}} in the late 18th Century and in many case replaced the earlier and much more simple dangle spit. Dangle spits are still used by re-enactors, but are no longer made except as one-offs; bottle jacks ceased being manufactured in the early 20th Century.|$|R
40|$|Copper-catalyzed mechanochemical click {{reactions}} {{have been}} successfully implemented to provide novel 6 -phenyl- 2 - (trifluoromethyl) quinolones with phenyl- 1, 2, 3 - triazole moiety at O- 4 of quinolone core. Milling procedures utilizing CuI and <b>brass</b> <b>milling</b> balls {{proved to be more}} efficient than one using Cu(OAc) 2, as a copper source. While solvent-free milling methods were unaffected by the presence of the p-substituted azides, solvent-based conventional methods were strongly dependent on electronic structure of azides. In situ Raman monitoring of the milling processes using the Cu(0) catalysts in form of <b>brass</b> <b>milling</b> media enabled direct insight into the reaction pathway of mechanochemical CuAAC reactions indicating that the catalysis is most likely conducted on the surface of milling balls...|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{entering}} the Cabinet, Baldrige was {{chairman and chief}} executive officer of Scovill, Inc., Waterbury, Connecticut. Having joined Scovill in 1962, he is credited with leading its transformation to a highly diversified manufacturer of consumer, housing and industrial goods from a financially troubled <b>brass</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|R

Fox.|$|R
50|$|Weston cut is a {{man made}} channel, opened in 1727, for boats to {{approach}} and pass through Weston lock, which created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island named after {{the owner of the}} <b>brass</b> <b>mill</b> established on the river side in the early 18th century.|$|R
25|$|By 1746 an {{integrated}} <b>brass</b> <b>mill</b> {{was working at}} Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton (whose Soho Manufactory was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.|$|R
50|$|The party {{aimed to}} expand the {{existing}} complex basis (i.e., mining, milling, smelting and refining, processing activities) to first level manufacturing processing industries and second level manufacturing industries, e.g., stainless steel work, nickel plating, zinc galvanizing, wire and cable works, copper and <b>brass</b> <b>mills,</b> secondary smelting, die casting, sand casting, foundries, iron and steel work, brasses, bronzes alloys, nickel alloys, alloys steels.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{bought a}} paper {{manufacturer}} (the Ecusta Paper Company in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina), a lead shot facility, an explosive primer facility, a cartridge brass manufacturing facility, and a fiber wad facility.

Through it, the Olins {{made a fortune}} supplying ammunition during World War I.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main product}} {{line of the}} Dry Dock Engine Works was marine engines, and they {{produced}} 129 engines between 1867 and 1894. [...] However, the firm also produced stationary and portable steam engines, as well as mining equipment, <b>mill</b> gearing, and <b>brass</b> and iron casting. [...] In 1883, Dry Dock Engine Works bought the nearby boiler shop of Desotell & Hudson, expanding their product line.|$|R
