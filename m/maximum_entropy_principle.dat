If we consider the marble and bowl to be an isolated system, then when the marble drops, the potential energy will be converted to the kinetic energy of motion of the marble.

40|$|The <b>Maximum</b> <b>Entropy</b> Production <b>Principle</b> (MEPP) {{seems to}} be {{restricted}} to reproducible dissipative structures.

Whether the concept of MEPP can be applied to life depends on the reproducibility of biological evolution and therefore on our ability to distinguish the quirky from the generic features of life.
