40|$|Conformance test, that is {{the test}} that {{implementations}} comply with given specifications, is a wide area of growing significance wherever standards and <b>multisupplier</b> environments are becoming more common place. In this paper we give an overview of conformance testing activities which have either taken place within the ESPRIT Project CNMA or have resulted from such activities. In particular, conformance testing for CNMA Phase 4 at the ISW pilot site, conformance test for the OSI Network Management Forum, and the marketing of the test tools are covered. Finally, accreditation and certification issues are dealt with...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{defines the}} architectural concepts {{and principles of}} the SEMATECH Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Framework and provides architectural guidelines for CIM Framework component designers and implementers. The CIM Framework architecture is a component architecture based on the Object Management Group’s (OMG) distributed object computing infrastructure (the OMG’s Object Management Architecture [OMA]). The Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Application Framework Specification 1. 3 (Technology Transfer # 93061697 F-ENG) defines application components in this architecture that are useful in manufacturing execution system (MES) applications for semiconductor manufacturing. The architecture defines specific services that enable application component interoperation, substitution, extension, and reuse. This provides the basic computing structure for open, <b>multisupplier</b> MES implementations. The CIM Framework architecture definition is evolving, and this document identifies {{a number of issues}} and further tasks to mature the architecture from its current 0. 7 version to a more complete and robust 1. 0 version which will define the architectural foundation for CIM Framework Specification 2. 0...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{two-stage}} optimization method for emergency supplies allocation problem with <b>multisupplier,</b> multiaffected area, multirelief, and multivehicle. The triplet of supply, demand, {{and the availability}} of path is unknown prior to the extraordinary event and is descriptive with fuzzy random variable. Considering the fairness, timeliness, and economical efficiency, a multiobjective expected value model is built for facility location, vehicle routing, and supply allocation decisions. The goals of proposed model aim to minimize the proportion of demand nonsatisfied and response time of emergency reliefs and the total cost of the whole process. When the demand {{and the availability of}} path are discrete, the expected values in the objective functions are converted into their equivalent forms. When the supply amount is continuous, the equilibrium chance in the constraint is transformed to its equivalent one. To overcome the computational difficulty caused by multiple objectives, a goal programming model is formulated to obtain a compromise solution. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution method...|$|E
40|$|Supply Hub {{is defined}} as the {{horizontal}} coordination among the suppliers while lateral transshipment is a horizontal coordination policy among the retailers. By considering the Supply Hub and lateral transshipment simultaneously, ones can reduce the total cost of the supply chain system and improve the response to customer requirement and the customers’ satisfaction. We investigate the distribution policies for the supply chain which consists of <b>multisuppliers,</b> single Supply Hub, and multidistributors. In the system, both Supply Hub and distributors adopt the (t, S) policy, Supply Hub will not be out of stock, and backlogging is forbidden. Customer requirements at distributors are assumed to be independent random variables complying with uniform distribution; transshipment is assumed to be bidirectional, instantaneous, and emergent. We establish the distribution models, respectively, for the cases of transshipment or no transshipment. For the case with transshipment, we design a GA-based solution method involving a two-stage selection technology, that is, firstly, selecting individuals from parent population to generate offspring chromosomes and, secondly, selecting individuals from the interim population comprising all of the parent and offspring genomes, to form the next-generation population. We show that lateral transshipment can increase the overall profit of the supply chain by the comparison examinations between the models with and without transshipment...|$|R
40|$|TELIDES (1997) {{deal with}} a general {{approach}} to multipurpose batch plants planning. The methodology consists of two steps. It commences {{with the development of}} a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model to describe the all over dynamic behavior including food production bounds. More precisely, the different stages applied to the design of an object-oriented DES are presented. Then the global simulation tool is coupled with a stochastic optimization procedure to solve efficiently the production planning problem of a highly combinatorial nature. LOZA-GARAY & FLORES (2000) and POSNER & HIBBS (1997) focus on the flow characteristics of the product through the flour mill at the total flow rate. This is considered following a flow with normal distribution variations. The model describes the flow of total matter in a stochastic (probabilistic) analysis. The mass flow is linked directly to wheat attributes and to the specific process conditions of the pilot mill. Production planning in fish processing factories is marred by uncertainty in both the demand for final goods and the supply of raw fish. The SLAM II discrete event simulation model is used to study the potential of <b>multisupplier</b> sourcing as a strategy for minimizing stock related costs under variable demand and variable supply yield (HARVEY & KWEKU-MUATA 2000). MINEGISHI and THIEL (2000) discuss the comprehensio...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} a newsvendor that is served by multiple suppliers, where any given supplier is defined to be either perfectly reliable or unreliable. By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, {{as is the case}} in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier's reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier's order depends on its reliability. newsvendor, supplier diversification, random yield, <b>multisupplier</b> sourcing, procurement, disruption management...|$|E
40|$|Businesses {{increasingly}} {{offer their}} services electronically via the Web. Take for example an Internet Service Provider. An ISP {{offers a variety}} of services, including raw bandwidth, IP connectivity, and Domain Name resolution. Although in some cases a single service already satisfies a customer need, in many situations a customer need is so complex that a bundle of services is needed to satisfy the need, as with the ISP example. In principle, each service in a bundle can be provisioned by a different supplier. This paper proposes an ontology, e 3 service, {{that can be used to}} formally capture customer needs, services, and <b>multisupplier</b> service bundles of these. In addition, this paper contributes a process called PCM 2 to reason with the ontology. First, a customer need is identified for which desired consequences are elicited. Then, the desired set of consequences is matched with consequences associated with services. The matching process results in a service bundle, satisfying the customer need, containing services that each can be provided by different suppliers. PCM 2 is inspired by a family of formal reasoning methods called Propose-Critique-Modify (PCM). However, whereas PCM methods emphasize solution generation from a given set of requirements, our reasoning process treats the space of requirements as a first class citizen. Hence PCM 2 : the requirements space and solution space are equally important. How the reasoning and matching process practically works, is illustrated by an industry strength case study in the healthcare domain...|$|E
40|$|In today’s practice, we see readily precomposed {{commercial}} service bundles, {{such as a}} spam-free email box, consisting of more elementary services like mail storage and a spamfilter. However, these bundles may be suboptimal from the customer’s perspective in terms of price and/or the elementary services that constitute the bundle. It would be advantageous to the customer if a service bundle more closely fulfilled the customer’s individual requirements, by selecting the most appropriate elementary services included in the bundle. Also, by obtaining the bundle from a consortium of suppliers, rather than just one single supplier, the elementary services of each supplier with the best cost/benefit ratio can be selected. To put this vision into reality, we need middleware facilitating the automated composition of <b>multisupplier</b> bundles out of basic {{commercial service}}s available online. We take the stand that the business nature of commercial services imposes leading requirements on the technical design of the middleware. Most importantly, the middleware should be fair {{in the sense that}} no single supplier obtains a preferred position in terms of service selection to satisfy a specific customer need. Also, the middleware should {{be able to deal with}} alternative services as offered by many competing suppliers, not to speak about the combinatoric explosion, resulting from combining the available services into candidate services bundles. We present a list of problems to be solved to arrive at middleware for multi-supplier service selection, bundling and provisioning. Also, we review existing work, usable to build a fair and efficient middleware solution for commercial service provisioning...|$|E
