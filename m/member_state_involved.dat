40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterium, {{widely distributed}} in the environment; morover, its ability to survive at low temperatures and form protective biofilms makes it colonise and persist in food processing plants. Epidemiological data provided by EFSA in 2009 show that ready-to-eat (RTE) food – in particular, soft and semi-soft cheese, and fishery and meat products subjected to heat treatment –represents the most likely contaminated foodstuff. For this reason, the European Commission has developed (Dec. 2010 / 678 /EU) a monitoring plan designed to evaluate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in these products. The programme, developed in detail with reference to each <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>involved,</b> among others, the city of Turin and has been set out from June to December 2011.

40|$|Energy {{independence}} was a long-time dream of European <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> thus numerous regulations and actions were designed specific for its implementation. In a society characterized by constant evolution, energy independence {{is regarded as}} a proof of the existence of coherent supranational strategies, but also as a necessary effort that is to be unravelled at national level. Unlike the first actions in the energy sector, the current market is the expression of a competitive space that has adapted an approach depending upon efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, I present, using a macro-level approach, the transformations of the European energy market and the challenges that arise. I examine both the actions that lead to the liberalization efforts, as well as the disparities that characterize the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved</b> in this process. Therefore, I question the process of liberalization of the energy market as being a straight-forward one and I investigate the variables (such as types of energy and national energy strategies) that directly influence this process.

40|$|The {{draft for}} a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Directive in the European Union {{includes}} the suggestion for an apportionment formula which allocates taxable group profits to group member corporations. These allocated profits shall then be taxed in the respective <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The draft directive delegates {{the right to}} define one factor of the apportionment formula, the term "Employee" to the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> who are therefore free to choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach the paper shows that the individually rational strategy of any <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> to define "Employee" broadly so as to maximize {{the volume of the}} apportionment factor and thus maximize the allocated share of taxable income is only the best solution when tax rate differences and differences in the volume of atypical employment schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the corporate groups' reactions to different Member States' definitions are included in modelling the game's pay-offs a narrow definition of "Employee" yields the highest individual pay-offs to the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved.</b> This change of dominant strategies is triggered by the corporate group's shifting of the employment factor from high-tax to low-tax <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB apportionment formula as it is the first paper identifying and analysing the employment factor and its distorting effects. The paper discusses possible tax minimizing strategies for corporate groups by shifting workforce and develops a model to quantify these potential relocations. Furthermore the paper presents advice to policy makers in their "Employee" definition decision and shows how <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> could use this definition to both minimize outward factor shifting and maximize inward factor shifting.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of contemporary European policy-making is public participation. The European Commission increasingly mandates its <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to <b>involve</b> the general public in policy-making through public participation. Public participation is generally considered to improve the legitimacy and democracy of the policy-making process and its outcomes. However, mandated public participation creates severe difficulties for <b>member</b> <b>states</b> whose policy-making process may be characterized as a (neo) corporatist system of interest representation. This paper presents {{the case of the}} implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in the Netherlands, aiming to highlight these difficulties, to provide an example of how a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> may cope with forced public participation in a (neo) corporatist environment, and to question whether and, if so, how mandated public participation actually results in a more democratic and legitimate policy-making process...|$|R
40|$|Conflicts of {{criminal}} jurisdiction between the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> {{belong to the}} most difficult challenges that the European Union has to face {{in order to establish}} a true “area of freedom, security and justice”. This article starts with an analysis of the interests that are affected by such conflicts: on the one hand, they are most problematic for the individual because they can lead to repeated or simultaneous proceedings in different <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and forum shopping by prosecution authorities. What is more, they can even make it impossible to foresee whether and how severely an act will be punished. Thus, essential criminal law and procedure guarantees like ne bis in idem, the principle of legality, the right to a court established by law as well as the right to an effective defence are jeopardised. On the other, the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved</b> often have a legitimate interest in prosecution—or non-prosecution—and risk to spend their financial and personnel resources for ineffective parallel proceedings. In order to avoid conflicts {{of criminal}} jurisdiction, various models are conceivable. However, the most convincing one—according to the author’s opinion—builds upon a combination of different elements: a hierarchy of jurisdictional links should form the basis, but {{it would have to be}} complemented with provisions allowing for more flexibility in precisely defined circumstances. With this in mind, this article calls for the adoption of an EU regulation in order to solve the most urgent problems arising from conflicts of criminal jurisdiction and makes concrete suggestions as to its drafting...|$|R

40|$|The arm’s length {{principle}} {{has a new}} function. When used by the European Union (EU) Commission for State aid control purposes, it {{is aimed}} at protecting {{a level playing field}} for all economic operators in the internal market, i. e. at protecting free competition, rather than at tax base protection or prevention of double taxation. In that function, it is part of competition law, rather than of tax law. It may, therefore, deviate from the traditional Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) understanding of that principle. The case law on which the Commission relies, is not very explicit, and {{it remains to be seen}} whether the EU Courts will endorse the Commission’s approach, but from a competition law perspective, that approach makes sense. Both from the Belgian excess profits scheme case and the Apple case, it transpires that the Commission is of the opinion that a company cannot have stateless income. A branch State cannot suffice by saying ‘not in my yard’ if that implies that real income is allocated into a tax void, disappearing for tax purposes into a physically non-existent head office. Whether or not the EU Courts, if they accept the Commission’s approach, will also accept recovery ten years back with interest, will most likely depend on the question of whether, even if the Commission’s approach may be novel, the companies and the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved</b> should anyway have known better...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the producer exemption from paying transport charges {{in the light of}} European Union sector specific regulation and the European Union state aid rules. In the Netherlands and several other EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> the ministries and/or the energy authorities have decided that producers of electricity will not be charged for using the electricity network for the transport of electricity. These charges have to be paid to the network operator and thereby ensure that this network operator can recover the costs that are made to provide the transport service to the users of the network. EU law assumes that both producers and consumers are users of the electricity network. This article assesses whether exempting producers from contributing to the payment of the transport charges for using the electricity network is legal under European Union law. First, the relevant provisions from the Third Energy Package are examined. This legislative package does not provide strict rules with regard to the allocation of transport tariffs on the electricity market. It does however contain the principle of non-discrimination. The exact contours of this principle have not yet crystalized and it raises questions {{whether or not it is}} infringed by the producer exemptions. Secondly, the exemptions will be tested under the EU state aid doctrine. It is controversial whether or not the state aid rules are infringed by the exemption, as this will depend on the exact interpretation (broad or narrow) of the specific elements of the state aid rules. It would thus be useful that the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved</b> notify the measures to the European Commission, urging the latter to give more clarity on the legality of the producer exemption in the light of EU Law...|$|R

The deadlines for EDP abrogations will only be extended if extraordinary circumstances occur - like a recession or severe economic downturn.

40|$|The European Union’s “Digital Agenda for Europe, 2020 ” aims at 50 % {{penetration}} of electronic procurement in the EU. It also targets to achieve full e-procurement by the mid- 2016. However, considering the current use of e-procurement which stands just at 2 % across the border, it seems quite challenging {{to achieve this}} target. In the present hard financial times, there is pressure to utilize public budget in efficient and transparent manner. There is potential saving of 50 Billion euros {{with the use of}} public e-procurement in the EU. The biggest hurdle in achieving targeted e-procurement penetration in the EU is interaction between different EU systems. Interconnectivity may help us but interoperability is the real solution. However, achieving interoperability is not easy when there are several <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved.</b> Each of them having existing infrastructure and closed networks.

40|$|Cross-border {{division}} of companies with limited liability Cross-border {{division of}} companies with limited liability {{is the legal}} act pursuant to which a company, governed by the law of a state, divides – by legal division – {{as a consequence of}} which: (i) assets and liabilities of the dividing company transfer under universal title of succession by operation of law to one or more acquiring companies, that is (or are) governed by the law of another state; and (ii) the shareholders of the dividing company become shareholders of the acquiring company or companies. The acquiring company or companies may already exist prior to the division or can be newly formed in the framework of the cross-border division. The dividing company ceases to exist in the framework of the cross-border division (a “full division”) or continues to exist (a “partial division”). The law of the EU, as it stands, does not explicitly provide for written legislation on cross-border division. Only a few <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the EU drew up legislation on cross-border divisions. However, cross-border division is possible {{on the basis of the}} freedom of establishment (section 49 and section 54 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”)). The Court of Justice of the EC/EU confirmed that company transformation operations constitute particular methods of exercising the freedom of establishment. Also cross-border division falls within that scope. The freedom of establishment has a wide scope: it is applicable to all kind of companies that fall within the scope of section 54 TFEU and is applicable to all kind of corporate restructuring methods that are allowed under the national laws of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the EU. Although the scope of the freedom of establishment is wide, the freedom of establishment cannot “introduce” the possibility of cross-border division for companies that cannot be involved in a national division under the laws of a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> of the EU. As to the conflict of laws with respect to cross-border division, a “distinctive cumulative approach” should be followed: the laws applicable to the companies involved in the cross-border division will both be applied, but a distinction has to be made between certain parts of the cross-border division and the procedure upon cross-border division. Applying this “distinctive cumulative approach” results in a balanced application of the law applicable to the dividing company on the one hand and the law applicable to the acquiring company on the other hand: if the application of the law of one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> is sufficient, only the rules of the law of that <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> will be applied, but if the application of the laws of both <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>involved</b> is necessary, then the laws of both <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> must be applied. Although cross-border division is already possible, the EU legislator should draw up legislation on cross-border division. That will help companies to benefit from the internal market of the EU and will also improve the proper functioning of the internal market of the EU...|$|R
40|$|This chapter’s {{objective}} is to reflect on existing and impending challenges to European Union (EU) public law from both a constitutional and an administrative angle. The background to such an overview is that the EU law has radically changed in the past decades. Next to several Treaty amendments enlarging the scope of EU policies, the EU has grown substantially in size. European administrative law has evolved over time and has become an important factor shaping the reality of policy implementation in the EU. At the same time, EU public law remains complex due to the EU’s ‘variable geometry,’ according to which in some policy areas, such as for example the monetary Union, not all EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> participate, whilst in others, such as for example the common visa and travel area, non-EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are <b>involved.</b> In this chapter I argue that the evolving nature of European integration through law has both a constitutional law and administrative law context.

In particular, this research paper focuses the analysis on the political negotiations for the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) framework decision. The fine balance between security, freedom and justice in the newly enlarging Europe is being rigorously tested in the current pervasive climate of fear, which is fuelled by the "global threats" of terrorism and cross-border crime. The negotiations for the European Arrest Warrant provide an excellent example of how these contrasting pressures can play out within the arena of EU policy making. In {{the first part of this}} paper, the historical context for the emergence of the European Arrest Warrant negotiations is presented. The next section presents the analytical approach used in this research, which involved the application and comparison of different explanations or models of policy making. Since the 1980 s, several models of collective decision making have been developed that provide far reaching insights into the dynamics of decision making processes (for example Bueno de Mesquita et al 1985, Stokman and Van Oosten 1994). The main differences between the models concern the assumptions they make regarding the behaviour of the actors involved in the decision-making process. On the basis of the accuracy of the models’ forecasts of decision outcomes, we can make inferences about the relevance of the influence strategies posited. The empirical research first examined the policy preparatory stage at the national level and in particular focused on three small <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> Greece, Ireland and Finland. This research illustrates the strong cross-national differences that exist with regard to the level of centralisation, as well as the level of transparency, which characterises the processes of EU policy preparation in the JHA arena in each country. Following this, the analysis focused on the decision-making phase at the European level for the European Arrest Warrant. The application of the modelling approach allows an insight into the kind of bargaining across issues, as well as the likely gains and losses incurred by the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>involved</b> in these negotiations...|$|R
40|$|Since 2007, EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> {{have been}} <b>involved</b> in {{creating}} an {{infrastructure for spatial information}} in Europe (INSPIRE), {{based on a}} legal and technical interoperability framework. This paper presents some of the lessons learnt during the implementation of this infrastructure (which started in 2009) and during work on data and service interoperability coordinated with European and international initiatives. We describe a number of critical interoperability issues affecting both scientific and government data and metadata, and propose how these problems could be effectively addressed by a closer collaboration of the government and scientific communities, by taking advantage of their complementary competencies, and by influencing the development and adoption of standards.

40|$|United Nations Peace Operations and UN {{mandated}} Peace Enforcement Operations, {{which are}} usually conducted by regional organizations or ad hoc coalitions of States, are wholly dependent upon the voluntary contribution of troops by <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> This <b>involves</b> transferring parts of command authority to the United Nations or to the regional organization which has undertaken the mission under UN mandate, while other aspects of authority over the troops remain {{under the control of}} the State which is contributing its troops. This partial transfer of authority results in complex multilayered command structures which has given rise to certain legal and practical questions relating to the attribution of conduct in relation to allegations of possible violations of international law and the most appropriate remedies in such cases. This article provides an overview of the types of command structures most often used in both UN and UN mandated operations and explores the questions resulting from these in relation to attribution of conduct. It also discusses possible shortcomings in the provision of remedies and offers some suggestions as to how these might be addressed...|$|R
