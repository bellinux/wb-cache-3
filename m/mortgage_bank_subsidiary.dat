40|$|Mortgage {{companies}} (MCs) do {{not fall}} under the strict regulatory regime applicable to depository institutions. We empirically show that the resulting regulatory arbitrage allowed bank holding companies (BHCs) to circumvent capital requirements and avoid loan-related losses. MC subsidiaries of BHCs originated riskier <b>mortgages</b> (than <b>bank</b> <b>subsidiaries),</b> characterized by borrowers with lower credit scores, lower incomes, higher loan-to-income ratios, and higher default rates. Our results imply that regulation {{had the capacity to}} prevent the deterioration of pre-crisis lending standards, but only if consistently applied and enforced. The higher involvement of MCs in subprime lending and securitization do not explain our results...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis is creating stress on banking systems {{across the world}} through funding and asset quality shocks. This paper combines different stress scenarios, as well as cross-country analysis, to assess New Zealand bank vulnerabilities to the global crisis and the domestic recession. It finds that a sharp worsening of asset quality {{would be required to}} reduce bank capital below the regulatory minimum. On the funding side, a disruption to banks'' offshore funding may put pressure on the exchange rate, but would not trigger a systemic liquidity problem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} key {{findings of}} the Financial System Stability Assessment for New Zealand, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes on Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency, Banking Supervision, and Securities Regulation. The assessment reveals that New Zealand has a profitable and well-functioning financial system, operating in a framework of well-developed financial markets. Short-term risks to stability appear low, given the favorable macroeconomic outlook, and sound and transparent financial policies. Stress tests for systemically important banks show resilience consistent with the sector’s relatively high levels of capital and profits.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how competition among lenders affects mortgage loan characteristics.

Changes in market shares among lender types (local bank, nonlocal <b>bank,</b> or independent <b>mortgage</b> <b>bank)</b> that lead to higher loan risk also are associated with better borrower quality. In particular, increasing the local market share of a lender type raises loan risk and borrower quality at that lender type. ...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the first 50 {{years of the}} National <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bank</b> of Chile (Caja de Crédito Hipotecario) following its creation in 1855.

Despite the strong secular rise in credit during this period, the <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bank</b> had to confront large external shocks, including three sudden stops of foreign capital in 1857, 1873, and 1890.
