5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction {{of oil and gas}} and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E

Freshly cooked or canned tuna <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> <b>For</b> decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E
