25|$|While {{the state}} rooms {{occupied}} {{the northern and}} eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, {{the four corners of}} the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This {{is one of the reasons}} that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the Tsarevna, the arrangement of the rooms <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense.</b> Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the Tsarevich's and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.|$|E

500|$|... "Volcano" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode was inspired by volcano-related Hollywood disaster films, such as Dante's Peak (1997) and Volcano (1997), which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, [...] "If you watch this episode and then go watch Volcano, this <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> than Volcano does." [...] Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer {{at the time of the}} episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where [...] "anything can happen". Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the Volcano film was set in Los Angeles; Stone said, [...] "If they could do it, we could." [...] Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, [...] "Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are." ...|$|E

The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics.

It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie." [...] After the film's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client. The agency believed the scene was [...] "one step above pornography", and claimed that Sevigny's career [...] "may never recover". In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: [...] "No, I was always committed to the project {{on the strength of}} Vincent alone. I have faith in his aesthetic... I try to forgive and forget, otherwise I'd just become a bitter old lady." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead cited the need to provide area air defense and specific new threats such as ballistic missiles and the possession of anti-ship missiles by groups such as Hezbollah.
