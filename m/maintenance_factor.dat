40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringIn today's highly {{competitive}} business environment every company is heading {{to increase its}} overall production and profit by decreasing its consumed manufacturing cost. Reduction in manufacturing cost can be effectively achieved by means of reducing the non-value added costs and activities involved in the production process. Breakdown maintenance effectiveness plays {{a vital role in}} machines availability for production. Assessing breakdown maintenance activities helps an organization to organize and effectively streamline the maintenance actions carried out {{in order to reduce the}} consumption of input resources. In this research work, a method is proposed for assessing the breakdown <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors</b> using a value stream maintenance map (VSMM) enabling the assessment of measurable <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors.</b> To attain the proposed method, initially, various breakdown <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors</b> are identified and grouped. Then a breakdown maintenance performance measures hierarchy and a framework are developed in this thesis. Next a method which incorporates the calculation of key breakdown maintenance metrics and a VSMM along with the key breakdown maintenance metrics and their respective trends is detailed. Finally the proposed method is implemented in a hypothetical and three industrial case studies. This helps to record and assess the breakdown maintenance effectiveness of a production line and thus leading to continuous improvement opportunities. v...|$|R

This study uses a realist philosophy to analyse the issues that hinder or facilitate effective end-user participation in a successful maintenance of drinking-water projects in Nkhoma and Bvumbwe, Lilongwe and Thyolo Districts of Malawi respectively.

Participants completed questionnaires measuring severity of eating pathology, perceived voice power, and beliefs about voices, either at the start or during treatment. RESULTS: A more powerful anorexic voice was associated with more negative eating attitudes in this clinical group. However, BMI was related to a moderating effect, with the interaction of greater voice power and malevolence being associated with a lower BMI.

It is expressed as a cytosolic molecule in myelinating Schwann cells rather than in skeletal muscle in the postnatal period and therefore does not qualify as a target-derived neurotrophic factor regulating motoneuron survival during embryonic development.

Elg 1 forms the major subunit of a replication factor C-like complex, Elg 1 -RLC, which unloads the ring-shaped polymerase clamp PCNA from DNA during replication. Here, we show that prolonged retention of PCNA on DNA into G 2 /M phase is the major cause of genome instability in elg 1 Δ yeast. Overexpression-induced accumulation of PCNA on DNA causes genome instability. Conversely, disassembly-prone PCNA mutants that relieve PCNA accumulation rescue the genome instability of elg 1 Δ cells. Covalent modifications to the retained PCNA make only a minor contribution to elg 1 Δ genome instability. By engineering cell-cycle-regulated ELG 1 alleles, we show that abnormal accumulation of PCNA on DNA during S phase causes moderate genome instability and its retention through G 2 /M phase exacerbates genome instability. Our results reveal that PCNA unloading by Elg 1 -RLC is critical for genome maintenance...|$|E

40|$|Section A is a {{systematic}} review of emotional processing {{in people with}} Anorexia Nervosa (AN). By drawing together all self-report research, it outlines the specific emotional processing difficulties experienced by this population. It concludes that theoretical assertions that poor emotional processing maintains AN are tentatively empirically supported, but data is limited and largely cross-sectional. Section B Background. Effective treatments for AN in adults remain elusive. Recent research suggests poor socio-emotional and neurocognitive functioning may act as underpinning maintaining mechanisms for AN. These difficulties are therefore indicated as treatment targets; however, their roles as maintaining factors {{and the benefits of}} including socio-emotional and neurocognitive difficulties as foci for therapy lack empirical evidence. Methods. A randomised control trial design was employed to compare the Maudsley AN Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) based on a novel maintenance model of AN seeking to target key socio-emotional factors (maladaptive emotion beliefs and over-control of emotion, alongside poor social cognition) and neurocognitive factors (poor set-shifting and extreme detail-focus), against a control treatment mimicking treatment as usual (specialist supportive clinical management; SSCM). It was hypothesised that: (1) baseline socio-emotional and neurocognitive difficulties would predict outcomes, highlighting their role as maintenance factors; and (2) MANTRA would significantly improve these factors over SSCM leading to better clinical outcomes, therefore confirming them ‘causal’ <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors.</b> Results. Emotional avoidance (behavioural/cognitive avoidance, low acceptance) and some other elements of control (submissive behaviour) predicted clinical outcomes. Social cognitive (emotion recognition, emotional Theory of Mind) and neurocognitive functioning (set-shifting, detail-focus) had limited predictive ability. There were socio-emotional (social comparison, cognitive avoidance) and neurocognitive (set-shifting) improvements following MANTRA over SSCM, but no clinical advantage. Conclusions. Emotional avoidance and submissive behaviours may represent <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors</b> for AN. Social cognitive and neurocognitive variables appear less important. No ‘causal’ <b>maintenance</b> <b>factors</b> could be concluded from the data. Implications for adapting MANTRA are discussed. Section C is a critical appraisal of this research reflecting on key learning points and the limitations of the study, as well as the impact of the study on clinical work and in planning future research.
