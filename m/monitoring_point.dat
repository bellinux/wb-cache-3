30|$|Another {{important}} issue, in a non-uniform context, is the <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> location: it {{is crucial}} to have available information in spots with high peak TF values; in HE 1, several monitoring points have TFs with a very low peak value which means that monitoring locations provide very poor information about the pollutant event development and numerically they generated a matrix H that is ill-conditioned. This H matrix causes failing in the convergence procedure and consequently errors on the results. During the design of a monitoring network we suggest to consider the monitoring points that present the higher peak values of the TF. It {{is important to note that}} a <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> can have a high peak TF value and a zero concentration; this information is very important and allows to bound the plume.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceThis {{experiment}} was conducted from April to September in 2009 in Baotou-lake Farm of Korla city, Xinjiang region, China. Two experiment schemes {{were designed for}} analyzing the spatial variability and lateral orientation of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> for soil moisture. In scheme 1, 44 <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> were positioned with sampling depth of 0 ~ 60 cm. In scheme 2, 20 <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> were placed with sampling depth of 0 ~ 80 cm. Samples were taken in the whole cotton growing period before and after irrigation in both schemes. Statistical analyses including Q-Q test, descriptive statistics, t-test and geo-statistical analysis were performed to the soil moisture data. The {{results indicate that the}} increase of soil moisture can enhance their spatial variability. In drip-irrigated cotton cultivation, spatial variability of soil moisture resulted from the combination of several random variables and the structural factors such as climate, topography, soil form. Semi-variogram models belong to spherical model and the range of spherical model for soil moisture is about 9. 40 m~ 35. 35 m. The accuracy of the fitted model decreases as the soil moisture content increases. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> should be placed at the range of 0 ~ 0. 475 m from the drip tape and it is not suitable to place them at a farther place.

Without a representative monitoring network of reliable <b>monitoring</b> <b>points,</b> there is a risk that groundwater management policies could be developed and implemented based on poor evidence. To help increase confidence in nitrate data, a robust, practical and repeatable method was developed to assess the effectiveness of groundwater nitrate monitoring networks, and applied to a network in Scotland. The method combines a rapid site assessment of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> and local pollution pressures in order to judge the reliability of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points,</b> with a wider characterization of the network to identify which land uses and hydrogeological environments are being monitored. The analysis indicates that, with minor exceptions, Scotland's groundwater nitrate monitoring network broadly represents the diversity of conditions expected in Scotland. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Voltage sag {{is among}} the major power quality {{disturbances}} that can cause substantial loss of product and also can attribute to malfunctions, instabilities and shorter lifetime of the load. Accurate voltage sag source location can help to minimize the loss and problems caused by voltage sag in a power distribution system. This paper presents a development of a current component index (CCI) algorithm to locate the source of voltage sag in a power distribution system. The product of the RMS current and the power factor angle at the <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> is employed for the sag source location. A graph of this product against time is plotted. The voltage sag source location is determined by examining {{the magnitude of the}} current component index {{at the beginning of the}} sag. If the magnitude of the CCI during sag is higher than the magnitude of CCI before sag, it indicates that the voltage sag source is in front of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>point.</b> On the other hand if the magnitude of the CCI during sag is lower than the magnitude of CCI before sag, it indicates that the voltage sag source is in behind the <b>monitoring</b> <b>point.</b> The proposed method has been verified by simulations on a radial distribution system. Comparative studies with other method namely, the slope of the line fitting parameters of current and voltage method were also conducted in order to highlight the strength of the proposed method V Index Terms — Voltage sag, Single source, current...|$|E
