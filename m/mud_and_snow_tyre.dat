50|$|The {{range of}} Long John style cargobikes extends to {{off-road}} applications. Such designs can cover difficult terrain such as sand, <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> by using fatbike tires, electric motors, and suitable ground clearance. This brings cargobikes into farms, national parks, 1st-response situations, and immunization programs.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated winter tires {{will bear}} the [...] "Mountain/Snowflake Pictograph" [...] if {{designated}} as a winter/snow tire by the American Society for Testing & Materials. Winter tires will typically also carry the designation MS, M&S, or the words <b>MUD</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SNOW</b> (but see All-season tires, below).|$|R
50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>Snow,</b> (or M+S, or M&S), is a for all-season {{and winter}} tires {{designed}} to provide improved traction on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice, compared to summer tires. These tires have a more aggressive tread along at least one edge of the tire, designed to engage a snowy surface.|$|R
5000|$|Raupenschlepper Ost, {{literally}} [...] "Caterpillar Tractor East", is {{more commonly}} abbreviated to RSO. This fully tracked, lightweight vehicle was conceived {{in response to}} the poor performance of wheeled and half-tracked vehicles in the <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> during the Wehrmacht's first autumn and winter on the Soviet Front.|$|R

[...] "Is not this much better than your <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> {{the sight of the}} men with anxious faces groping through the fog? Vaya! You men of the English cities, you not know how to live." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{missiles}} for {{the most}} part fell wide of the mark. Still! the numbers might tell in the end. Socrates' face was streaming with blood: a clump of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> had extinguished one of the torches, and a moment ago a stone had caught Diogenes on the left shoulder.|$|R

60|$|A poor brokendown {{drunkard}} {{returned to}} his dilapidated domicile early on New Year's morn. The great bells of the churches were jarring the creamy moonlight which lay above the soggy undercrust of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> As he heard their joyous peals, announcing {{the birth of a}} new year, his heart smote his old waistcoat like a remorseful sledge-hammer.|$|R
50|$|Treads {{are often}} {{designed}} to meet specific product marketing positions. High-performance tires have small void ratios to provide more rubber {{in contact with the}} road for higher traction, but may be compounded with softer rubber that provides better traction, but wears quickly. <b>Mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> (M&S) tires are designed with higher void ratios to channel away rain <b>and</b> <b>mud,</b> while providing better gripping performance.|$|R
50|$|Tread voids provide {{space for}} the lug to flex and deform as it enters and exits the footprint. Voids also provide {{channels}} for rainwater, <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> to be channeled away from the footprint. The void ratio is the void area of the tire divided by the entire tread area. Low void areas have high contact area and therefore higher traction on clean, dry pavement.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>snowing</b> slowly <b>and</b> persistently, as it {{had done}} all day, when Henry Alton of Somasco ranch stood {{struggling}} with a half-tamed Cayuse pony in a British Columbian settlement. The Cayuse had laid its ears back, and was describing a circle round him, scattering <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> while the man who gripped the bridle in a lean, brown hand watched it without impatience, admiringly.|$|R
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{does not}} sell to {{automobile}} manufacturers, but instead {{concentrates on the}} more profitable consumer <b>tyre</b> replacement <b>and</b> premium <b>snow</b> <b>tyre</b> markets. Nokian Tyres has the highest market share of the Finnish passenger car tyre market. The Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian markets contributed over 40% of Nokian Tyres' corporate net sales in 2008.|$|R

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Jack drove {{his mother to}} the Captain's, confiding {{to her on the}} way what a hard time he had when he went before, and how nothing but the thought of cheering Bob kept him up when he slipped and hurt his knee, and his boot sprung a leak, and the wind came up very cold, and the hill seemed an endless mountain of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of half-tracks over wheeled vehicles {{is that the}} tracks reduced the pressure on any given area of the ground by spreading the vehicle's weight over a larger area, which gives it greater mobility over soft terrain like <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> while they do not require the complex steering mechanisms of fully tracked vehicles, relying instead on their front wheels to direct the vehicle, augmented in some cases by track braking controlled by the steering wheel.|$|R
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> tires <b>and</b> the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|R
5000|$|Timber is {{commonly}} grown in hilly country unsuitable for farming {{and so the}} ability of a log truck to climb a gradient is significant. The steepness depends {{on the quality of the}} surface - <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> are harder to climb than gravel and soil. For a manageable gradient, the speed will then depend upon the power of the truck. [...] The legal weight limits will vary by jurisdiction but, for example, in the southern states of the USA, they range from 80000 to 88000 lb [...] - [...] about 40 ST.|$|R
50|$|Dan Prosser {{subsequently}} founded his own online publication, <b>Mud,</b> <b>Snow</b> <b>and</b> Tar.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{establish}} snow emergency routes by restrict-ing the use of certain highways during periods of snow or ice emergency to vehicles which are properly equipped to minimize the safety hazard. § 213. 2. Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the fol-lowing meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: Department—The Department of Transportation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Limited access highway—A highway in respect to which owners or occu-pants of abutting lands and other persons have no legal right of access except at points and in the manner determined by the authority having jurisdiction over the highway. <b>Mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> tire—A tire which, when, compared with conventional rib-type passenger car tires, has a relatively aggressive tread pattern and is designed primarily to provide additional starting, stopping, and driving traction in <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> The tread shall also have ribs, lugs, blocks, or buttons, be generally discontinuous, and have the following characteristics when inflated: (i) A {{substantial portion of the}} lug, block, or rib edges in the tread design shall be at an angle greater than 30 ° to the tire circumferential center line. (ii) On at least one side of the tread design, the shoulder lugs shall pro-trude at least 1 / 2 inch in a direction generally perpendicular to the direction of travel...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1943–4, 78th Division was {{transferred}} to 5th US Army {{in front of the}} Gustav Line, where the engineers' main task was to maintain and improve the mountain roads. It was the same in front of the Gothic Line the following autumn: as 78th Division slowly advanced towards the River Po it relied on a minor road codenamed 'Ace' that had to be constantly repaired kept clear of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> When it collapsed, the divisional and corps engineers had to be reinforced by a US engineer [...] battalion before it could be repaired.|$|R
50|$|The Beretta 92F survived {{exposure}} to temperatures from -40 to 140 F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds. That number is often {{touted as the}} equivalent to {{five or six times}} the pistol's service life. While this is normally true in European militaries, armed forces of the United States normally subject sidearms to much more extensive use. The Iraq War, which featured frequent urban and room-to-room combat, has required American soldiers to rely more heavily on their pistols.|$|R
5000|$|To simplify {{production}} {{some were}} {{mounted on the}} two-wheel split-trail carriage from the 10 cm le K 41 (10 cm Leichte Kanone 41) field gun, resulting in a version known as Pak 43/41. The 43/41 proved heavy and awkward to handle in the <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> of the Eastern Front and gunners referred to 43/41 as the [...] "barn door" [...] (Scheunentor), {{a reference to the}} size and weight of the gun. Nevertheless, the improvised Pak 43/41 proved an effective substitute for the Pak 43 until sufficient of the more complex cruciform mounts could be manufactured to replace it in service.|$|R
50|$|A car mat is {{designed}} to help protect a vehicle's carpeted floors. One major use of a car mat is to keep <b>mud,</b> sand <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> from contacting the carpeted floors. Some require fixation points to ensure they remain fixed in position.|$|R
50|$|However, by that time, young Lundy {{had moved}} to Wheeling, Virginia (now in West Virginia). In 1808 he was apprenticed to a saddler. On the Ohio River, Wheeling was on {{important}} transit point of the interstate slave trade, with coffles of slaves often marched through town. Many would be shipped down the Ohio River toward Kentucky (a slave state) and additional slave states down the Mississippi River. In Wheeling, Lundy saw firsthand many iniquities inherent in the institution of slavery, {{including the use of}} horsewhips and bludgeons to force barefoot human beings to walk through <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> He determined to devote his life to the cause of abolition.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 95 could {{accommodate}} 3 persons - two in {{the front}} and one in the back. The two-cylinder, V-twin, four-stroke, air-cooled gasoline engine, which developed [...] @ 3,300rpm, was an advantage in cold climates encountered in China and it had 4-wheel drive, using a gearshift activated transfer case to engage the front wheels. It was manufactured without weapons and unarmored. It had advantages over the Type 97 motorcycle used by the Japanese Army, which was limited by not being able to negotiate off-road conditions, and limited troop mobility capabilities. It had tall, narrow wheels which helped it to travel over rough terrain, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{considered}} fast, sufficiently reliable (after some technical problems were solved) and armed and armored well enough for reconnaissance missions. However, cavalry units criticized its off-road performance, which {{was even worse}} than the M3A1 scout car it replaced. In the mountainous terrain of Italy and in the deep <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> of North European winter, the M8 {{was more or less}} restricted to roads, which greatly reduced its value as a reconnaissance vehicle. It was also very vulnerable to landmines. An add-on armor kit was designed to provide an extra quarter-inch of belly armor to reduce landmine vulnerability. Some crews placed sandbags on the floor {{to make up for the}} thin belly armor.|$|R
5000|$|The 10.5 cm leFH 18 (leichte Feldhaubitze [...] "light field {{howitzer}}") was a German light howitzer used in World War II and {{the standard}} artillery piece of the Wehrmacht, adopted for service in 1935 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. A major advance on its predecessor the 10.5 cm leFH 16, the leFH 18 was superior in caliber to its early opponents in the war, with adequate range and firepower, but the modern split trail gun carriage that provided it with more stability and traverse also rendered it too heavy for a mobile role in the largely horse-drawn artillery battalions of the German army, particularly in the <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> of the Eastern Front.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} the most charming country-house YOU CAN IMAGINE: it is QUITE SHUT IN by trees, and so retired that, though only thirty miles from London, the post comes to us but once a week. The roads, it must be confessed, are execrable; it is winter now, and we are up to our knees in <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> But oh, Eliza! how happy we are: with Thomas (he has had a sad attack of rheumatism, dear man!) and little Bobby, and our kind friend Dr. Bates, who comes so far to see us, I leave you to fancy {{that we have a}} charming merry party, and do not care for all the gayeties of Ranelagh.|$|R
50|$|While it {{actually}} has six wheels (eight {{if you count}} the semi-usable spares behind the front axle), it is listed as a 4WD vehicle- the two rear axles are powered, while the front axle is only used for steering. This is different from many US Military combat vehicles which came later, {{most of which were}} all-wheel drive (4x4 or 6x6). Though it had respectable (for the 1930s) performance on paved and improved surfaces, the lack of powered front wheels and its length combined to give it very poor off-road performance, especially in <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> The spare wheels were mounted on free-spinning 'stub axles' {{in an effort to keep}} it from bottoming out the chassis, but they did nothing to help it get unstuck.|$|R
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{concentrates}} on the consumer car and vehicle <b>tyre</b> replacement <b>and</b> premium <b>snow</b> <b>tyre</b> markets; they do not supply automobile manufacturers tyres for new car production. The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared {{to the rest of}} the tyre industry. The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors. It also previously manufactured bicycle tyres but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles tyres to another Finnish company. The Vianor retail tyre store chain, which services cars in addition to selling tyres, is owned by Nokian Tyres PLC.|$|R
