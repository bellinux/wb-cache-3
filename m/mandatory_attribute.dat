Membership in the [...] "person" [...] class would require the entry to contain the [...] "sn" [...] and [...] "cn" [...] attributes, and allow the entry also to contain [...] "userPassword", [...] "telephoneNumber", and other attributes. Since entries may have multiple ObjectClasses values, each entry has a complex of optional and <b>mandatory</b> <b>attribute</b> sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple ObjectClasses values that define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a class definition and an instance in Object-oriented programming, representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is devoted to}} the analysis of the landownership system of palace in Kazan district {{in the second half of}} the 16 th century. The author dwells upon the features of palace village such as the granary or the Orthodox church. The church was <b>mandatory</b> <b>attribute</b> for villages with the local population professing the Orthodox religion. The next passage covers the information on the legal status of the land of the palace in the legislation and the cadasters. Further we can learn the ways of forming land of the palace in the district. The composition of the lands of palace was not permanent. Firstly, the formation of the fund land of the palace administration occurred as a result of seizures of other forms of ownership with the change of their status. Secondly, the peasant land was transferred to the category of palace. Land of the palace administration was actively transferred into the possession of the temporal and monasteries landowners. The next part contains the data on documentation of land ownership in the cadasters. The author reconstructs the composition of palace settlements in the 1560 s and reviews the domains at the end of the 16 th - early 17 th century. In the end, overview of this type of land tenure shows an important role in the integration of multinational region in Moscow State and the economic development of the region.

Determined that in the refinement of the economic nature {{of the risk of}} a number of controversial issues: the definition of the objective or subjective nature of risk; matching of concepts such as «risk», «danger», «loss», «probability of loss»; definition of negative or positive consequences of risk; identification of risk with its consequences, or source of origin, which makes the relevance of research topics. As a result of scientific research has been refined interpretation of risk as an economic category, the characteristics of the company associated with the probability of unforeseen situations that may lead to negative and positive impacts, assessment of which requires the development of alternatives for management decisions. Clarification of the definition focuses on the possibility (probability) of a favorable (unfavorable) events which require certain corrective action management unit of the enterprise. The author emphasizes the mandatory features of the category of «risk», in particular: the concept of risk is always associated with the uncertainty of the future; event occurring has implications for the enterprise (both negative and positive); consequences for necessitates the development of a number of alternative solutions to the possible elimination of the negative consequences of risky events; risk – a <b>mandatory</b> <b>attribute</b> of modern management (its value is enhanced in terms of market conditions); subject to risk assessment and management by the company.

Moreover, his job status is mandatory as well, which is motivated by the way LinkedIn describes itself - as a network for professionals. Note that email, birthday, and gender can usually be hidden from other users, giving the user the ability to alleviate certain threats (e.g., social engineering attacks with the help of personalized emails).

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{security}} mechanisms in a system is to control access to information. Until the early 1970 s, it was not generally realized that two fundamentally different types of access controls exist. Discretionary access control is the most common: users, at their discretion, can specify to the system who can access their files. Under discretionary access controls, a user (or any of the user's programs or processes) can choose to share files with other users. Under nondiscretionary or mandatory access control, users and files have fixed security attributes that are used by the system {{to determine whether a}} user can access a file. The <b>mandatory</b> security <b>attributes</b> are assigned administratively (such as by a person called the security administrator) or automatically by the operating system, according to strict rules. The attributes cannot be modified by users or their programs. If the system determines that a user's <b>mandatory</b> security <b>attributes</b> are inappropriate for access to a certain file, then nobody—not even the owner of the file—will {{be able to make the}} file accessible to that user. 6. 1 ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM Before we worry about access to information within the system, we should pause to consider control of access to the system itself. For some systems, physical controls are entirely adequate, bu...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of some conceptual modelling grammars is the features they provide to allow database designers to show real-world things {{may or may not}} possess a particular attribute or relationship. In the entity-relationship model, for example, the fact that a thing may not possess an attribute can be represented by using a special symbol to indicate that the attribute is optional. Similarly, the fact that a thing {{may or may not be}} involved in a relationship can be represented by showing the minimum cardinality of the relationship as zero. Whether these practices should be followed, however, is a contentious issue. An alternative approach is to eliminate optional attributes and relationships from conceptual schema diagrams by using subtypes that have only <b>mandatory</b> <b>attributes</b> and relationships. In this paper, we first present a theory that led us to predict that optional attributes and relationships should be used in conceptual schema diagrams only when users of the diagrams require a surface-level understanding of the domain being represented by the diagrams. When users require a deep-level understanding, however, optional attributes and relationships should not be used because they undermine users 2 ̆ 7 abilities to grasp important domain semantics. We describe three experiments which we then undertook to test our predictions. The results of the experiments support our predictions...|$|R
40|$|Today {{the museum}} as an {{institution}} serving society is {{recognized as one of}} the largest educational and cultural resources, open to the public and having a huge impact on people. But nowadays the museum is also perceived as the market of cultural values. The activities of the modern museums are increasingly measured by economic criteria: proﬁtability, eﬃciency, number of visitors, the cost of a visit, demand, cultural product, etc. And this happens not only in USA or Western Europe, but throughout the world, including the Republic of Moldova. In order to survive in the society of market economy, museums use marketing strategy, and marketing is increasingly seen as a very useful tool for the successful execution of their duties in the public interest. The purpose of marketing is to attract visitors by ﬁnding the best ways to meet their needs and desires. Since the entrance to most museums is paid, the author of this article examines the marketing function of a museum ticket as a museum product. For analysis several tickets of the museums of the Republic of Moldova, as well as from a number of European countries were taken. The objectives of the museum ticket are the same everywhere: little information for visitors, promotion of the museum, the museum advertising, and so on. Its development is a complex process that must be monitored and evaluated step by step. In fact, the ticket is a document of strict accountability, containing several <b>mandatory</b> <b>attributes</b> such as name, logo of the museum, contact information, and so on. As a result of the analysis, the author concludes that the ticket can do a lot of marketing functions: to promote the museum, to inform visitors, to promote public relations, act as a souvenir. One of the main functions of an entrance ticket is communication...|$|R

According to Sect.  3, there should be as many <bind> elements as there are roles defined by the referred connector. Thus if an editing in the document creates a link to a different connector, it is vital to verify whether the new connector does exist and the <bind> elements are consistent with the roles defined in its scope.

This attribute determines that in the generation of a test code the attributes values in the Angular controllers are <b>mandatory.</b> Once this <b>attribute</b> (and its value) has been removed, the function that writes the code and makes the validation mandatory is no longer necessary for the library and, with that, it was removed.
