A series of novel multi-block copolymers composed of amorphous blocks of poly-(d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and of semi-crystalline poly-(l-lactide) (PLLA) blocks were synthesized. Sunitinib-loaded microspheres were prepared by a single emulsion <b>method</b> <b>using</b> <b>dichloromethane</b> as volatile solvent and DMSO as co-solvent.

Conversely, only 4 % of its counter ion, mesylate, was retained in the microspheres at the same condition (pH 9. 0). Since mesylate is highly water soluble, it is unlikely that it partitions into the organic phase. We demonstrated, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), that imatinib was molecularly dispersed in the polymeric matrix at loadings up to 8. 0 %. At higher drug loading, imatinib partially crystallized in the matrix. Imatinib microspheres released their cargo during three months by a combination of diffusion through the polymer matrix and polymer erosion. In conclusion, we have formulated imatinib microspheres with high LE and LC. Although we started with a double emulsion of imatinib mesylate, the obtained microspheres contained imatinib base which was mainly molecularly dispersed in the polymer matrix.

40|$|Polylactic acid (PLA) is a {{biodegradable}} polymer, {{derived from}} renewable sources, having either a semi-crystalline or amorphous structure. These characteristics make PLA an excellent candidate for food packaging. However, it has many weaknesses such as poor thermal properties, brittle in tensile behaviour, and limited water barrier properties. The introduction of nanoclay {{leads to the}} significant improvement of the mechanical, barrier and thermal properties to the samples provided that the clay platelets are well dispersed in the PLA matrix. In this work, the focus were on the modification of the nanoclay using three types of modifier namely CU, where the nanoclay was modified with Copper (II) Chloride, TEA, where the nanocolay was modified with triethylamine and TEOS, where there nanoclay was modified with Cocamidopropyl Betaine to assist {{the improvement of the}} properties. Upon characterising the modified nanoclay using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), increased of d-spacing of the modified nanoclays up to 39. 9 Å has been seen confirming the success of the modification process. The fabrications of the nanocomposite films were performed by solution mixing <b>method</b> <b>using</b> <b>dichloromethane</b> as solvent creating nanocomposite samples using those three modified nanoclay and unmodified clay namely TEA, CU, TEOS and NA with 1, 2, and 3 wt% nanoclay. The nomenclatures of the samples were given by the name of modified nanoclay followed by the number of percent clay loading. The thermal properties of the films were tested on two areas that are thermal stability and melting temperature using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The results for thermal stability demonstrated both improvement and deterioration of thermal behaviour by knowing the values of the offset temperature. Increase in thermal degradation temperature up to 8. 4 % was demonstrated for TEA 2 and 5. 2 % decreased by CU 1. However, there was no significant change in the melting temperature, which 0. 68 % improvement was obtained in TEA 2 and decrement of 1. 38 % of melting temperature for CU 2 nanocomposite. All nanocomposite samples have shown improvement in water barrier property. Using a modified version of ASTM E 96 /E 96 M- 12 wet cup test, the permeance value of TEA 3 has shown the greatest improvement by exhibiting 44 % less permeance. Universal testing machine has been used to perform the tensile test. In the study of mechanical properties, the most improved tensile stress is NA 1 because 24 % increment in tensile strength has been demonstrated. The most decreased tensile strength belongs to NA 3 with a decrement of 51. 5 %. For the Young’s modulus value, the most increased value was NA 2 that has shown increment of 35 % and the most decreased Young’s modulus value was TEA 1 with a decrement of 46 %.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the flavour and fragrance industry has indicated {{that there is a}} great demand for flavours to have the natural, halaal and kosher status. This has opened the door for the increase in production of flavours by microbial means. Particularly with regards to pyrazine production, bacterial species such as Bacillus are commonly used. Although previous literature indicated that fungi are not as prominent pyrazine producers compared to bacteria, this study has indicated that mycelial fungi can be considered for the production of natural pyrazine flavours. Out of the 280 fungi screened, 45 % showed pyrazine flavour production as indicated in chapter 2. This chapter also showed that the content of growth media can have a substantial influence on flavour production. For example, fungi grown in Cz-medium produced more of the caramel and chocolate flavours, compared to fungi that were grown in TSB, which produced more of the nutty, meaty and potato flavours. The green flavour was, however, prominent in both media, of which mostly members of the Aspergillus and Penicillium groups produced this flavour. Selected Penicillium species, including Penicillium rubrum and P. purpurogenum produced a green pepper odour that is indicative of the presence of methoxypyrazine. Chemical analytical methods as described in chapter 3 confirmed that Penicillium purpurogenum produced 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) and Penicillium rubrum produced both 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) and 2 -methoxy- 3, 5 / 6 -isopropylpyrazine (MIPP). Methoxypyrazines are high impact aroma chemicals that have a typical green pepper odour and a high market value. Due to the favourable characteristics of the Penicillium species in industrial fermentation processes (such as mass spore production and rapid colonization of substrates) and their ability to produce high value compounds, these fungi were selected for further studies. In order to explore the potential use of these fungi in an industrial application, the methoxypyrazines produced were quantified. Prior to quantitation, a solvent extraction <b>method,</b> <b>using</b> <b>dichloromethane,</b> was developed. Amongst the different pH parameters analysed acidified conditions showed the best results, where 69 % MIPP and 97 % MIBP were recovered from the liquid-liquid extraction and 76 % MIPP and 99 % MIBP were recovered from the solid-liquid extraction. Pyrazines quantified from the liquid-liquid extractions indicated that Penicillium rubrum produced 0. 38 μg MIPP. L- 1 and 0. 88 μg MIBP. L- 1, and Penicillium purpurogenum produced 0. 88 μg MIPP. L- 1 and 2. 15 μg MIBP. L- 1 (Chapter 4). Yields obtained from this study were not seen as feasible for the production of methoxypyrazines by the fungi on an industrial scale and, therefore, solid state fermentation was investigated as an option to improve the yields. Due to the availability of soy press cake as a by-product, as well as the variety of the amino acids present, it was selected as a possible substrate for pyrazine production. The results from this study, however, indicated that the nature of the substrate, such as the lipid content, fungal content and particle size of the soy press cake does not support fungal growth and makes pyrazine analyses problematic. Alternate methods of improving methoxypyrazine yields thus need to be found. A limiting factor is the lack of understanding of the metabolic pathway involved in pyrazine production by Penicillium species. By having this knowledge the fermentation process can be adapted accordingly for the optimal production of methoxypyrazines by these microorganisms. Additionally, substrates that contain the necessary precursors that are cost effective would contribute significantly in the development of an economically viable fermentation process for the production of methoxypyrazines by Penicillium species.

40|$|Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a protein-bound typical uremic toxin that accumulates in {{patients}} with impaired kidney function. The laboratory <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> to quantify serum concentrations of IS require improvement. We report an optimal, cost-effective alternative to the <b>methods</b> currently <b>used.</b> The <b>methods</b> is as follows: serum samples were extracted and deproteinized using acetonitrile and then further purified <b>using</b> <b>dichloromethane.</b> The samples were then analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector at a flow rate of 1. 0  mL/min. The isocratic mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile− 0. 2 % (V/V) trifluoroacetic acid in phosphate buffered saline, pH 2. 5 (8 : 92, V/V). Detector settings were λex 280  nm/λem 390  nm. Under the indicated conditions, IS was well separated. The retention time was approximately 6. 59 ± 0. 11  min. The results of the precision and reproducibility tests were < 3 %, and the recovery rate was greater than 95 %,(98. 44 ± 3. 21 %). In conclusion, HPLC with a fluorescence detector is a simple, sensitive, and reliable method for quantifying IS concentration in the serum of patients with chronic renal failure...|$|R
