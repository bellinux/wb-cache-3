40|$|National audienceThe "academic" {{method of}} {{manufacturing}} dimensions determination through the decomposition of the manufacturing plan into several steps, each one corresponding to a part holder, is not usable when the part is produced by only one machine, like {{in the case of}} screw machining. The transfer of the condition dimensions in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the setup operator might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine. This results in introducing intermediate control steps into the manufacturing plan. In this case and for some condition dimensions, several chains of dimensions are possible, thus several <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimension</b> systems are possible...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{machining}} workshops, workpieces {{are produced}} according to <b>dimensions</b> known as <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> For the same workpiece {{and the same}} manufacturing plan, several sets of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> can be used but none satisfy simultaneously the two main missions workshops need to fulfil: (a) Ensuring conformity of products to their design dimension tolerances (also called blueprint tolerances) and (b) steering machines in order to compensate for tool wear. The set of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> obtained from the design dimensions using the minimal chain of dimensions method is optimal for a conformity check of workpieces but is practically unusable for steering machines because {{of the complexity of}} its relationships toward the tool correctors and tools dimensions. The pilot dimensions method consists in, on the one hand, identifying and representing these tool correctors and these tool/program dimensions on the production drawings (besides the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions)</b> and, on other the other hand, determining their correction values through a mathematical set of relations after having measured the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> on a workpiece.

This module permits the verification of the manufacturing pre-projects and the optimization of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The module used an optimization procedure which was realized through an equal distribution of the excess tolerance which {{is that of the}} design functional requirement. However in reality, this distribution should take into account the stochastic aspects of the dispersions and the complexity or cost of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> In the present work, in order to overcome these drawbacks, a statistical and cost based tolerance synthesis model has been developed. It is shown that this model performs an objective and global distribution of the residual (excess) tolerances of the design functional dimensions on all the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the process plan. The dispersions method is used in the modelling process to determine the variables of the objective function and to automatically extract the manufacturing tolerance chains. These chains are then used to construct the functional constraints of the optimization model.

40|$|International audienceToday, for {{designing}} {{a new product}} in an industrial context, designers use CAD models. Since {{it is impossible to}} manufacture a part to its exact dimensions, some variations of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> are allowed. To this end, designers specify tolerances. Manufacturing engineers are then faced with the problem of selecting appropriate process plan (machining processes and production equipment) to ensure that design tolerances are satisfied. Developing a suitable process plan for release to production is a complicated and time consuming process. The purpose of tolerance analysis is to verify whether the design tolerance requirements can be met when a process plan is given with specified manufacturing errors. In this paper, the model of manufactured part (MMP) is proposed for modeling the error propagation in a multi-operational machining process. The MPP is then used for tolerance analysis. The tolerance analysis is done by worst case researching. The worst case researching is expressed as a multi layer optimization problem. This paper aims to propose a solution technique to this optimization problem and compares performance of different current optimization algorithms for solving the worst case researching...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} of this work {{which is based on}} the approach of simultaneous engineering is to {{contribute to the development of}} a CIM tool for the synthesis of functional design dimensions expressed by average values and tolerance intervals. In this paper, the dispersions method known as the Δl method which proved reliable in the simulation of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> is used to develop a methodology for the automation of the simulation. This methodology is constructed around three procedures. The first procedure executes the verification of the functional requirements by automatically extracting the functional dimension chains in the mechanical sub-assembly.

The third procedure uses the optimized values of the dispersions to compute the optimized average values and tolerances of the functional dimensions in the chains. A statistical and cost based approach is integrated in the methodology in order to take account of the capabilities of the manufacturing processes and to distribute optimal values among the individual components of the chains.

40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{tolerancing}} {{is intended}} to determine the intermediate geometrical and dimensional states of the part during its manufacturing process. These <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions</b> also serve to satisfy not only the functional requirements given in the definition drawing, but also the manufacturing constraints, for example geometrical defects of the machine, vibration and the wear of the cutting tool. In this paper, an experimental study {{on the influence of}} the wear of the cutting tool (systematic dispersions) is explored. This study was carried out on three stages. The first stage allows machining without elimination of dispersions (random, systematic) so the tolerances of manufacture according to total dispersions. In the second stage, the results of the first stage are filtered in such way to obtain the tolerances according to random dispersions. Finally, from the two previous stages, the systematic dispersions are generated. The objective {{of this study is to}} model by the least squares method the error of manufacture based on systematic dispersion. Finally, an approach of optimization of the manufacturing tolerances was developed for machining on a CNC machine tool.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test whether {{complexity}} interacts with Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) practices by positively moderating the impact of S&OP practices on <b>manufacturing</b> operational performance <b>dimensions</b> of quality, flexibility and delivery.

Scales are validated with structural equation modelling. The hypotheses are tested through a hierarchical regression analysis using data from a sample of 725 manufacturing plants from 21 countries. Findings – S&OP practices of organizational management, technological integration, measurement systems and integration of plans impact positively on <b>manufacturing</b> operational <b>dimensions</b> of quality, delivery and flexibility. Process complexity moderates the effect of S&OP practices, amplifying its impact upon all three performance dimensions. Product complexity moderates the effect on quality, but not on delivery and flexibility. Practical implications – S&OP practices of organizational and technological coordination of manufacturing and new product design; information technology to measure information sharing and planning; dedicated information systems do impact upon manufacturing operational performance. Results are amplified by process complexity. The more complex are the manufacturing processes the larger the gains of S&OP.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve the railcar/rail truck interface by developing a low maintenance bearing interface with a favorable friction coefficient. Friction and wear at the center bowl/center plate bearing interface cause high turning moments around curved track, wear of truck components, and increased detrimental dynamic effects. The recommended improvement of the rail truck interface is a set of two steel inserts, one concave and one convex, that can be retrofit to center bowls/center plates. The insert geometry addresses concerns about maintaining favorable pressure distribution on existing components, minimizing overall height increase to accommodate existing infrastructure, and retaining railcar stability. The stability of the railcar upon the design inserts has been ensured when the instantaneous center of rotation of the railcar body is above the railcar center of gravity. The damping ratio provided by the frictional moment within center bowl is 240 and eliminates the possibility of dynamic amplification. Using a 90 inch radius of curvature ensures stability and requires a 0. 5 inch diameter reduction of the existing center plate for a gap of 1 / 16 inch. The increase in railcar height for the specific design is 0. 71 inches which can be absorbed by either grinding of the center plate or new <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The design is feasible for small travel values corresponding to small vertical gaps at the side bearings. In addition to geometry alterations, the bearing surfaces are coated with a protective metallic layer. The literature suggests that optimum friction coefficients between bearing elements in the center bowl/center plate interface may reduce turning moments of the truck, wear of truck components, and detrimental dynamic effects such as hunting.

Typically, each application requires a different type of heat exchanger such as, tube, shell, with/without phase change, mixing/non mixing etc. heat exchangers. Due to their importance, there has been an ongoing interest in reducing the perational/constructional costs and increasing the efficiency. A lot of research has be done in optimizing certain features of heat exchangers (e. g. tube dimensions, fin thickness etc.), but so far none of them investigates the optimization of the whole topology of a heat exchanger. The aim of this thesis is to optimize the structure of a two flow heat exchanger, by means of topology optimization. More specifically we aim to maximize the efficiency of heat transfer, given some predefined pressure drop and dimension constraints. These constraints are necessitated by the need of achieving a reduced operating (pressure drop) and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>dimensions)</b> costs. A heat exchanger, being a multi-physics system, can be described by two physical phenomena: the flow of the fluid and the heat transfer. In this study we focus on heat exchanger governed by an isothermal and incompressible Stokes flow with low Reynolds number, while the heat transfer is assumed to be advective-conductive heat transfer, without internal heat generation, characterised by a relatively high Peclet number. We evaluate two novel models for topology optimization of heat exchangers; the Fluid Tracking Model and the Multi-Material Model. Throughout the experimental evaluation we saw that the Multi-Material Model performs best. The Fluid Tracking Model did not produce optimal results and was unable to enforce non-mixing designs. The Multi-Material Model optimized designs that maximized the heat transfer surface area between the fluids. Furthermore the designs illustrated a wall at the interfaces of the two fluids, keeping the two flows separated. Both 2 D and 3 D cases were studied. The 3 D optimal results achieved a moderate improvement in performance over a simple design of a concentric tube heat exchanger.
