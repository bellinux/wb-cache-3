5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such <b>mixers,</b> five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

50|$|A 25-year-old male {{worker at}} a {{concrete}} pipe manufacturing facility died from injurieshe received while cleaning a ribbon-type concrete <b>mixer.</b> The victim’s daily tasks included cleaning out the concrete <b>mixer</b> {{at the end}} of the shift.

No one witnessed the event, but investigators concluded that the <b>mixer</b> operator had shut off the main breaker and then made a telephone call instead of following the normal procedure for checking the <b>mixer</b> before any one entered it.

5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete <b>mixers</b> and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

During the production, 20 layers of lightning CGI effects were applied to depict Electro. Jamie Foxx was photographed as Electro by KNB EFX team and the skin colors used to show the moods of the character. A total number of 1600 visual effects shots of the film was originally filmed in 2K resolution and then converted into 4K resolution with the help of color grading. To give the visual effects a realistic look, sound designers Addison Teague and Eric Norris and re-recording <b>mixers</b> Paul Massey and David Giammarco mixed the background music using Auro 11.1 cinema sound technology and the film's soundtrack was remixed using Dolby Atmos, Auro and Dolby 5.1.|$|E

25|$|DJ <b>mixers</b> {{are small}} audio mixing {{consoles}} specialized for DJing. Most DJ <b>mixers</b> have far fewer channels than a mixer {{used by a}} record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound <b>mixers</b> in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio <b>mixers</b> have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ <b>mixers</b> may have only two channels. While DJ <b>mixers</b> have {{many of the same}} features found on larger <b>mixers</b> (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc), DJ <b>mixers</b> have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.|$|E
40|$|We define as {{an optimal}} <b>mixer</b> a mixing device {{able to deliver}} a uniformly optimal mixing {{performance}} {{over a wide range}} of operating and initial conditions. We consider the conceptual problem of designing an optimal <b>mixer</b> starting from a well-known reference <b>mixer,</b> the sine flow. We characterize the mixing performance of the reference <b>mixer,</b> and show that it performs poorly and erratically over a wide range of operating conditions and is quite sensitive to the geometry of the initial concentration field. We define as a target performance the best mixing performance the reference <b>mixer</b> is able to achieve. In steps we modify the design of the reference <b>mixer.</b> First, we optimize the time sequence of the switching protocols and show that the mixing performance of the time-optimized <b>mixer,</b> although substantially improved with respect to the reference <b>mixer,</b> is still far from achieving the target performance and being insensitive to the geometry of the initial concentration field. The analysis of the performance of the time-optimized <b>mixer</b> brings to light the deficiency of the actuating system used, which delivers always the same amount of shear at the same locations. We modify the actuating system by allowing the stirring velocity fields to shift along their coordinate axes. A new <b>mixer,</b> the space-optimized <b>mixer,</b> is created by equipping the reference <b>mixer</b> with the new actuating system and optimizing the shift of the stirring velocity field at each iteration. The space-optimized <b>mixer</b> is able to deliver the target performance over the upper two-thirds of the operating range. In the lower one-third, the performance of the space-optimized <b>mixer</b> deteriorates because of the use of a periodic protocol. A optimal <b>mixer</b> is finally obtained using the actuating system of the space-optimized <b>mixer</b> and coupling the time and shift optimizations. The resulting optimal <b>mixer</b> is able to deliver a uniform target performance, insensitive to the geometry of the initial conditions, over the entire operating range...|$|R
