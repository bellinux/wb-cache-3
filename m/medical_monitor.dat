40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>monitoring</b> claims seek money {{damages for}} the costs of medical testing {{required}} after toxic exposure.

This Note argues that while a present physical injury should be required, a plaintiff that demonstrates subcellular changes indicating toxic exposure and an increased risk of developing a disease sufficiently satisfies the present physical injury requirement.

40|$|Abstract—During Urban Search and Rescue (USaR) {{operations}} in collapsed buildings, once the entrapped victims are located the extrication starts. The latter is always time consuming whilst {{in most cases}} <b>medical</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{and support of the}} victim is needed. Monitoring vital signs of victim is quite important but due to the particular post-collapse conditions of the building (fires, gas leaks, tremors/instability), the preferred method would be remote <b>medical</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In this work a commercial off-the-shelf system for victim’s vital signs wireless transmission is tested as part of a feasibility study in which non-invasive methods such as breath or sweat analysis can be used for <b>medical</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The capabilities and the limitations of the tested technology are presented and discussed.

50|$|Two {{separate}} {{medical surveillance}} programs, for former workers and community residents, have been funded by settlements of class action litigation against National Lead of Ohio, a contractor for the Department of Energy. These Fernald Settlement Funds are administered by a US Federal Court, which maintains {{oversight of the}} Fernald <b>Medical</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Programs. The Fernald (Residents) <b>Medical</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Program (FMMP) is a voluntary ongoing medical surveillance program for community residents living within five miles of {{the perimeter of the}} Fernald site, and the Fernald Workers <b>Medical</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Program (FWMMP) is a program for former workers who were employed when National Lead of Ohio was the contractor. Activities of the <b>medical</b> <b>monitoring</b> programs include both periodic medical examinations and diagnostic testing and yearly questionnaire data collection. In January 2007, there were 9,764 persons enrolled in the FMMP and 2716 former workers enrolled in the FWMMP. The FMMP has an extensive computer database available for research studies. Samples of whole blood, serum, plasma and urine were obtained from all FMMP participants {{at the time of the}} initial examination, and over 100,000 one-ml aliquots of these biospecimens have been stored at −80 °C since then.|$|R
50|$|Thirty hours {{prior to}} the eclipse, the {{transference}} dome is complete. An instrument package is prepared for a trial run; its systems will simulate human vital signs during the teleport. These will be read by a <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> (as worn on the wrist of every Alphan) re-tooled to transmit via neutrino carrier wave.

50|$|Electronic {{activity}} trackers {{are fundamentally}} upgraded versions of pedometers; {{in addition to}} counting steps, they use accelerometers and altimeters to calculate mileage, graph overall physical activity, calculate calorie expenditure, {{and in some cases}} also monitor and graph heart rate and quality of sleep. Some also include a silent alarm. Some newer models approach the US definition of a Class II <b>medical</b> <b>monitor,</b> and some manufacturers hope to eventually make them capable of alerting to a medical problem, although FDA approval would be required. Early versions such as the original Fitbit (2009), were worn clipped to the waist; formats have since diversified to include wristbands and armbands (smart bands) and smaller devices that can be clipped wherever preferred. Apple and Nike together developed the Nike+iPod, a sensor-equipped shoe that worked with an iPod Nano.|$|E

40|$|AbstractModern <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> systems {{shoulder}} {{the responsibility of}} patients’ surveillance. Such life-critical systems steering by software will put patient’s life in peril if they try in vain to satisfy patient’s requirements.

40|$|With soaring of the sub-health {{population}} {{around the}} world, the traditional medical treatment has not met the increasing demand; it is urgent {{to create a}} modern nursing technology to provide service for human being.

On the basis of development of the intra-body communication technology, a wireless, wound-free, portable medical system with real-time monitoring is proposed in this paper. In combination with the remote diagnosis system in the modern medical treatment, the sensor technology and the intra-body communication technology can be utilized to provide all-sided and real-time monitoring for individuals.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} diagnostic performance of a storage phosphor plate system Digora® Optime (Soredex, Helsinki, Finland) with two types of LCD monitor in the detection of artificial caries when compared to Ultraspeed (D), Ektaspeed Plus (E), and Insight (F) radiographic films. Seventy extracted human molars—with artificial caries—were radiographed under identical standardized conditions using (1) a storage phosphor plate system Digora (Soredex, Helsinki, Finland), (2) Insight, (3) Ektaspeed Plus, and (4) Ultraspeed (Carestream Health Inc, Rochester, NY). All digital images and radiographs were examined by three observers for the presence or absence of artificial caries using a five-point confidence scale. Digital images were evaluated both on a LCD computer monitor (Philips 170 S, Holland) and medical monitor— 3  megapixel monochrome display (Me 355 i 2, Totoku, Tokyo) —with brightness and contrast enhancement. Observer responses were evaluated using ROC analysis and other measurements for diagnostic accuracy. Storage phosphor images with <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> demonstrated higher mean Az values (0. 70 [*]±[*] 0. 08) than digital images with computer monitor and conventional films. Storage phosphor images with <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> presented the highest score, 0. 97, 0. 90, 0. 94, for each observer, respectively. Also, true positive observations (0. 82) and positive likelihood ratios (2. 71) were higher in enhanced storage phosphor images with <b>medical</b> <b>monitor.</b> Caries detection of mechanically created lesions by experienced radiologists is roughly comparable when examining D-speed film images and Digora images on both the computer and medical LCD monitors, and appears to be poorer on E- and F-speed film images...|$|E
40|$|Hypobaric {{decompression}} sickness (DCS) research presents the <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> with the {{difficult task of}} assessing the onset and progression of DCS largely on the basis of subjective symptoms. Even with the introduction of precordial Doppler ultrasound techniques for the detection of venous gas emboli (VGE), correct prediction of DCS can be made only about 65 percent of the time according to data from the Armstrong Laboratory's (AL's) hypobaric DCS database. An AL research protocol concerned with exercise and its effects on denitrogenation efficiency includes implementation of a performance assessment test battery to evaluate cognitive functioning during a 4 -h simulated 30, 000 ft (9144 m) exposure. Information gained from such a test battery may assist the <b>medical</b> <b>monitor</b> in identifying early signs of DCS and subtle neurologic dysfunction related to cases of asymptomatic, but advanced, DCS. This presentation concerns the selection and integration of a test battery and the timely graphic display of subject test results for the principal investigator and <b>medical</b> <b>monitor.</b> A subset of the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) developed through the Office of Military Performance Assessment Technology (OMPAT) was selected. The ANAM software provides a library of simple tests designed for precise measurement of processing efficiency in a variety of cognitive domains. For our application and time constraints, two tests requiring high levels of cognitive processing and memory were chosen along with one test requiring fine psychomotor performance. Accuracy, speed, and processing throughout variables as well as RMS error were collected. An automated mood survey provided 'state' information on six scales including anger, happiness, fear, depression, activity, and fatigue. An integrated and interactive LOTUS 1 - 2 - 3 macro was developed to import and display past and present task performance and mood-change information...|$|E
