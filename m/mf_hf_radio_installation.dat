40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported on a}} significant new multi-national project to provide improved predictions and forecasts of <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> propagation for commercial aircraft operating on trans-polar routes. In these regions, there are limited or no VHF air-traffic control facilities and geostationary satellites are below the horizon. Therefore <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> remains important in maintaining communications with the aircraft at all times. Space weather disturbances can {{have a range of}} effects on the ionosphere and hence <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> propagation - particularly in the polar cap. While severe space weather effects can lead to a total loss of communications (i. e. radio blackout), less intense events can still cause significant disruption. In this paper we will present the effect of a series of M and X class solar flares and a relatively weak CME on <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> performance from 6 to 13 January 2014. This is an interesting interval {{from the point of view}} of <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> propagation because while the solar effects on the ionosphere are significant, except for an interval of approximately 12 hours duration, they are not so intense as to produce a complete radio blackout on all paths. Observations of the signal-to-noise ratio, direction of arrival, and time of flight of <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> signals on six paths (one entirely within the polar cap, three trans-auroral, and two sub-auroral) will be presented together with riometer measurements of the ionospheric absorption. Global maps of D-region absorption (D-region absorption prediction, DRAP) inferred from satellite measurements of the solar wind parameters will be compared with the HF and riometer observations. In addition, a ray-tracing model using a realistic background ionosphere and including localised features found in the ionospheric polar cap (e. g. polar patches and arcs) will be used to model the expected and observed <b>HF</b> <b>radio</b> propagation characteristics.

We are particularly interested in structures at scales less than one radar pulse length, and smaller than the beam width, and especially the degree of anisotropy of turbulence at these scales. Previous radar observations are especially important {{in regard to the}} degree of anisotropy, and we highlight the role that these studies have had in furthering our understanding in this area. The contrasts and similarities between the models of anisotropic turbulence and specular reflection are considered. The need for more intense studies of anisotropy at <b>MF,</b> <b>HF</b> and VHF is especially highlighted, since this is an area in which these radars can make important contributions to the understanding of atmospheric turbulence...|$|R
