5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys are infected by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou virus) also infects humans. Two, <b>maybe</b> <b>three,</b> species have gone extinct {{over the last two}} centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E
25|$|Hakor's {{accession}} {{and relationships}} with his predecessor Nepherites I were long debated. After Nepherites' death a dynastic struggle {{did seem to}} have occurred, and the throne was claimed by two or <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> pretenders: Hakor, Psammuthes, and possibly a phantom figure called Muthis who was only mentioned in Eusebius' Epithome of Manetho. As a result, Hakor was alternately considered Nepherites' legitimate successor or an unrelated usurper.|$|E

25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E
500|$|Six {{weeks after}} the birth, Rowe saw her son {{for the first time}} since his arrival into the world. She had met with Jackson to pose for {{photographs}} with their newborn son at a hotel. Upon arriving, Rowe was ushered into the hotel room, where she was given the infant to hold and told to smile for the camera with Michael. Afterward, she was sent on her way. Rowe did not want to become too attached to Prince, as she felt it would make her situation harder to deal with. At Neverland, Prince was cared for by a team of six nannies and six nurses during his first few months. According to one nanny who worked at the Californian ranch, Prince Michael's mother was not a significant presence in the child's early life. [...] "I saw her <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> times and she seemed very sullen." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Baelor" [...] {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of the German actress Sibel Kekilli, {{in the role of}} the prostitute Shae. Executive producer George R. R. Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} pop album to be {{mastered}} without the momentary gaps that are typically placed between tracks {{as a point of}} demarcation. It made use of two crossfades that blended songs together, giving the impression of a continuous live performance. Although both stereo and monaural mixes of the album were prepared, the Beatles were minimally involved in what they regarded as the less important stereo mix sessions, leaving the task to Martin and Emerick. Emerick recalls: [...] "We spent three weeks on the mono mixes and <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> days on the stereo." [...] He estimates that they spent 700 hours on the LP, more than 30 times that of the first Beatles album, Please Please Me, which cost £400 to produce. The final cost of Sgt. Pepper was approximately £25,000. The album was completed on 21 April 1967 with the recording of random noises and voices that were included on the run-out groove along with a high-pitched tone, inaudible to human ears, that could be heard by dogs.|$|E
500|$|The MPAA {{questioned}} elements including Smith's character {{drinking in}} front of a 7-year-old and the character flying under the influence of alcohol. Scenes that were removed to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA included a scene of statutory rape, two of three uses of the word [...] "fuck" [...] (the MPAA only permitted one use for the PG-13 rating), and intense shots of needles going into arms. The MPAA allowed scenes of Hancock shoving a prisoner's head up another's behind and of Hancock having explosive ejaculation during sexual intercourse, though Berg chose to save the latter scene for the DVD, explaining, [...] "It just wasn't that funny. Never was. You'd put it {{in front of}} an audience and there'd be two, <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> people laughing. There was no way to do that and then regain even a modicum of emotional integrity." [...] The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: [...] "At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard." [...] With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with Hancock when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, [...] "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film." [...] The MPAA ultimately gave the film a PG-13 rating, citing [...] "some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language".|$|E

2500|$|The {{seeds are}} sown from mid-April to mid-May with grain drills to 4–6cm sowing depth. Hemp needs less {{fertilizer}} than corn does. A total of 60–150kg of nitrogen, 40–140kg phosphorus (P2O5) and 75–200kg of potassium [...] per acre for hemp fiber made before sowing and again later, <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> to four weeks. When practiced, especially in France double use of fiber and seed fertilization with nitrogen doses up to 100kg / ha rather low. Organic fertilizers such as manure can utilize industrial hemp well. Neither weeds nor crop protection measures are necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Cobb {{decided to}} use an {{abbreviated}} course of training. [...] "We weren't {{going to do it}} by traditional ways where they had to come for 20 hours (of training). [...] So they had to do it at one sitting—how long will people participate?—well, <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> hours and that's pretty much the way it was." [...] Cobb cautiously did not state {{how long it would take}} to train 100,000 people. He had no idea. In fact it took only a few years and by the 20th anniversary of the citizen training program over half a million people in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs had received training in CPR.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Lester Bangs gave a lukewarm assessment and called Wavelength [...] "a very nice record. I'm {{sure all the}} people at Warner Bros. are pleased with it. Ditto the DJs... Still, though, it do confound how such a monumental talent can mire himself in such twaddle, fine as some of it may be." [...] Melody Maker reviewed the album as evidence of Morrison's [...] "drift into the American Dream." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{referred to it as}} a good but not great album and called attention to side two, which he felt was [...] "an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming." [...] Time magazine was more enthusiastic: [...] "Morrison has made two, <b>maybe</b> <b>three</b> albums that rank high among the finest of all rock 'n' roll. Wavelength is good enough to stand close by Morrison's best work, a record of sinuous, sensuous magic. The man just can't be beat." ...|$|E
