40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} the {{dissertation}} is to survey the major attitudes within the Occidental Protestant Churches towards Christian missionary work. This embraces, firstly, an historical account of the earliest evidences of missionary interest within Protestantism and the various reactions to it by Church leaders. Secondly, the study involves the growth of missionary enthusiasm among church members and the consequent development of missionary attitudes {{within the context of}} the three-way relationship of the Occidental Protestant Churches to each other, to the younger Churches of the Orient and to non-Christian Oriental religious faiths. Although much historical data is presented, this dissertation does not aim to be a history of Protestant <b>missions</b> to the <b>Orient.</b> 	<b>Research</b> into this wide subject has proceeded within definite limits, which are explained in the introductory chapter. Throughout the study attention has been focussed on the Orient, although the discussion in the early chapters has not been restricted to this area. The time-period, covered by the survey, stretches from the Protestant Reformation to the outbreak of the First World War [TRUNCATED]...|$|R

The report is intended to provide staff of Congressional committees, other executive departments, and other DOE offices with substantive program information so as to facilitate governmental overview and coordination of Federal research programs. Of equal importance, its availability facilitates communication of program information to interested research engineers and scientists. Each BES Division administers basic, <b>mission</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> programs in the area indicated by its title. The BES Engineering Research Program is one such program; it is administered by the Engineering and Geosciences Division of BES. In preparing this report the principal investigators were asked to submit summaries for their projects that were specifically applicable to fiscal year 1996. The summaries received have been edited if necessary, but the press for timely publication made it impractical to have the investigators review and approve the revised summaries prior to publication. For more information about a given project, it is suggested that the investigators be contacted directly...|$|E

The goal of the research is to identify and solve real world problems that interfere with {{the development of}} alternative cash crops like chocolate (cacao) and coffee in lieu of narcotic crop production. The ARS program is divided into several parts that encompass a molecular genomics research effort for the enhancement of plant germplasm, as well as a plant disease program, which focuses on procedures for overcoming pest and disease problems in these cash crops. More than $ 4, 000, 000 of permanent federal funding has been diverted into this effort to support scientists at several locations both in the United States and in producing countries. State of the art molecular tools and procedures are being employed to identify and map the genetic basis of plant disease resistance in cacao. These include DNA fingerprinting of the available cacao germplasm collections in producing countries and detailed studies on gene expression. Innovative biocontrol efforts are also underway to reduce disease pressure on these cash crops using inexpensive technologies that pose no threat to other agricultural systems. Collaborative agreements between the USDA and research organization within producing countries are key to the successful incorporation of these technologies...|$|E

40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Policy Actors and RelationshipsIncreasingly, research is funded through mission oriented programs. As a consequence, two types of dynamics are interacting: 1) the global cognitive dynamics of academic knowledge production and 2) the local dynamics of research policies, creating the conditions in which knowledge production takes place. The paper answers the following questions: How is the development of research fields shaped by these local policies? What types of multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary cognitive structures develop, and do these address the articulated knowledge needs? What is the position of local researchers in the global research field, and how does this change over time? Do these local policies result in the formation of transdisciplinary collaboration between researchers and practitioners, addressing the problems formulated by local stakeholders? We study two cases which are both multidisciplinary academic fields as well as examples of policy oriented knowledge production: coastal studies and river studies in the Netherlands. The question this paper tries to answer is how <b>mission</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> funding influences the dynamics of knowledge production, and why. Methods and data The paper is organized as follows; - Firstly we analyze the policies formulated to shape river studies and coastal studies. What are the challenges for both fields as formulated in the core policy documents? How have these policies changed over time? [1] - Secondly, we will analyze the developments of both field, using bibliometric approaches [2]. What are the research fronts, and what is the position of Dutch researchers in the two fields? Do these research fronts show the influence of research policies? Do we witness multidisciplinary structures emerging that relate to the societal priorities and research policies? - Finally, do we find traces of productive transdisciplinary interactions [1] between research and practice, in terms of papers co-authored by researchers and practitioners? Findings The cases show strong similarities, but also interesting differences. [1] [4] The cases are remarkably similar in terms of their relation to basic research, in terms of the involved research fields, in terms of the organizational configurations, {{and in terms of the}} selected science policy instruments. Both fields are supported in the Netherlands with similar large scale programs of agenda setting and funding. And, societal problems are similar in the two cases. In both cases, also strong societal knowledge needs exist, related to safety issues, climate change, ecological preservation, and the economic role of the coastal and river areas. Additionally, in both cases the way the problems are articulated, changes over time. For example, in the defence against flooding, new policies have emerged that put much more emphasis on ecological sustainable solutions. This in turn influences demand for knowledge considerably. We show to which extent the research system takes up the societal questions. Does research activity increases in the relevant topics? Both in coastal studies as in river studies, science policy did influence the research done. For example, new directions in research can be discerned, such as research on soft coastal engineering and research on integral coastal zone management. Also the intensity of transdisciplinary collaboration has increased over time. More specifically, we will show which stakeholders are becoming increasingly active in research collaboration. However, despite the similarities, the analysis shows also considerable differences between coastal studies and river studies in terms of the emerging cognitive structures and the structure and intensity of local collaborations. The paper will conclude with an explanation of these differences, based on differences in cognitive identity [3] of the two fields under study.

40|$|For {{conducting}} practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> different research {{strategies are}} available. In this paper a typology is developed for differentiating between practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> {{strategies that are}} data based and participatory research strategies. The former category involves quantitative and qualitative data based research strategies. The latter category, participatory research strategies, includes knowledge based research and practice based research. At present, methodological criteria for assessing the quality of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> heavily rely on those developed for theory <b>oriented</b> <b>research,</b> in particular internal and external validity and reliability. However, we argue that for assessing the results of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> other criteria are necessary. In this paper, methodological criteria are formulated for evaluating the internal validity and practical utility of practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research</b> {{with the help of}} a Delphi study using research methodologists as experts. They agree upon the criteria of verifiability, comprehensibility and acceptance of the results, as well as holism. Moreover, different categories of participatory and data based research strategies are compared to these criteria. Practice based research and qualitative data based research are best equipped to fulfill these criteria. These findings may enable researchers to make a more deliberate choice for a specific research strategy in practice <b>oriented</b> <b>research...</b>|$|R
