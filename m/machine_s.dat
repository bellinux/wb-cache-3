40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to unsuper-vised change detection in multispectral remote-sensing images. The proposed approach aims at extracting the change informa-tion by jointly analyzing the spectral channels of multitemporal images in the original feature space without any training data. This is accomplished by using a selective Bayesian threshold-ing for deriving a pseudotraining set that is necessary for ini-tializing an adequately defined binary semisupervised support vector <b>machine</b> (<b>S</b> 3 VM) classifier. Starting from these initial seeds, the S 3 VM performs change detection in the original mul-titemporal feature space by gradually considering unlabeled pat-terns {{in the definition of}} the decision boundary between changed and unchanged pixels according to a semisupervised learning algorithm. This algorithm models the full complexity of the change-detection problem, which is only partially represented from the seed pixels included in the pseudotraining set. The values of the classifier parameters are then defined according to a novel unsupervised model-selection technique based on a similarity measure between change-detection maps obtained with different settings. Experimental results obtained on different multispectral remote-sensing images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|Abstract: The {{starting}} point of this work is the basic question of whether there exists a formal and meaningful way to limit the computational power that a time bounded randomized Turing Machine can employ on its randomness. We attack this question using a fascinating connection between space and time bounded machines given by Cook [4]: a Turing <b>Machine</b> <b>S</b> running in space s with access to an unbounded stack is equivalent to a Turing Machine T running in time 2 O(s). We extend S with access to a read-only tape containing 2 O(s) uniform random bits, and a usual error regime: one-sided or two-sided, and bounded or unbounded. We study the effect of placing a bound p {{on the number of}} passes S is allowed on its random tape. It follows from Cook’s results that: • If p = 1 (one-way access) and the error is one-sided unbounded, S is equivalent to deterministic T. • If p = ∞ (unrestricted access), S is equivalent to randomized T (with the same error). As our first two contributions, we completely resolve the case of unbounded error. We show that we cannot meaningfully interpolate between deterministic and randomized T by increasing p: • If p = 1 and the error is two-sided unbounded, S is still equivalent to deterministic T. • If p = 2 and the error is unbounded, S is already equivalent to randomized T (with the same error). In the bounded error case, we consider a logarithmic space Stack <b>Machine</b> <b>S</b> that is allowed p passes over it...|$|E

Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions with less computation time than existing approaches. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} is {{described}} a software infrastructure to enable users to design hard real-time systems from Ptolemy II [1]. The Giotto [2] domain within the Ptolemy II design environment is made use of to model systems which are then compiled and executed on KURT-Linux [3], a real time flavor of Linux. The first stage of the software takes a graphical model as an input to generate intermediate code in the C language. This intermediate code consists of the task-code to be executed, {{as well as a}} representation of their timing requirements. The second stage, called the Embedded Machine [5] reads in the timing information and interprets it to release the tasks for execution as per the stated requirements. The released tasks can either be assigned to a standard scheduler such as EDF, or to a scheduling interpreter called the Scheduling <b>machine,</b> or <b>S</b> <b>Machine.</b> The <b>S</b> <b>Machine</b> was developed to gain fine grained control over the scheduling of tasks. The <b>S</b> <b>Machine</b> requires as input scheduling information that specifies a time line for the tasks involved thus giving the designer maximum flexibility over task scheduling, and consequently greater resource utilization. The E&S Machines when compiled along with the generated task and timing code for the KURT-Linux platform forms an executable that delivers predictable real-time performance. The benefit this approach offers is that the real-time tasks can run along with ordinary Linux tasks without the timing properties of the real-time tasks being affected. An audio application was designed to illustrate the effectiveness of this tool-flow, which achieved a timing uncertainty of less than ± 30 microseconds in its task execution times...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 3 How {{to utilize}} data more {{sufficiently}} {{is a crucial}} consider-ation in machine learning. Semi-supervised learning uses both unlabeled data and labeled data for this reason. However, Semi-Supervised Sup-port Vector <b>Machine</b> (<b>S</b> 3 VM) focuses on maximizing margin only, and it abandons the instances which are not support vectors. This fact moti-vates us to modify maximum margin criterion to incorporate the global information contained in both support vectors and common instances. In this paper, we propose a new method, whose special variant is a semi-supervised extension of Relative Margin Machine, to utilize data more sufficiently based on S 3 VM and LDA. We employ Concave-Convex Pro-cedure to solve the optimization that makes it practical for large-scale datasets, and then give an error bound to guarantee the classifier’s per-formance theoretically. The experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ...|$|E

Furthermore, we propose the novel idea of representing SSL problems as submodular set functions and use efficient sub-modular optimization algorithms to solve them. Using this new idea we develop {{a representation of the}} approximate QP-S 3 VM as a maximization of a submodular set function which makes it possible to optimize using efficient greedy algorithms.
