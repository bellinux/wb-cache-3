25|$|During design, planning, {{maintenance}} and construction, metric is used. As a result, (and anticipating that the roadsigns themselves {{will one day}} be changed to display in metric units) recently erected signs are increasingly being placed at metric intervals but display an imperial unit as required by the current road-signage rules. For example, a 110yd marker might actually be placed at the 100m distance. Since 2008, location marker posts have appeared on motorways and major A roads in England, situated generally at intervals of 500 metres (though the dimension is not given). These repeat the information given on the co-sited surveyors' <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> which, since the 1960s, have reported distances on such roads in kilometres from a datum—usually the start of the road, or the planned start-point of the road.|$|E
500|$|Chiswick Bridge {{is a major}} {{transport}} route, and {{the eighth}} busiest of London's 20 Thames road bridges. It is possibly {{best known for its}} proximity to the finishing line of The Championship Course, the stretch of the Thames used for the Boat Race and other rowing events. A University Boat Race Stone on the south bank, and a brightly painted blue and black <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> near the north bank of the river, [...] downstream of the bridge, mark the end of the course.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, in {{response}} to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find, a follow-up excavation of the field {{was carried out by}} the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single post hole at the southwest corner was identified; this may have been the location of a <b>marker</b> <b>post</b> to enable the depositors of the cache to locate and recover it in the future. Soil was removed in [...] spits for analysis in the area [...] around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items datable to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late Bronze Age or early Iron Age post holes, which may have formed a structure, were found. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.|$|E
