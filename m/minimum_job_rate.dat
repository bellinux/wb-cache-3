To identify the “aggregate business cycle shock, ” I adopt the agnostic Bayesian identification approach developed by Uhlig (2005) and others.

I find that when a negative shock occurs, (i) both the <b>job</b> loss <b>rate</b> and gross <b>job</b> losses rise quickly and remain persistently high, (ii) the <b>job</b> finding <b>rate</b> and vacancies drop in a hump-shaped manner, and (iii) gross hires respond little initially, but eventually rise.
