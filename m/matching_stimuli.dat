40|$|Under usual circumstances, {{motion in}} depth is {{associated}} with conventional stereomotion cues: a change in disparity and differences between object velocities in each monocular image. However, occasionally these cues are unavailable {{due to the fact}} that in one eye the object may be occluded by, or camouflaged against appropriately positioned binocular objects. We report two experiments concerned with stereomotion perception under conditions of monocular camouflage. In Experiment 1, the visible half-image of a monocularly camouflaged object translated laterally. In this binocular context, percepts of lateral motion and motion in depth were equally consistent with the stimulus. Subjects perceived an oblique trajectory of 3 D motion, compared to the more direct 3 D trajectory experienced for binocularly <b>matched</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In Experiment 2, the perceived velocity of stereomotion was assessed.

The effects of providing continuous and noncontingent access to either the most highly preferred matched or the most highly preferred unmatched stimuli were assessed relative to a condition in which no stimuli were available.

In Experiment 1 participants saw a face and heard a voice one after the other. They had to decide whether the stimuli were matching or not matching. When the correct matching stimulus was present participants consistently performed above chance level, regardless of facial stimuli type or stimuli order. When the correct matching stimulus was not present participants were either just guessing (voice first) or significantly below chance (face first).

40|$|Introduction: Cue-reactivity {{is thought}} to play a {{fundamental}} role in the maintenance of addiction. The incentive sensitization theory proposes that conditioned responses are related to increased sensitivity of the reward-related dopaminergic pathways in the brain. However, neuroimaging studies on alcohol cue-reactivity show inconsistent results. Methods: Stimuli content of 26 alcohol cue-reactivity studies was systematically reviewed. Results: No differences were found between alcoholic beverage stimuli and non-alcoholic beverage stimuli in human display and brand factors; however, alcoholic beverage stimuli were more likely to display social interaction compared to non-alcoholic beverage stimuli. Conclusions: Given that processing of social information activates brain areas that partly overlap with reward-related brain areas associated with cue-reactivity, such differences between conditions can introduce noise in the findings. We therefore suggest <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli</b> sets on the reviewed factors carefully to improve reliability of neuroimaging studies investigating alcohol-related cue-reactivity...|$|E

The final results provided in calibrated Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs) on relevant perceptual scales, allowing the prediction of sharpness and contrast appearance with changes in the displayed image size. A series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to enable appearance predictions. Firstly, a rank order experiment was carried out to identify the image attributes that were most affected by changes in displayed image size. Two digital cameras, exhibiting very different reproduction qualities, were employed to capture the same scenes, for {{the investigation of the}} effect of the original image quality on image appearance changes. A wide range of scenes with different scene properties was used as a test-set for the investigation of image appearance changes with scene type. The outcomes indicated that sharpness and contrast were the most important attributes for the majority of scene types and original image qualities. Appearance matching experiments were further conducted to quantify changes in perceived sharpness and contrast with respect to changes in the displayed image size. For the creation of sharpness <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli,</b> a set of frequency domain filters were designed to provide equal intervals in image quality, by taking into account the system’s Spatial Frequency Response (SFR) and the observation distance. For the creation of contrast <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli,</b> a series of spatial domain S-shaped filters were designed to provide equal intervals in image contrast, by gamma adjustments. Five displayed image sizes were investigated. Observers were always asked to match the appearance of the smaller version of each stimulus to its larger reference. Lastly, rating experiments were conducted to validate the derived JNDs in perceptual quality for both sharpness and contrast stimuli. Data obtained by these experiments finally converted into JND scales for each individual image attribute.

The present series of five experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether introduction of a secondary task within a novel dual-task paradigm influences the pattern of interhemispheric collaboration without increasing the complexity of a primary comparison task. Recent {{research suggests that the}} advantage of spreading processing across both hemispheres is predicted to the extent that stimuli to be compared are likely to be processed in similar cortical pathways. To test how degree of cortical access route overlap may modulate hemispheric communication (CAR model), careful selection of primary and secondary stimulus formats was conducted.; For each of the five experiments of the present investigation, observers engaged in the following three types of conditions: (1) three-item comparison task (single primary task), (2) two-item comparison task (single secondary task), (3) three and two-item comparison task (dual-task). The critical comparison involved dual-task primary trials on which the two <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli</b> projected to the same visual field (within-hemisphere trials) versus trials on which the two <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli</b> projected to opposite visual fields (across-hemisphere trials). The results of Experiments 1 (all letters) and 2 (letters and pictures) showed support of the CAR model because an absent across-hemisphere advantage was established during the single primary task and neural overlap explained the across-hemisphere advantage found for the dual-task primary trials of the former but not the latter experiment. Experiments 3 to 5 involved a new application of the dimensions of numerical magnitude, physical size, and luminance to a dual-task paradigm. As an unexpected across-hemisphere advantage was found during the single primary task of experiments, interpretation of performance during the dual-task condition is limited.

Examples from the literature are discussed together with several studies of color naming and basic emotion naming in which no such symmetry was found.

40|$|When {{a target}} grating is flashed into a larger, {{surrounding}} grating, its contrast {{is perceived to}} be lower when both gratings are oriented collinearly rather than orthogonally. This effect can be used to dissociate the perceived contrast from the physical contrast of a target grating. We recorded the transient electric potentials and magnetic fields evoked by flashed target gratings and compared them with psychophysical judgements of perceived contrast. Both early (100 ms) and late (150 ms) transients were reduced in amplitude when targets were flashed into a collinear rather than orthogonal surround, thus paralleling the reduction in perceived contrast. Although targets in orthogonal backgrounds required 40 % lower physical contrast to match the perceived contrast of collinear targets the amplitudes of electrophysiological transients of <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli</b> were almost identical. Thus, the responses correlated better with perceived than with physical target contrast. This holds especially for the late transient response.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nonlinear mechanism underlying brightness enhancement, in which a flickering stimulus appears brighter than a steady stimulus of equal mean luminance. The flickering and <b>matching</b> <b>stimuli</b> were temporally alternated. Both were cosine windowed to minimize the potential effects of temporal transients. Subjects adjusted the amplitude of the matching stimulus to match it in brightness to the flickering stimulus. The temporal frequency, modulation, and waveform of the flickering stimulus were varied. With sinusoidal flicker, brightness enhancement increased with increasing modulation at all frequencies, peaking at about 16 Hz at full modulation. The results were modeled by a broad temporal filter followed by a single accelerating nonlinearity. The derived temporal sensitivity of the early filter inferred from brightness enhancement decreased more slowly at high frequencies than the filter(s) inferred from flicker modulation thresholds. With low frequency sawtooth flicker, brightness enhancement was phase-dependent at low, but not at high modulations, suggesting that multiple neural mechanisms may also be involved in addition to an early nonlinearity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFluids {{and other}} {{deformable}} materials have highly mutable shapes, which are visibly influenced by both intrinsic properties (e. g. viscosity) and extrinsic forces (e. g. gravity, object interactions). How do we identify a liquid’s intrinsic properties across profound variations in shape caused by extrinsic factors? Previous findings suggest we are surprisingly good at matching viscosity across large variations in shape (“liquid constancy”). Here we ask which visual cues {{enable us to}} do this. Somehow the visual system abstracts features that are common to different instances of a liquid, while suppressing large differences in shape caused by extrinsic factors. In this study we tried to specify which geometric features observers use to achieve liquid constancy. We simulated eight variations of pouring liquids with seven different viscosities (‘test stimuli’). Each variation was influenced by a different noise force field, like gusts of wind that changed the way the liquid flowed, leading to substantial shape differences over time. Observers adjusted the viscosity of another variation (‘match stimulus’) until {{it appeared to be}} the same material as each test. We tested several time offsets to create volume differences between test and <b>match</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The experiment was performed with static and one-second moving stimuli. We find that observers show a high degree of constancy in matching the viscosity across the different variations. However, volume differences between test and <b>match</b> <b>stimulus,</b> especially with static stimuli, caused large effects of over- and under-estimation of viscosity. We then analyzed the 3 D shapes of the samples to extract a wide range of shape measurements related to viscosity. We find that a number of cues related to curvatures, periodic movements of the liquids, and the way they spread out predict aspects of the observer’s performance, but that humans achieve better constancy than the cues predict...|$|R

40|$|Five {{experiments}} assessed associative symmetry in pigeons.

By contrast, Experiment 3 demonstrated symmetry in successive (go/no-go) matching, replicating the findings of Frank and Wasserman (2005). In view of these results, I propose that in successive matching, (1) the functional stimuli are stimulus–temporal location compounds, (2) continual nonreinforcement of some sample–comparison combinations juxtaposed with reinforcement of other combinations throughout training facilitates stimulus class formation, (3) classes consist of the elements of the reinforced combinations, and (4) common elements produce class merger. The theory predicts that particular sets of training relations should yield “antisymmetry”: Pigeons should respond more to a reversal of the nonreinforced symbolic baseline relations than to a reversal of the reinforced relations. Experiment 4 confirmed this counterintuitive prediction. These results and other theoretical implications support the idea that equivalence relations are a natural consequence of reinforcement contingencies...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} assess {{the extent to which}} spatial and verbal-analytic (VA) information processing resources are used in performing a simulated aircraft navigation task. Subjects were required to decide whether a 'match' or a mismatch' existed between a schematic 3 D perspective forward field of view and a 2 D top-down map. On dual-task trials, this navigation task was concurrently performed with either a VA side-task or with one of two tracking tasks. The data suggest that a VA strategy was most likely to be used when stimuli were simple or were mismatches, whereas a spatial mental rotation strategy was apparently used to confirm complex <b>match</b> <b>stimuli.</b> These results indicate that {{it may be possible to}} specify conditions wherein navigation is likely to compete for resources critical to other cockpit activities, such as aircraft control and communication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In single trial analysis, {{when using}} Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) signals, the {{selection}} of principal components (PCs) is an important issue. We propose a new method here that selects only the appropriate PCs. We denote the method as selective eigen-rate (SER). In the method, the VEP is reconstructed based on {{the rate of the}} eigen-values of the PCs. When this technique is applied on emulated VEP signals added with background electroencephalogram (EEG), with a focus on extracting the evoked P 3 parameter, it is found to be feasible. The improvement in signal to noise ratio (SNR) is superior to two other existing methods of PC selection: Kaiser (KSR) and Residual Power (RP). Though another PC selection method, Spectral Power Ratio (SPR) gives a comparable SNR with high noise factors (i. e. EEGs), SER give more impressive results in such cases. Next, we applied SER method to real VEP signals to analyse the P 3 responses for <b>matched</b> and non-matched <b>stimuli.</b> The P 3 parameters extracted through our proposed SER method showed higher P 3 response for <b>matched</b> <b>stimulus,</b> which confirms to the existing neuroscience knowledge. Single trial PCA using KSR and RP methods failed to indicate any difference for the stimuli. Keywords—Electroencephalogram, P 3, Single trial VEP...|$|R
