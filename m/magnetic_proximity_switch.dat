40|$|AbstractA Smart Clamping Force Control (SCFC) {{is adapted}} to hold {{sensitive}} workpiece using <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>switch</b> during a machining operation on the CNC machine tool. It has been ascertained that work-holding of different workpiece materials and shapes during machining operation {{is one of the}} problems encountered during CNC milling machining operations. This work proposes a novel clamping strategy for workpieces with the aid of SCFC. The purpose of the study is to adjust the forward movement of the clamp and reduce the damage caused by the clamp on the workpiece, this depends on the material of the work-piece. The speed of the clamp is reduced using the inlet flow control throttle valve and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>switch</b> (MPS). It provides careful handling of workpiece and prevent it from damage and as well optimizes the forward movement of the cylinder. The proposed strategy is based on dynamic machine loading in which the impact of applied forces were monitored to optimize the clamping control system of the machine tool. The mode of operation and performance of the SCFC were simulated in the FluidSIMÂ® software, and the validated results was presented on Festo workstation. This work therefore further elucidate the fundamental design criterion for machine tool clamping forces and the sustainable manufacture of its components...|$|E

40|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effect {{between two}} {{magnetic}} layers {{is an important}} focus of research for discovering new physical properties of magnetic systems. Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are fundamental systems with magnetic ordering and promising candidate materials in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effect between antiferromagnetic bilayers is rarely studied because detecting the spin orientation of AFMs is challenging. Using X-ray linear dichroism and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we investigated antiferromagnetic proximity effects in epitaxial CoO/NiO/MgO(001) systems. We found the antiferromagnetic spin of the NiO underwent a spin reorientation transition from in-plane to out-of-plane with increasing NiO thickness, with the existence of vertical exchange spring spin alignment in thick NiO. More interestingly, the Neel temperature of the CoO layer was greatly enhanced by the adjacent NiO layer, with {{the extent of the}} enhancement closely dependent on the spin orientation of NiO layer. This phenomenon was attributed to different exchange coupling strengths at the AFM/AFM interface depending on the relative spin directions. Our results indicate a new route for modifying the spin configuration and ordering temperature of AFMs through the <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effect near room temperature, which should further benefit the design of AFM spintronic devices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpintronic devices {{based on}} pure spin {{currents}} have drawn {{a lot of}} attention during the last few years for low energy device design. One approach to generate pure spin currents is to combine a metallic or insulating ferromagnetic layer with a non-magnetic metallic layer with a large spin-orbit coupling. A recent controversy has arisen in the possible role of <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effects at ferromagnetic/ non-magnetic interfaces, which can hamper the understanding of pure spin current generation mechanisms. While <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effects have been frequently observed at ferromagnetic metal/non-magnetic interfaces, {{there are only a few}} studies on ferromagnetic insulator/non-magnetic interfaces. Regarding the use of ferromagnetic insulators, the focus has been mainly on yttrium iron garnet (YIG). However, investigation of induced magnetic moments at YIG/Pt interfaces has engendered contradictory results. Here, we propose to study insulating ferrites for which electronic and magnetic properties can be modulated. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effects have been investigated at MnFe 2 O 4 /Pt, CoFe 2 O 4 /Pt, and NiFe 2 O 4 /Pt interfaces by X-ray circular magnetic dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Pt L 3 edge. Although hybridization with Pt seems to be different among the ferrites, we do not detect any XMCD signal as the signature of an induced magnetism in Pt. We have then studied the Fe 3 O 4 ferrite below and above the Verwey transition temperature. No XMCD signal has been measured in the insulating or conducting phase of Fe 3 O 4. This suggests that the absence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>proximity</b> effects at ferrite/Pt interfaces is not linked to the insulating character or not of the ferrites...|$|R
