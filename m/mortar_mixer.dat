30|$|The mortars were {{prepared}} in a semiautomatic standard <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer.</b> Mixing was performed according to ASTM C 305 - 99 (ASTM 1999) for the reference and the LWA mixtures, the superplasticizer was completely pre-dissolved in the mixing water. For the SAP mortars all dry ingredients were pre-mixed for 30  s, the superplasticizer was added pre-solved {{with the water}} during the following 90  s of mixing. The total mixing time from first water addition was 5 for LWA and 8  min for LWA and SAP.|$|E
30|$|Setting times (initial and final) for the {{different}} percentages of CA and MS starch additions in cement were determined under controlled humidity and temperature. The percentages of starch added to the cement are 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 respectively. The tests complied with the South African standard SANS 50196 - 3 : 2006 and EN 196 - 3 : 2005. Standard <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> set to EN mixing standard was used {{to carry out the}} mixing of {{the different}} cement pastes with various concentrations of starches.

30|$|The {{interface}} {{and bond}} between concrete and reinforcing steel {{are the most}} fundamental problems of reinforced concrete structures. In this paper, the pull-out strength of galvanized steel strips with different geometries and hole patterns in foam concrete blocks are investigated experimentally and numerically. Foam concrete mixtures of 1, 200 -kg/m 3 density were obtained by mixing cement and water in a <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> together with ultrafoam as the foaming agent and Quick-Gel as the viscosifier. A theoretical model is developed to predict the bond-slip relationship between the strip and the concrete. This model is further implemented in a finite element simulation of the pull-out tests through the ABAQUS user subroutine. The results show good correlation between experimental, theoretical, and finite element simulation analyses. The influence of the steel strip geometries on the maximum pull-out force is also studied, and {{it was found that}} the strips with the greatest hole area, hole diameter, and circumference areas have higher pull-out forces and the increase is nearly linear.|$|E
30|$|All the raw {{materials}} were dry mixed at low speed in the <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> for 1  min to obtain a homogenous mix. Then water, SP and SA (as required) were added and mixed for 3  min, followed by a final high speed mixing for another 1  min. Mortar samples were then poured in 50  mm ×  50  mm ×  50  mm steel moulds. The samples were covered with a plastic sheet, cured in room temperature for 24  h, de-moulded (except CF and S 1 which were de-moulded after 48  h and 36  h respectively, because of low early strength) and then further cured in saturated lime water at room temperature as per ASTM C 109 until the time of testing. The samples were taken out of lime water, wiped and surface dried after 1, 7 and 28  days of curing. Compressive strength of the mortar samples was measured as per ASTM C 109 using a 300 kN tecnotest mortar strength testing machine. For every mix at each age, three replicates were tested at a loading rate of 0.36  MPa/s.|$|E
30|$|Further, two {{different}} type of nano-silica namely powder nano-silica (~ 40  nm) prepared in laboratory using sodium silicate as precursor and colloidal nano-silica (15 – 20  nm) was commercially available as an aqueous dispersion having the pH value of 9.2, and SiO 2 content (by weight) of 30  % corresponds to a density of 1.28  g/mL. The specific surface area of colloidal-NS is {{in the range of}} 170 – 200  m 2 /g. For introducing nano-silica into cement mortar ultrasonic treatment was used to disperse the agglomerates. In this method nano-silica and water were sonicated for 30  min at 42  kHz frequency and 80 watt absorbed power using a 2.5  L capacity bath sonicator till the solution turned milky. Afterwards, this sonicated mixture was mixed for 1  min with cement and sand in the Hobart mixer having B-type blade. <b>Mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> as per the standard ASTM C 144 was used for mortar preparation. The mixer was equipped with B- flat type peddles, having minimum and maximum revolution speed of 140  ±  5  rpm and 285  ±  10  rpm, respectively. The capacity of the bowl was ~ 5  L.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, stonemasonry saw {{its most}} radical {{changes in the}} way the work is accomplished. Prior to {{the first half of the}} century, most heavy work was {{executed}} by draft animals or human muscle power. With the arrival of the internal combustion engine, many of these hard aspects of the trade have been made simpler and easier. Cranes and forklifts have made moving and laying heavy stones relatively easy for the stonemasons. Motor powered <b>mortar</b> <b>mixers</b> have saved much in time and energy as well. Compressed-air powered tools have made working of stone less time-intensive. Petrol and electric powered abrasive saws can cut through stone much faster and with more precision than chiseling alone. Carbide-tipped chisels can stand up to much more abuse than the steel and iron chisels made by blacksmiths of old.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{engineering}} performance and CO 2 footprint of <b>mortar</b> <b>mixers</b> by replacing Portland cement with 10 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 % fly ash, a common industrial waste material. Samples of self-compacting mortar (SCM) were prepared with four different water/binder ratios and varying dosages of superplasticizer to give three ranges of workability, i. e., normal, high and self-compacting mortar mix. The engineering performance was assessed {{in term of}} compressive strength after designated curing periods for all mixes. CO 2 footprint was the environmental impact indicator of each production stage. The optimum mix obtained was at 10 % replacement rate for all mixes. Total production emission reduced by 56 % when the fly ash replacement rate increased from 0 % to 60 % (maximum). This is translated to a reduction of 80 % in eco-points (assuming that the energy consumption rate of production with 0 % fly ash is at 100 %). Such re-utilization is encouraged since {{it is able to}} reduce possible soil toxicity due to sulfur leaching by 5 % to 27 % and landfill area by 15 % to 91 % on average...|$|R

40|$|Knot rejects {{obtained}} from pulp screening after sulphite pulping {{are difficult to}} dewater, which makes landfilling expensive and burning inefficient. The rejects were found to contain up to 50 % cellulose, which is very susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Knot rejects were hydrolyzed at 20 % consistency in a laboratory peg mixer with cellulase enzyme. The thick slurry was liquefied within the first hour of mixing and resulted in a glucose concentration of over 100 g/L after 24 hours of reaction. This solution was fermented by yeast to give an ethanol concentration of over 5 %. The laboratory results were confirmed at pilot scale with a <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> (high consistency) or stirred tank reactor (medium consistency) at the 400 L and 6000 L scales, respectively. It was found that washing the knots with ammonia resulted in increased glucose conversion. Enzyme costs could be lowered by separating the enzyme from the hydrolyzed sugars by membrane ultrafiltration and recycling the enzyme to the subsequent batch of substrate. The combination of high-consistency hydrolysis and enzyme recycling minimizes capital investment, energy requirements, and enzyme costs, which are significant factors in the overall economic viability of cellulose conversion to ethanol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Geopolymer {{synthesis}} has {{two main}} requirements to fulfil {{which are the}} source material that is rich in Silicon (Si) and Aluminum (Al) and alkali activator such as sodium/potassium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is widely used for the synthesis of geopolymer compared to potassium hydroxide (KOH) with addition of silicate solution {{for the purpose of}} increasing dissolution process. However, the comparison of using different activator in the absence of silicate solution for geopolymer synthesis is not well established. This paper presents an evaluation on compressive strength of fly ash–based geopolymer by using different activator (KOH and NaOH) with respect to different curing conditions (time and temperature) in the absence of sodium silicate. The samples were mixed using <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> and prepared in 50 mm x 50 mm x 50 mm mould for determination of compressive strength. It can be observed that the highest compressive strength up 65. 28 MPa was obtained using NaOH. Meanwhile, synthesis using KOH only recorded 28. 73 MPa. The compressive strength was better when cured at elevated temperature (60 oC) than room temperature (25 oC). Further analysis on the microstructure of the highest compressive strength geopolymer samples for both activators was carried out using Field Emission Scanning Microscopy (FESEM) and Raman spectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|When {{dealing with}} the issue of repair of {{concrete}} pavement repair using dowel bar retrofit technique, it is very desirable for the repair material to have high fluidity that can ensure good compaction and facilitate flow to tight spaces, preferably without the use of a vibrator. The focus of this project was on identifying critical properties that control long-term performance of repair concrete, especially rapid-setting materials extended using pea gravel (maximum size aggregate 9. 5 mm). ^ In the first phase of this project, four commercial rapid-setting materials (CRSMs) were selected and development of mixture proportions in terms of optimum pea gravel content and water content was performed. Optimized mixtures were further evaluated at three different initial temperature conditions. The properties evaluated included workability, setting time, rate of compressive strength developed, slant shear bond strength, freeze-thaw resistance, air-content of hardened concrete, drying shrinkage and cracking potential. It was observed that some of the CRSMs evaluated did not meet the requirements of ASTM C 928. All except one CRSM tested exhibited low resistance to freezing and thawing but all had high resistance to cracking. ^ In {{the second phase of the}} project, rapid-setting self-consolidating concrete (RSSCC) was developed through 6 stages using a ternary blend of cementitious materials, high-range water reducer (HRWR) and accelerators. Slump flow, VSI, compressive strength at various ages and the power consumption values for the <b>mortar</b> <b>mixer</b> indicated that a five minutes mixing sequence involving a 2 -Step addition of HRWR stable RSSCC mixture. The results of various tests carried out in the 6 Stages indicate that it is possible to develop a small aggregate size-based self-consolidating repair concrete that achieves a compressive strength of 19 MPa at the end of 6 hrs, has good bond characteristics and excellent freezing and thawing durability (DF 3 ̆e 90...|$|E
