50|$|Until this time, central London's drains {{were built}} {{primarily}} {{to cope with}} rain water, and the growing use of flush toilets frequently meant these became overloaded, <b>flushing</b> <b>mud,</b> shingle, sewage and industrial effluent into the River Thames.

60|$|As {{she was not}} fond of either, it was a sure {{proof of}} the sincerity of her regard for the persons who have made them immortal. They went into an eating-house, and ordered the lunch, finding {{themselves}} objects {{of interest to the}} other guests. But, though a walking doormat in point of <b>mud,</b> and somewhat <b>flushed</b> and excited by the hustling, climbing, and adoring, it is certain there wasn't a happier spinster in this 'Piljin Projess of a wale,' than the one who partook of 'weal pie' in memory of Sam Weller, and drank 'a modest quencher' to the health of Dick Swiveller {{at the end of that}} delightful Dickens day.|$|R
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet <b>mud</b> of base-enriched <b>flushes</b> or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|R
25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to <b>flush</b> <b>mud</b> off.|$|R
40|$|A six-month-long {{study was}} {{conducted}} of the fate of turbid river plumes from the Enipein watershed in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. Pohnpei {{is one of the}} wettest places on earth, with a mean annual rainfall exceeding 4 m in the lowlands and 8 m in the highlands. The river waters were clear of sediment except after major storms with rainfall exceeding 5 cm day− 1. Following a storm, the river plume spread in the mangrove fringed estuary and in the coral reef lagoon. The waters were highly stratified in temperature, salinity, and suspended sediment concentration. The brackish water was flushed out in four days, while the suspended sediment all settled out in the estuary, in the mangroves, and in the lagoon including on the coral reefs, in less than one day. The mean rate of sedimentation exceeded 35 mg cm− 2 d− 1 both over the mangroves and on the adjacent coral reefs. While this leads to no detrimental effects on the mangroves, sediment smothers corals and leads to substantial coral mortality in the lagoon. The <b>mud</b> is not <b>flushed</b> out from the lagoon because there are no strong currents from waves or tides. This high sedimentation rate is attributable to poor farming and land-use practices on the upland areas...|$|R
40|$|Pore water {{transport}} {{and its implications}} for mineralization and nutrient release from the sediment were studied in intertidal permeable sands of the German Wadden Sea. During ebb tide, the hydraulic gradient developing between the pore water level and the faster dropping sea water level caused drainage and seepage of pore water from the sediment near the low water line. As a result, pore water nutrient and DIC concentrations were independent of the season and up to 15 -times higher than at the upper flat. Nutrient fluxes associated with the seepage exceeded 5 to 8 -fold those fluxes caused by the combined effects of diffusion, advection and bioirrigation during inundation and may enhance primary production in the Wadden Sea. The drainage affects deep sediment layers and is characterized by long flow paths and pore water residence times. This 'body circulation' is only active during low tide and can act as buffered nutrient source to the ecosystem. During inundation of the tidal flat, oxygen penetrated deeper into the sediment than during exposure, driven by hydrodynamic forcing. Oxygen consumption rates were high and sulfate reduction contributed 3 - 25 % to total mineralization. In another intertidal sand flat, oxygen consumption and sulfate reduction rates decreased from the low water line towards the upper flat and were closely linked to inundation time. The advectively flushed surface layer of the sediment is characterized by short flow paths and low pore water residence time. An immediate feedback of benthic mineralization to the ecosystem can be provided by this 'skin circulation' during inundation. Intertidal sands were also shown to support relatively high benthic primary production while submersed. Gross photosynthesis was on average 4 and 11 times higher in the net autotrophic fine and coarse sand than in the net heterotrophic mud, despite higher chlorophyll content in the mud. Light limitation was less severe at the sandy sites, and two to three times more light was available to the microalgae in the sands than in the <b>mud.</b> The advective <b>flushing</b> of the permeable sands removed chlorophyll decomposition products and may have enhanced benthic photosynthesis by counteracting a possible CO 2 limitation of the microalgae...|$|R
40|$|Northern Bahr el Ghazal area {{in southwestern}} part of Sudan was {{severely}} {{affected by the}} civil wars in Sudan. This has led to lacks of development in most areas, not least water supply. In combination with {{a high number of}} refugees returning to the area the water situation is very difficult. This study is made to investigate how the water project of International Aid Services (IAS) is working. First I wanted to get a good image of the different areas connected to the IAS water project such as community mobilization, drilling and water source and sanitation education. At the time of my studies the Community Mobilization Unit (CMU) had just began their work, therefore the system with Water Source and Sanitation Committees had not yet been really implemented. However, some had been formed but not trained. The drilling is performed using two different methods, Mud Rotary and Air <b>Flush.</b> <b>Mud</b> Rotary is used in clay soil and Air Flush is used in more rocky soil. One of the main problem issues is transport, mainly transport of drilling machines, well material and water used during drilling. Problems in the means of transport are the terrible conditions of the roads which also lead to terrible conditions of the vehicles, especially the heavy vehicles which are very old. Another main problem is supplies, especially supplies of spares for the vehicles and equipment but also food and other essentials. Many things have to be brought from other countries via Khartoum and then by lorry to Northern Bahr el Ghazal. One of my conclusions is that much weight must be put on the county community mobilization to really involve the local people in the project so that they feel responsible for the well after it has been handed over. This is crucial to get full impact of the project. Another conclusion is that if supplies could be handled through Southern Sudan (Juba) it could cut down transport time and costs. But this cannot be realized yet since the range of things in Juba is rather limited compared to Khartoum. Finally I believe that the personnel must be very observant for coming breakdowns and report this immediately to enable ordering spares, etc. as soon as possible and minimize the time standing still...|$|R
