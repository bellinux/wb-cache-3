40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} fast 3 D {{chemical}} shift imaging technique for the noninvasive measurement of hyperpolarized ^(13) C-labeled substrates and metabolic products at low concentration. Materials and Methods: <b>Multiple</b> <b>echo</b> 3 D balanced steady state magnetic resonance imaging (ME- 3 DbSSFP) was performed in vitro on a syringe containing hyperpolarized [1, 3, 3 - 2 H 3; 1 -^(13) C] 2 -hydroxyethylpropionate (HEP) adjacent to a ^(13) C-enriched acetate phantom, and in vivo on a rat before and after intravenous injection of hyperpolarized HEP at 1. 5 T. Chemical shift images of the hyperpolarized HEP were derived from the <b>multiple</b> <b>echo</b> data by Fourier transformation along the echoes on a voxel by voxel basis for each slice of the 3 D data set. Results: ME- 3 DbSSFP imaging was able to provide chemical shift images of hyperpolarized HEP in vitro, and in a rat with isotropic 7 -mm spatial resolution, 93 Hz spectral resolution and 16 -s temporal resolution for a period greater than 45 s.
