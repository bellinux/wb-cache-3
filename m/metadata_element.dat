40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study that {{examined}} the metadata standards and formats used by a select number of research data services, namely Datacite, Dataverse Network, Dryad, and FigShare. These services make use of {{a broad range of}} <b>metadata</b> practices and <b>elements.</b> The specific objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the number and nature of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> specific to research data, compliance with interoperability and preservation standards, the use of controlled vocabularies for subject description and access and the extent of support for unique identifiers as well as the common and different <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> across these services. The study found that there was a variety of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> used by the research data services and that the use of controlled vocabularies was common across the services. It was found that preservation and unique identifiers are central components of the studied services. An interesting observation was the extent of research data specific <b>metadata</b> <b>elements,</b> with Dryad making use of a wider range of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> specific to research data than other services...|$|R

40|$|Most system {{metadata}} {{development in}} Malaysian libraries deploys a top-down approach in which actual users were not involved. This {{resulted in the}} failure of the system to adequately meet the users’ pragmatic needs. As studies on metadata pragmatic used are rare in the library bibliographic databases, this study investigated common system <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> used by Malaysian libraries in describing information objects in the domain of banking and finance, and the preferred user <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> in locating the needed information. Specifically, this study addresses two important questions, namely (1) what are the <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> preferred by users when searching for library resources on Islamic finance, and (2) how compatible are the system metadata with preferred user <b>metadata</b> <b>elements?</b> This study deployed the conceptual framework of collaborative metadata approach to identify compatibility <b>elements</b> between user <b>metadata</b> and system metadata...|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was aimed {{to study the}} scope of presence of Dublin Core <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> and HTML meta tags in web pages. Ninety web pages were chosen by searching general search engines (Google, Yahoo and MSN). The scope of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> (Dublin Core and HTML Meta tags) present in these pages as well as existence of a significant correlation between presence of meta elements and type of search engines were investigated. Findings indicated very low presence of both Dublin Core <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> and HTML meta tags in the pages retrieved which in turn illustrates the very low usage of meta data elements in web pages. Furthermore, findings indicated {{that there are no}} significant correlation between the type of search engine used and presence of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements.</b> From the standpoint of including metadata in retrieval of web sources, search engines do not significantly differ from one another...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to make exam the indexing and ranking of XML content objects containing Dublin Core and MARC 21 <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> in dynamic online information environments by general search engines and comparing them together in a comparative-analytical approach. 100 XML content objects in two groups were analyzed: those with DCXML elements and those with MARCXML elements were published in website [URL] from late Mordad 1388 till Khordad 1389. Then the website was introduced to Google and Yahoo search engines. Google search engine was able to retrieve fully all the content objects during the study period through their Dublin Core and MARC 21 metadata elements; Yahoo search engine, however, did not respond at all. The indexing of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> embedded in content objects in dynamic online information environments and different between indexing and ranking of them were examined. Findings showed all Dublin Core and MARC 21 <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> by Google search engine were indexed. And there was not observed difference between indexing and ranking DCXML and MARCXML <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> in dynamic online information environments by Google search engine...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to measure the effectiveness of <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> on the web page visibility in three public search engines: Google, Yahoo, and MSN. The effectiveness of the five <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> including HTML title tag, HTML Keywords and Description meta-tags, Title and Subject Dublin Core <b>Metadata</b> <b>Elements,</b> which concentrate on subject representation of the web page, were examined using the experimental method. 84 web pages were designed and submitted in both control and case groups. Among 3 public search engines only Google and Yahoo index the submitted pages. Unique and repeated keywords embedded as <b>metadata</b> <b>elements</b> were searched, and the significant differences between rankings of the two groups were examined by non-parametric U Mann-Whitney Test. Findings reveal the significant role of HTML Title tag and HTML Description Meta tag in two studied search engines. In comparison to repeated keywords, unique keywords in HTML Keywords Meta tag and Dublin Core Subject metadata improved the visibility of web pages in Yahoo search engine. While using repeated keywords in head section of HTML documents enhanced the rankings of web pages in Yahoo, results show the converse retrievability performance in Google search engine...|$|R

50|$|Subsequent to the {{specification}} {{of the original}} 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the Dublin Core <b>Metadata</b> <b>Element</b> Set (DCMES) was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the AgMES metadata schema is the ability to link between the <b>metadata</b> <b>element</b> and controlled vocabularies. The use of controlled vocabulary provides a [...] "known" [...] set of options to the indexer (and the search programmer) as to how the field can be filled out. Often the values may come from a specific thesaurus (e.g. AGROVOC) or classification schemes (e.g. the AGRIS/CARIS classification scheme) etc.|$|E

Each facet can be mapped to a specific Dublin Core element. For example, the geographic facet can be mapped to the coverage element in the basic Dublin Core <b>Metadata</b> <b>Element</b> Set, and to the coverage.geographic element in qualified Dublin Core.|$|E
