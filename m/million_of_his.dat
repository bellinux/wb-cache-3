5|$|In the 2003–04 season Hašek {{injured his}} groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, {{he and the}} team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland {{that he would not}} accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he {{announced}} {{that he was not going}} to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher and Lloyd Webber {{restarted}} {{development for}} The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. {{in an attempt}} to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own money. The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used for marketing, bringing the final budget to $70 million. Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution; the studio did not sign on until June 2003, when the principal cast was chosen.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2008, Ao {{was found}} guilty on 40 counts of bribe-taking, 13 counts of money laundering, two counts of abuse of power, one count of {{incorrect}} declaration of assets and one count of holding assets from unknown sources; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison. About MOP 252 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most Macanese were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his superior in government, Edmond Ho.|$|E

5|$|On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E
5|$|With his {{original}} NHL contract expiring in the off-season, Kariya and the Ducks struggled {{to agree on}} a new deal. As a result, Kariya missed the first 32 games of the 1997–98 campaign. After making $2.1 million the previous season, he was reportedly asking for a three-year deal worth $27 million, while the Ducks countered with five-year, $25 million and seven-year, $49 million contracts. Both sides eventually agreed on a two-year, $14 million deal in December 1997. While the initial year of the contract paid Kariya a pro-rated salary of $5.5 million (it was also agreed in contract negotiations that Kariya would donate $2 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first year's salary to Orange County charities), the second year of the contract paid him $8.5 million, making him the second-highest paid player in League history (behind Mario Lemieux's $11 million salary in 1996–97). During his absence from the Ducks, Kariya trained with the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Due to the contract impasse, he missed an opportunity to play in his father's home country, Japan, as the Mighty Ducks opened the season with a two-game series against the Vancouver Canucks in Tokyo—an effort on the NHL's part to attract attention to the sport ahead of the Olympics. In his first game back, he recorded two goals and two assists, helping the Mighty Ducks rally from a three-goal deficit to beat the Washington Capitals 6–4. During the second period of the contest, he took a team record seven shots on goal.|$|E

25|$|The Trump Organization has curtailed {{some of its}} {{international}} work, pulling out of deals in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Brazil, while pledging to do no new foreign deals (though it has apparently resurrected an old deal in the Dominican Republic). Trump’s international hotel licensing and management business only makes up $220 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estimated $3.5 billion fortune, but it’s the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio—and it throws off chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic agreements.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{took off}} when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 {{that he would}} use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a sure thing. The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election {{to take place in}} late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E

He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.|$|E

He spent $73 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one. One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering {{from the effects of}} the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.|$|E
