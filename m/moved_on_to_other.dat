5|$|Brettingham <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design {{one of the greatest}} mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported. The rumours later proved false however. While Sony {{contemplated}} {{the notion of}} a G-Police game for the PlayStation 2 (who had bought Psygnosis, renaming it Studio Liverpool), they decided that, because G-Police was not as successful as other games, Studio Liverpool would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises. Furthermore, the development team responsible for G-Police and Weapons of Justice had <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> ventures. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3. Computer and Video Games noted that the graphics looked poor by current standards but deemed it still enjoyable to play.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness was commercially {{successful}} {{following its}} December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000cabinets were sold, and {{it soon became}} the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to Marble Madnesss short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.|$|E

Benfica then contacted Getafe manager Michael Laudrup and Brazilian manager Zico. After failing {{to come to terms with}} either, the club turned to first choice Sánchez Flores and signed him on 24 May. Sánchez Flores would be aided by technical assistant Fran Escribá, goalkeeper coach Emilio Álvarez and fitness coach Pako Ayestarán, with Diamantino Miranda and Chalana links to club management.|$|E
5|$|SIM Lite was {{originally}} proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). As {{a result of}} continued budget cuts, the launch date was pushed back at least five times. NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015. As of February 2007, many of the engineers working on the SIM program had <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> areas and projects, and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction. However, the preliminary budget for NASA for 2008 included zero dollars for SIM.|$|E

Virginia Tech co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless resigned to become the defensive coordinator at Rutgers University. Tech defensive line coach Todd Grantham was replaced by Charley Wiles after Grantham resigned to take the same job at Michigan State. To prevent Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer from likewise seeking a different position, the school signed him to a new five-year contract at a salary of more than $148,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E

No {{announcement}} of the band's dissolution was ever made, but in 2013 the three remaining members formed a secular country music trio called JEBtown, which played at least one show in Nashville and filmed a music video for a studio track. By 2014, the band members had <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects. Josh Reedy toured as a bass player with Chris Cagle, then joined Thomas Rhett's band as a keyboardist and guitarist.

5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
