5|$|In the {{canonical}} I Ching, the hexagrams {{are arranged in}} an order dubbed the King Wen sequence after King Wen of Zhou, who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> The sequence generally pairs hexagrams with their upside-down equivalents, although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion. Another order, found at Mawangdui in 1973, arranges the hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper trigram. But the oldest known manuscript, found in 1987 and now held by the Shanghai Library, was almost certainly arranged in the King Wen sequence, and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence. Whichever of these arrangements is older, it is not evident that {{the order of the}} hexagrams was of interest to the original authors of the Zhou yi. The assignment of numbers, binary or decimal, to specific hexagrams is a modern invention.|$|E

25|$|Historicism is a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> in Christian eschatology which interprets biblical prophecies {{as actual}} {{historical}} events and identifies symbolic beings with historical persons or {{societies in the}} history of the church. This interpretation was favored by the Protestant reformers such as John Wycliff and Martin Luther, as well as other prominent figures such as Isaac Newton. Modern theological proponents of this view are further convinced by the perceived resemblances of liturgical practices and ordinances to the Akkadian religious system and those evolved from it. One such example is the miter's comparison to the dead fish as a traditional vestment of the head priests who served the god of the sea, specifically fishing, and of fertility: Dagon.|$|E

This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the Shade of the Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E

The thesis reveals, denominates, and defines, through quoting examples, thirteen main <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> Hebrew biblical proper names, which include the following: identification with words of identical consonants, derivation from verb roots, decomposition, repeated use of the consonants, notaricon, gematry, atbash, ahas bata, retrograde reading, metathesis, replacement of consonants, transposition of all consonants and derivation from other language. For every given method, the thesis cites the source of onomatological phenomenon, analyzes it and tries to apply the interpretation method on other Hebrew biblical proper names which are not yet decoded.

Nisbet outlined reasons why certain sections, most notably the seemingly Isaian section in and around line 22, are best explained through the Easterners' <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Other sections, however, such as lines 26–36—which Nisbet argued were written in a style akin to Greco-Roman prophecies (and whose wording suggests [...] "the ideals of Virgil's own society")—should be viewed through the Westerners' lens. Ultimately, Nisbet concluded that Virgil was not interested in Jewish eschatology [...] "for its own sake"; however, he probably appropriated elements from Jewish prophecy via Eastern oracles, and adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.|$|E
2500|$|Camping did not {{consider}} Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority.

Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book 1994?, he claimed {{there was a very}} high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book [...] "the possibility does exist that I could be wrong"; Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return.

2500|$|A few {{examples}} will illustrate {{this difference in}} the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> between the older and the younger Halakah. It was a generally accepted opinion that the first Passover celebrated in Egypt, that of the Exodus, differed from those that followed it, in that at the first one the prohibition of leavened bread was for a single day only, whereas at subsequent Passovers this restriction extended to seven days. The older halakha (in Mek., Bo, 16 [...] ), represented by R. Jose the Galilean, bases its interpretation on a different division of the sentences in Ex. xiii. than the one generally received; connecting the word [...] "ha-yom" [...] (= [...] "this day"), {{which is the first}} word of verse 4, with verse 3 and so making the passage read: [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten this day." [...] The younger halakha reads [...] "ha-yom" [...] with verse 4, and finds its support for the traditional halakha by means of the principle of [...] "semukot" [...] (collocation); that is to say, the two sentences, [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten," [...] and [...] "This day came ye out," [...] though they are separated grammatically, are immediately contiguous in the text, and exert an influence over each other (Pes. 28b, 96b). What the older halakha regarded as the obvious meaning of the words of the text, the younger infers from the collocation of the sentences.|$|E

2500|$|The pro-slavery South {{could point}} to slaveholding by the godly patriarch Abraham (Gen 12:5; 14:14; 24:35–36; 26:13–14), a {{practice}} that was later incorporated into Israelite national law (Lev 25:44–46). It was never denounced by Jesus, who made slavery a model of discipleship (Mk 10:44). The Apostle Paul supported slavery, counseling obedience to earthly masters (Eph 6:5–9; Col 3:22–25) as a duty in agreement with [...] "the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness" [...] (1 Tim 6:3). Because slaves were to remain in their present state unless they could win their freedom (1 Cor 7:20–24), he sent the fugitive slave Onesimus back to his owner Philemon (Phlm 10–20). The abolitionist north {{had a difficult time}} matching the pro-slavery south passage for passage. [...] Professor Eugene Genovese, who has studied these biblical debates over slavery in minute detail, concludes that the pro-slavery faction clearly emerged victorious over the abolitionists except for one specious argument based on the so-called Curse of Ham (Gen 9:18–27). For our purposes, it is important to realize that the South won this crucial contest with the North by using the prevailing hermeneutic, or <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> on which both sides agreed. So decisive was its triumph that the South mounted a vigorous counterattack on the abolitionists as infidels who had abandoned the plain words of Scripture for the secular ideology of the Enlightenment.|$|E
6000|$|This brief {{review of}} Greek divine myths does not of course aim at {{exhausting}} the subject. We do not pretend to examine the legends of all the Olympians. But enough has been said to illustrate the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and to give specimens of the method at work. It has been seen {{that there is only}} agreement among philologists as to the origin and meaning of two out of nearly a dozen divine names. Zeus is admitted to be connected with Dyaus, and to have originally meant [...] "sky". Demeter is accepted as Greek, with the significance of [...] "Mother Earth". But the meaning and the roots of Athene, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Cronus, Aphrodite, Dionysus--we might add Poseidon and Hephaestus--are very far from being known. Nor is there much more general agreement as to the original elemental phenomena or elemental province held by all of these gods and goddesses. The moon, the wind, the twilight, the sun, the growth and force of vegetation, the dark, the night, the atmosphere, have been shuffled and dealt most variously to the various deities by learned students of myth. This complete diversity of opinion must be accepted as a part in the study.|$|E

Professor Roth thinks the Asvins contain an historical element, and are [...] "the earliest bringers {{of light in the}} morning sky". Mr. Max Müller seems in favour of the two twilights. As to these and allied modes of explaining the two gods in connection with physical phenomena, Muir writes thus: [...] "This allegorical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> seems unlikely to be correct, as it is difficult to suppose that the phenomena in question should have been alluded to under such a variety of names and circumstances. It appears, therefore, to be more probable that the Rishis merely refer to certain legends which were popularly current of interventions of the Asvins in behalf of the persons whose names are mentioned." [...] In the Veda* the Asvins are represented as living in fraternal polyandry, with but one wife, Surya, the daughter of the sun, between them. They are thought to have won her as the prize in a chariot-race, according to the commentator Sayana. [...] "The time of their appearance is properly the early dawn," [...] when they receive the offerings of their votaries.** [...] "When the dark (night) stands among the tawny cows, I invoke you, Asvins, sons of the sky."*** They are addressed as young, beautiful, fleet, and the foes of evil spirits.|$|E

Yet even in Greek myth the beast is not wholly cast out, and Hellas by no means [...] "let the ape and tiger die".

That Mr. Maurice is more reverent, by being more accurate, more spiritual, by being more practical, in his interpretation than commentators on this book have usually been, will be seen the more the book is studied, and found to be what any and every commentary on the Revelation ought to be--a mine of political wisdom. Sayings will be found which will escape the grasp of most readers, as indeed they do mine, so pregnant are they, and swift revealing, like the lightning-flash at night, a whole vision: but only for a moment's space. The reader may find also details of interpretation which are open to doubt; if so, he will remember that no man would have shrunk with more horror than Mr. Maurice from the assumption of infallibility. Meanwhile, that the author's manly confidence in the reasonableness of his method will be justified hereafter, I must hope, if the Book of Revelation is to remain, as God grant it may, the political text-book of the Christian Church.|$|E
