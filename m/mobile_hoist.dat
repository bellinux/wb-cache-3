40|$|The final {{thesis is}} focused on a project of a load bearing {{structure}} of a aircraft maintenance hangar that has a rectangular ground plan 60, 0 x 120, 0 m and includes suspended <b>mobile</b> <b>hoist</b> of loading capacity 5, 0 t. The object is situated in the airport area of Ostrava Mošnov. The task provides two versions of design. The first version consists of eleven traverse joining beams witch are distanced twelve meters from each other. The second version consists of thirteen traverse joining beams witch are distanced ten meters from each other. The thesis focuses on the load pressure of the steel construction, the main emphasis being placed on the single structural components and assembling components. The calculation meet the standards of ČSN EN...|$|E
40|$|The safety, {{usability}} {{and accessibility}} of hospital bathrooms are important requirements for both patients and assistant nurses. Most frequently noted {{the critical factors}} in rehabilitation wards, in determining optimal management of patients' motor impairments, are space and equipment adequacy. Moreover, a bathroom {{is an essential part}} of any living space, and as such, has the potential to greatly impact on the patient’s recovery process. Current regulations and universal design define criteria for the physical layout of hospital bathrooms. Nonetheless, their practical use often discloses inconsistencies with regard to space and equipment that may jeopardize safety and ergonomics of both patients and personnel. This study explores safety, usability and accessibility issues in hospital bathrooms with a participative ergonomic approach. 32 hospital bathrooms of an Italian rehabilitation ward were inspected according to space and furniture features, and their use was simulated by dependent and independent patients. Obstacles to independent use and assisted transfers were assessed by the patients and the assisting nurses by reports and by on-site observation of physical constraints. The most critical aspects in the bathrooms ’ layout involved space (26 % less than the recommended value), inaccessibility with devices (67 % with wheelchair, 90 % with <b>mobile</b> <b>hoist),</b> inadequate location and inconsistency of elements of hygiene. Inadequate space and missing elements create an unsafe environment which may damage both nurses an...|$|E
50|$|PIMEX is {{also used}} to {{visualize}} noise, heat stress, nanoparticles, electromagnetic fields and physical load. In the Netherlands there are also videos available that are made for employees in health services who are working with a <b>mobile</b> patient <b>hoist.</b> Such <b>mobile</b> <b>hoists</b> are used to reduce physical overload. The video shows the difference in exposure between using the hoist in the wrong and the correct way, for example when the wheels are in the wrong or right position.|$|R
40|$|Nursing {{personnel}} are consistently identified {{as one of}} the occupational groups most at risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. During the moving and handling of bariatric patients, the weight of the patient combined with atypical body mass contributes to a significant risk of injury to the care provider and patient. This is further compounded by the shape, mobility and co-operation of the patient. The aim of this study was determine user experiences and design requirements for <b>mobile</b> <b>hoists</b> with bariatric patients. Structured interviews were conducted with six experienced injury management staff from the Manual Task Services department of three hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. All staff had experience in patient handling, the use of patient handling equipment and the provision of patient handling training. A series of open-ended questions were structured around five main themes: 1) patient factors; 2) building/vehicle space and design; 3) equipment and furniture; 4) communication; and 5) staff issues. Questions focussed on the use of <b>mobile</b> <b>hoists</b> for lifting and transferring bariatric patients. Interviews were supplemented with a walk-through of the hospital to view the types of <b>mobile</b> <b>hoists</b> used, and the location and storage of equipment. Across the three hospitals there were differing classification systems to define bariatric patients. Ensuring patient dignity, respect and privacy were viewed as important in the management and rehabilitation of bariatric patients. Storage and space constraints were considered factors restricting the use of <b>mobile</b> floor <b>hoists,</b> with ceiling hoists being the preferred method for patient transfers. When using <b>mobile</b> floor <b>hoists,</b> the forces required to push, pull and manoeuvre, as well as sudden unstable movements of the hoist were considered important risks factors giving rise to a risk of injury to the care provider. Record keeping and purchasing policies appeared to inhibit the effective use of patient handling equipment. The moving and handling of bariatric patients presents complex and challenging issues. A co-ordinated and collaborative approach for moving and handling bariatric patients is needed across the range of care providers. Designers must consider both user and patient requirements. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{full-size}} replica {{steam locomotive}} GWR 3031 Class named The Queen was built at Steamtown, Carnforth, {{and this was}} combined with an ex-South Eastern and Chatham Railway tender and fittings from a GWR tender. The locomotive's bogie and rear wheels are also from another GWR tender, but the large driving wheels are only half complete (the lower half) {{and they do not}} sit directly on the rails. This allowed the locomotive to be rolled into position when the exhibition was built. The replica was completed in December 1982 and delivered by road in January 1983. Two <b>mobile</b> cranes <b>hoisted</b> it onto the viaduct, then it was rolled into position on temporary track. Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so that steam was emitted from the cab, whistles and safety valves, and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|R

The company was chosen as a business form. The existing divisions at the Memmingen site were retained and business there was continued as usual. This way, Stetter GmbH retained its own research and development department specifically for the products on the market, the personnel department and its own management.|$|R
5000|$|The {{offensive}} {{began on}} 7 June 1944 at 5 {{o'clock in the}} morning [...] with a bazooka shot on the security forces' barracks at Champ de Mars serving as the signal to begin the attack. By 6 o'clock, the buildings used to house the German garrison were identified; the post office and the town hall, where the FTP established there command posts, were secured by 7 o'clock. At 8 o'clock, the train station was also taken by the resistance, who found there only eighteen watchmen and one employee of the railway, Abel Leblanc: invited to join the Maquis, they decided instead to await the end of the fighting in the station waiting room. At 11:30, the forces of the Milice and the <b>Mobile</b> Reserve Group <b>hoisted</b> a white flag on the barracks of the Champs de Mars and, following negotiations, they left the town around 4:00 pm carrying all their gear. For Elie Dupuy, whose FTP battle group was not affected by the order to fall back to Chapou, this departure was a failure of one of the operation's goals of recovering war material and transport from the security forces; but with his single battalion of only 90 men, he could not afford [...] "to continue the attack against the German garrison, and at the same time, impose unconditional surrender on the security forces".|$|R
