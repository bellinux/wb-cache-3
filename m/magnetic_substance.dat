5000|$|A spin ice is a <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>substance</b> {{that does}} not have a single minimal-energy state. It has magnetic moments (i.e. [...] "spin") as elementary degrees of freedom which are subject to frustrated interactions.

Spin ices show low-temperature properties, residual entropy in particular, closely related to those of common crystalline water ice. The most prominent compounds with such properties are dysprosium titanate (Dy2Ti2O7) and holmium titanate (Ho2Ti2O7).
