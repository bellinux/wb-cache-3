50|$|Gradation {{can also}} be useful in {{composing}} photographs. The {{early decades of the}} development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: A major innovation was the development of halftone photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT), with a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. <b>Halftone</b> <b>screens</b> are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.|$|R
40|$|The <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> {{with fine}} {{vertical}} gratings {{is often used}} to modulate images in the printing technology. When the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> is disturbed by the jitter in horizontal direction we observe the lattice fringe (called banding) in the horizontal direction. Surprisingly, any frequency component does not exist in the spatial frequency domain of the banding. Also, the banding is detected even when the spatial frequency of the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> exceeds the frequency limit of the visual sensitivity, where the gratings (carrier) are the longitudinal waves of the horizontal direction and the jitter (side band) are transversal waves of the vertical direction. A doubly periodic function takes place above as etiology, and then higher harmonics occur. This complicates an argument. We validated the banding appearance by the carrier grating of the single frequency (69 cpd) and jitter (5. 2 cpd) as the side band that removed higher harmonics, to find a response curve by 2 AFC in experiment. The correlation between the response curve and the cross term of the jitter spectrum and grating spectrum is absolutely high. So the presence of the nonlinear response is indicated in the early stage. We applied a nonlinear function to the above stimulation to evaluate nonlinearity. As a result, we think the banding spectrum is generated by the configuration of nonlinearity and the spatial frequency characteristic in the early stage...|$|R

40|$|The {{halftone}} {{process has been}} the conventional means of reproducing photographic artwork on newsprint. The use of relatively coarse screen rulings, dictated by the paper characteristics, produces an image with a noticeable dot pattern. Furthermore, the printing process is susceptible to extreme dot gain variation, which affects tone reproduction and the pictorial communication of the image. There were good reasons to suspect that a random dot screen could give more consistent tone rendition than a conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> A comparative study of the consistency of perception of conventional and randomly screened images when printed on newsprint {{has not yet been}} reported. The present study is an attempt to determine which screen can reproduce more consistently perceptible images when extreme dot gain occurs. To test this comparison, an original black and white photographic image, composed of geometric shapes of varying densities superimposed on backgrounds of varying densities, was reproduced from a computer generated slide. This test target, designed to encourage objective answers from observers, was photographed through 65 -and 85 -line conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screens,</b> and 75 -and 150 - line mezzotint (random dot) screens. The production of film, plate, and the press run were the same for the four screened images. The pressman purposely varied the ink film thickness to simulate dot gain. Selected samples of minimum, average, and maximum dot gain were presented to observers, who were asked to identify geometric shapes on 12 printed images. The recorded responses were averaged, and the collected data was represented in graphs. In this manner it was possible to determine which screens can reproduce more consistent tonal distinctions. The results of the experiment proved that the random dot screens are not capable of reproducing more consistently perceptible images. The 65 -line conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> produces more consistent perceptual responses in the highlights, while the 85 -line conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> produces more consistent responses in the midtones...|$|R

In the historic evolution of printed images, photographic <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> were used to render the illusion of gray scale with binary (black ink on white paper) printers.

In this paper, a novel total least square (TLS) regression technique is proposed for the model parameter estimation problem for dot-on-dot screen printers. Compared to the traditional least square (LS) approach, the TLS method is physically more appropriate because it accounts for errors in both the measured reflectance of the selected primaries and the modeled reflectance. At the same time, TLS provides increased mathematical flexibility in fitting the Neugebauer model to the experiment data.

Then, based on these results, we focus on the moiré phenomenon from a different angle, the dynamic point of view: we introduce the moiré parameter space, and show how changes in the parameters of the superposed layers vary the moiré patterns in the superposition.

Micro-channel spatial light modulators are modified via the Fabry-Perot method to achieve the high gamma operation required for non-linear operation. Real-time nonlinear processing was performed using the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> and MSLM.

The Hughes LCLV has been characterized and found to yield high gamma (about 1. 7) when operated in low frequency and low bias mode. Cascading of two LCLVs should also provide enough gamma for nonlinear processing. In this case, the SBP of the LCLV is sufficient but the uniformity of the LCLV needs improvement. These include image correlation, computer generation of holograms, pseudo-color image encoding for image enhancement, and associative-retrieval in neural processing.

In the proposed algorithm we can control this hardness directly. Another novelty is that the framework isn't limited to the classical orthonormal AM halftoning grids.

40|$|Due to some {{inherent}} advantages, rotated dot screens are {{the most}} common halftoning method. The color re-production of rotated dot schemes is more robust with respect to mis-registration errors than color reproduc-tion using other halftoning schemes (e. g., dot-on-dot or dot-off-dot). In order to achieve good overall print qual-ity, however, the angles between the different color sepa-rations have to be precisely controlled, or moiré will occur. This precise control of the screen angles is gener-ally not possible in digital systems with their inherent discrete resolution. At the high resolutions commonly used in offset printing (e. g., ≥ 2400 × 2400 dpi), the dis-crete nature of the screen is normally not a critical is-sue. The problem persists, however, at resolutions commonly found in xerographic printers. Because moiré is a strong function of the relative screen angles, especially of the c,m,k separations, many approaches have been explored for mitigating moiré pat-terns via <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> and screen angle design. How-ever, as will be shown in this paper, moiré is also a strong function of the geometry of the individual halftone dot, specifically the dot area coverage of the halftone dot. It is this dependence that is described and exploited in this paper. More specifically, a method is described that reduces the c,m,k moiré by using a variable undercolor removal (UCR) and gray component replacement (GCR) scheme for a given <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> Preliminary work was published in a conference proceeding. 10 This article is a more detailed and complete description of the work. Modeling Moiré In Color Printing The effect of moiré in color printing has long been known and has led to the common color layout of using cyan and magenta at plus and minus 15 °, black, or key, at 45 ° and yellow at 0 °. In this scenario, cyan, magenta and black use the identical screen frequencies. In this way, the interaction, or moiré, between cyan and ma-genta has identical frequency and orientation as the black separation. The result is a zero frequency moir...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} lithography, a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> {{is used to}} photographically {{convert the}} continuous- tone image of the original into a grid of very small, closely spaced dots of constant density but varying areas. Screenless or continuous-tone lithography is a printing process capable of reproducing images with gradated tones {{without the use of}} a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> Screenless lithography has a high quality potential because it has few of the inherent problems that limit the quality of the halftone process. This thesis investigates the image mechanisms in screenless lithography and in particular the role of variable water receptivity. It was hypothesized that in screenless lithography which uses a particular image carrier known as the Association Products plate, the continuous-tone image is due to selective emulsification of the ink resulting in a varying ink layer thickness and therefore varying densities. It was theorized that the plate has a water receptivity which varies with exposure to light and that this results in varying degrees of water-in-ink emulsification when the plate is dampened and inked. When transferred to paper and dried this results in an ink layer of varying thickness, which in turn causes a variation in optical density. A mathematical relationship was developed relating optical density, percentage of emulsified water, and ink layer thickness. This relationship allowed prediction of the amount of water-in-ink emulsification necessary to produce a given density range and a prediction of the amount of emulsification expected on a given plate area associated with a particular printed density. Testing proved that these predicted values were not present in actual printing from the plates. It was concluded that the hypothesis is invalid...|$|R

In the graphic arts, the term moiré means an excessively visible moiré pattern.

40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening,</b> (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled <b>halftone</b> <b>screens.</b> High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled <b>halftone</b> <b>screens,</b> each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|R
