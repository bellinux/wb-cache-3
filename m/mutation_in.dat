5|$|Familial {{prion disease}} occurs in {{families}} with a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented. These mice can then transmit {{the disease to}} healthy, wild type mice, suggesting that mice with PrP mutations spontaneously generate infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the genes regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
5|$|The yellow <b>{{mutation}}</b> <b>in</b> {{fruit flies}} is a mutation causing a congenital lack of normal pigment; it {{is a similar}} phenomenon to albinism in other organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Humans have {{a number}} of {{voltage-gated}} chloride channel genes, and <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> the CBS domains of several of these have been identified as the cause of genetic diseases. <b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> CLCN1 lead to myotonia (...) , <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> CLCN2 can lead to idiopathic generalised epilepsy (...) , <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> CLCN5 can lead to Dent's disease (...) , <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> CLCN7 can lead to osteopetrosis (...) , and <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> CLCNKB can lead to Bartter syndrome (...)

50|$|<b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> SMN1 are {{associated}} with spinal muscular atrophy. <b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> SMN2 alone do not lead to disease, although <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> both SMN1 and SMN2 result in embryonic death.|$|R
50|$|Any one {{of several}} <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> {{hepcidin}} result in juvenile hemochromatosis. The majority of juvenile hemochromatosis cases are due to <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> hemojuvelin. <b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> TMPRSS6 can cause anemia through dysregulation of Hepcidin.|$|R
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> receptors {{that result}} in {{increased}} constitutive activity underlie some inherited diseases, such as precocious puberty (due to <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> luteinizing hormone receptors) and hyperthyroidism (due to <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors).|$|R
50|$|<b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> 7DHCR {{are linked}} to Smith-Lemli-Opitz {{syndrome}} (SLOS). <b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> NPC1 {{have been shown to}} cause Niemann-Pick disease, type C. <b>Mutations</b> <b>in</b> patched are associated with a variety of cancers (basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).|$|R
30|$|Most {{mutations}} {{were found}} within the elderly population. Thirteen percent <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> patients older than 70 years, 10 % <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> patients age between 60 and 70 years and 9 % activating <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> patients younger than 60 years.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> a gene on the X chromosome. A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E
40|$|Constitutional {{heterozygous}} inactivating <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF 2) tumor {{suppressor gene}} cause the autosomal dominant disease NF 2, and biallelic inactivating somatic NF 2 <b>mutations</b> are found <b>in</b> {{a high proportion of}} unilateral sporadic vestibular schwannoma (USVS) and sporadic meningioma. We surveyed the distributions of constitutional NF 2 <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> 823 NF 2 families, 278 somatic NF 2 <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> USVS, and 208 somatic NF 2 <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> sporadic meningioma. Based on the available NF 2 mutation data, the most dominant influence on the spectra of <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> exons 1 - 15 are C>T transitions that change arginine codons (CGA) to stop codons (TGA) due to spontaneous deamination of methylcytosine to thymine in CpG dinucleotides.

40|$|RUNX 1 is a recurrently {{mutated gene}} in {{sporadic}} myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. Inherited <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> RUNX 1 cause familial platelet disorder with predisposition to {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (FPD/AML). <b>In</b> sporadic AML, <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> RUNX 1 are usually secondary events, whereas in FPD/AML they are initiating events. Here we will describe <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> RUNX 1 in sporadic AML and in FPD/AML, discuss the mechanisms by which inherited <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> RUNX 1 could elevate the risk of AML in FPD/AML individuals, and speculate on why <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> RUNX 1 are rarely, if ever, the first event in sporadic AML...|$|R
5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} {{radiation}} {{is one of the}} causes of genetic <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E

5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E
