500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going to be telling this season on the show we expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E

6000|$|From {{about this}} time until 1885 Mr. Henley acted in an {{informal}} way [...] as agent for R. L. S. in most of his dealings with publishers in [...] London. [...] "Both" [...] in the second paragraph <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Treasure [...] Island and Silverado Squatters.|$|R
2500|$|We were {{surprised}} to see it become as big--I mean, the story became way bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was just about that circumstance. For us, none {{of us have a}} real strong position against people sharing music. I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's fine. We didn't feel like we were getting ripped off or anything. Everything else related to it, between that writer and his boss..... Whatever else happened, I feel like we're out of it.|$|E
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we discussed singing for half a second, {{and then it just}} kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to me. Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E

2500|$|Eastwood {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by saying the film was about the American dream. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, [...] "I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a [...]44 Magnum. But that doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's a proper thing to do". Roger Ebert stated that [...] "a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. Million Dollar Baby is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact".|$|E

60|$|As to {{the blunt}} {{decorated}} slate weapons, the forger did not <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> to pass off these as practicable {{arms of the}} Neolithic period.

What he intended to dump down were not practical weapons, but, in one case at least, armes d'apparat, as French archaeologists call them, weapons of show or ceremony.|$|E

6000|$|... "In that case," [...] was her quick reply, [...] "why is Mr. Cragg still writing {{scores of}} letters and getting bags full of replies?

6000|$|She paused. The calm smile lighted up {{her face}} once more. Then she drew out a pencil. [...] "You think life must lack plot-interest for me," [...] she began, slowly, [...] "because, with certain natures, I can {{partially}} guess beforehand what is coming. But {{have you not}} observed that, in reading a novel, part of the pleasure you feel arises from your conscious anticipation of the end, and your satisfaction in seeing that you anticipated correctly? Or part, sometimes, from the occasional unexpectedness of the real denouement? Well, life is like that. I enjoy observing my successes, and, in a way, my failures. Let {{me show you what}} I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I know what you said to Sebastian--not the words, of course, but the purport; and I will write it down now for you. Set down YOUR version, too. And then we will compare them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{rest of the}} day {{and evening}} passed quietly enough. The Count and I played at chess. For the first two games he politely allowed me to conquer him, and then, when he saw that I had found him out, begged my pardon, and at the third game checkmated me in ten minutes. Sir Percival never once referred, all through the evening, to the lawyer's visit. But either that event, or {{something}} else, had produced a singular alteration for the better in him. He was as polite and agreeable to all of us, as he {{used to be in the}} days of his probation at Limmeridge, and he was so amazingly attentive and kind to his wife, that even icy Madame Fosco was roused into looking at him with a grave surprise. What does this <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can guess--I am afraid Laura can guess--and I am sure Count Fosco knows. I caught Sir Percival looking at him for approval more than once in the course of the evening.|$|E

50|$|From 1965 to 1972, Fradon left comics {{to raise}} her daughter. In 1972, she {{returned}} to DC where later in the decade she would draw Plastic Man, Freedom Fighters, and Super Friends which she penciled for almost its entire run. She also worked for Marvel Comics during this period, but left after only two assignments: a fill-in issue of Fantastic Four and the never-published fifth issue of The Cat. Fradon recounted: First of all, I was really rusty. And The Cat I was totally confounded by not drawing from a script. They gave me this one paragraph and said go draw this 17-page story. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> did my best work by any <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had a script on Fantastic Four, but <b>I</b> just don’t <b>think</b> they were satisfied with my work.
