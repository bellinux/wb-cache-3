40|$|This paper investigates how Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd (Telecom) managed its {{legitimacy}} after announcing the Chief Executive Officer’s (CEO’s) pay in 2009 {{as well as}} the <b>media’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>public’s</b> reaction to Telecom’s announcement. The findings show that Telecom, the <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the <b>public</b> use the same remuneration logics to justify their positions. These remuneration logics are used to both justify and criticise Telecom’s CEO’s pay, although the <b>media’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>public’s</b> arguments are often unsophisticated and focus on the absolute level of CEO pay. Telecom is able to maintain {{its legitimacy}} through the use of well-structured, sophisticated arguments...|$|R

50|$|If the <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the <b>public</b> knows {{everything}} that happens in all authorities and county administrations {{there will be a}} lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the <b>public.</b> People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the <b>public.</b> One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is freedom of information legislation and requests. Modern democracy builds on such participation of the people <b>and</b> <b>media.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tomlinson's death {{sparked a}} debate in the UK about the {{relationship}} between the police, <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>public,</b> and the independence of the IPCC.

5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> expressed confusion and criticism over {{various aspects of the}} incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E

5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from Ostend was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
