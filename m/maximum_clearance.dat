25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the rake, with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the rake exceeds the <b>maximum</b> <b>clearance</b> height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|E

50|$|In November 1972, Moses, the {{recently}} created New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), and the MTA submitted {{the environmental impact}} statement (EIS) for the bridge. The statement specified that the project was to include the approaches to the bridge (I-287 and NY 135) and be a 16.5 mi project, as that was {{the distance from the}} interchange of I-287 and I-95 in Rye to the interchange of NY 135 and NY 25 in Syosset. The statement also explained how the highway would become an extended part of I-287. The bridge was to be constructed with four lanes, about 135 ft above the sound at <b>maximum</b> <b>clearances</b> and 55 ft on the minimum clearances. There would be 1200 ft of a center between the two towers along the cable span. These minimums reported by the two authorities and Moses were equal to those of the bridges crossing the East River in New York City. The main span would have a median divider separating the directional lanes, along with a girder box to allow for smooth passing.|$|R

For that objective, the prescribed motion of the biped is completely characterised in terms of five locomotions variables: step lenght, hip height, maximum hip ripple, <b>maximum</b> foot <b>clearance</b> and link lengths. In this work we propose four methods to quantitatively measure the performance of the walking robot: energy analysis, perturbation analysis, lowpass frequancy response and locomobility measure.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of microalgal species and food concentration on various physiological parameters and Scope for Growth (SFG) in adults of 2 pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and P. <b>maxima.</b> <b>Clearance</b> rate, pseudofaecal production rate, absorption efficiency, respiration rate and excretion rate were determined over a range of food concentrations using 2 microalgal diets, Tahitian Isochrysis sp. (T-Iso) and Dunaliella primolecta at 28 °C. Clearance, pseudofaecal production and respiration rates were significantly affected by microalgal diet. From these results, and because of the higher energy content of T-Iso, pearl oysters feeding on T-Iso had maximum values of SFG that were 1. 5 to 2. 1 times higher than when feeding on D. primolecta. Clearance rate and absorption efficiency were significantly related to food concentration as negative exponential relationships (p < 0. 001). Generally, pseudofaecal production, respiration and excretion rates were significantly related to food concentration as positive linear relationships (p < 0. 005). Optimal food concentrations for maximum SFG for P. margaritifera and P. maxima were 1 to 2 mg 1 - 1 and 2 to 3 mg l-¹, respectively. P. maxima was better adapted to a wider range of food concentrations. P. maxima maintained positive SFG up to 9 mg l-¹ food concentration when feeding on T-Iso and up to 7 mg l⁻¹ when feeding on D. primolecta, while equivalent values for P. margaritifera were 7 mg l⁻¹ and 5 mg l⁻¹, respectively. These results are in accordance with P. maxima occurring in a wider range of habitats than P. margaritifera, and experiencing greater concentration ranges of suspended particulate matter...|$|R
