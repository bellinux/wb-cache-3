500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E

The cliff tramway opened a year later and provided transport between the pier and the town. [...] The railway is water-balanced and since 1924 the water pump has been electrically operated. [...] The first major maintenance {{was carried out in}} 1998, when the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> wheel was replaced and a new braking system installed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the <b>main</b> <b>winding)</b> disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E

50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 electrical {{degrees to the}} <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> always centered directly between the poles of the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> and connected to the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the flux of the starting winding, causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a centrifugal switch or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the start circuit. In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the start circuit is permanently connected to the <b>main</b> <b>winding,</b> with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|E

50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} start motor. It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|E
50|$|The Bullhead has its {{nickname}} {{due to the}} <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> crown {{being located}} at 12 o’clock and the chronograph pushers being located either side. The watch was also unique in design as the case was much thicker at the top than the bottom meaning the watch sat higher on the wrist at 12 o’clock than it did at six o’clock.|$|E
50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the start winding and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other split-phase motors, the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> is used with a smaller start winding, and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> and the start circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a speed sensitive centrifugal switch requires that other split-phase motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the start winding is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|E

50|$|A {{transductor}} (not to {{be confused}} with a transducer) is type of magnetic amplifier used in power systems for compensating reactive power. It consists of an iron-cored inductor with two windings - a <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> through which an alternating current flows from the power system, and a secondary control winding which carries a small direct current. By varying the direct current, the iron core of the transductor can be arranged to saturate at different levels and thus vary the amount of reactive power absorbed.|$|E
50|$|In 1888, {{production}} {{had increased}} {{to such an}} extent that the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> shaft had reached its maximum capacity. The upcast shaft was then fitted out for coal winding and output continued to climb. By 1890, with output averaging 1000 tons per day, the underground haulage of coal from the North dip workings by ponies had become unsustainable and a 60HP electrically driven underground rope-haulage system - the first of its kind in the world - was installed near the downcast pit bottom to haul coal up the 1 in 12 roadway from the North workings. During the next seven years, a further four electrically driven rope haulages were installed, freeing up 44 horses and raising output to 1700 tons per day.|$|E

A rope would {{be attached to the}} loaded top cradle and it would be drawn out of the water {{to the top of the}} incline using a small winding drum driven by a steam engine. The main incline rope would then be attached to the cradle and the loaded boat would descend the incline, counterbalanced by an empty boat ascending on the other rail line. The speed would be controlled by a brake on the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> drum. On reaching the summit a rope from the small winding drum would be attached to the cradle to control its descent into the upper basin.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{single phase}} motors are {{split-phase}} motors {{and have a}} second stator winding fed with out-of-phase current; such currents may be created by feeding the winding through a capacitor or having it receive different values of inductance and resistance from the <b>main</b> <b>winding.</b> In capacitor-start designs, the second winding is disconnected once the motor is up to speed, usually either by a centrifugal switch acting on weights on the motor shaft or a thermistor which heats up and increases its resistance, reducing the current through the second winding to an insignificant level. The capacitor-run designs keep the second winding on when running, improving torque. A resistance start design uses a starter inserted in series with the startup winding, creating reactance.|$|E

5000|$|Monocyclic {{power was}} {{a name for}} an {{asymmetrical}} modified two-phase power system used by General Electric around 1897, championed by Charles Proteus Steinmetz and Elihu Thomson. This system was devised to avoid patent infringement. In this system, a generator was wound with a full-voltage single-phase winding intended for lighting loads and with a small fraction (usually 1/4 of the line voltage) winding that produced a voltage in quadrature with the main windings. The intention was to use this [...] "power wire" [...] additional winding to provide starting torque for induction motors, with the <b>main</b> <b>winding</b> providing power for lighting loads. After the expiration of the Westinghouse patents on symmetrical two-phase and three-phase power distribution systems, the monocyclic system fell out of use; {{it was difficult to}} analyze and did not last long enough for satisfactory energy metering to be developed.|$|E

40|$|Making {{the simple}} model {{test of the}} full circle typed sprinkler, I found that the {{phenomenon}} of the high distribution parts took place at right angles to the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction passing through the nozzle at the wind speed of about 2 - 3 m/sec. In order to make this growth mechanism clear, I made a sprinkling test with a main nozzle which was the motive power of a sprinkler. Comparatively high distribution parts grew {{on both sides of the}} <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction passing through the nozzle at the wind speed of 1 m/sec and a horseshoe-shaped equal distribution line appeared in the sprinkler distribution chart. Besides the dent was found to be divided into two parts at right angles to the <b>main</b> <b>wind</b> direction, with the increase of the wind speed. Considering the sprinkler distribution chart of the main and the sub nozzles, their influences from the wind were proved to be canceled each other.

In view of the nozzle the jet water of the main nozzle was most effected by the wind, and the important factor of the growth of the high distribution parts. Carrying out the sprinkling test of right angle range with the part circle typed sprinkler which has never been experimented yet and especially examine the influence of the wind, I could make its characteristic clear. Next I carried out the experiment of this sprinkler together with the full circle typed one and proved that it secured a pretty good charactor of equality even at the wind of 3 m/sec as I mentioned above I studied the sprinkling characteristic of the sprinklers unlike in the quality of jet water and the type...|$|R
