40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{some ideas}} about the basic tasks of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> in the present situation when agrometeorologists must face some new challenges. The scope of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> as many other applied disciplines has changed during the last decades. While the basic task of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> has stayed the same, the socio-economic expectations of society have {{changed in the last}} decades. It seems that the stress has somehow shifted from the increasing of yield towards sustainable development in agriculture. There is also an additional problem in that the focus of agrometeorological activities varies from region to region. This poses problems to international organizations. The basic aim of “agrometeorology” is to improve the applications of meteorology to agriculture and environment in reference to crop management, groundwater contamination by fertilisers and pesticides, erosion, etc. This paper provides an overview of various European agrometeorological activities in relation to the conservation of natural and environmental resources...|$|R

Agrometeorologists {{all over the world are}} now able to take advantage of a wealth of observational data, product and services flowing from specially equipped and highly sophisticated environmental observation satellites. In addition, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology is becoming an essential tool for combining various map and satellite information sources in models that simulate the interactions of complex natural systems. The Commission for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Meteorology</b> of WMO has been active in the area of remote sensing and GIS applications in agrometeorology. The paper provides a brief overview of the satellite remote sensing and GIS Applications in <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> along with a description of the WMO Satellite Activities Programme.

It accounts for almost 1.53 % of India’s geographical area and 2.37 % of its population. It represents a unique example of a fast developing economy based on agriculture. Ludhiana, the hub of hosiery, the metropolitan centre of Punjab, has emerged as the most vibrant and important business centre. Positioned at 30 ° 56 ′N and 75 ° 52 ′E, Ludhiana is located about 10  km south of the Sutlej, one of the five major rivers of pre-independent Punjab. The Sutlej river and its tributary, a perennial stream, the Buddha Nallah originates near Chamkaur Sahib in Ropar district and enters Ludhiana city near village Bholapur. The Buddha Nallah drain flows through the city and is flooding stream during the monsoon season, which carries the domestic and industrial sewage of the city, finally merges into Sutlej River. The month of July is considered as the wettest month with an average of 90.8  mm of rainfall compared to the month of November, driest weather with an average of 0.0  mm of rainfall. This was concluded by analysing seasonal data recorded by Climate Change and <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Department, Punjab <b>Agricultural</b> University, Ludhiana.|$|R

Such data are also needed to assess the impacts of agricultural activities and processes on the environment and climate. The following sections provide guidance on the types of observations required, their extent, organization and accuracy, as well as on the instruments needed to obtain the data, with emphasis on those for operational and long-term stations.

40|$|Professor Stigter what in {{your view}} {{have been the most}} {{significant}} contributions that ICTs have made to the study and practice of agrometeorology? In agrometeorology, as in any other environmental science, modern ICTs have contributed to new and better knowledge and applications. Examples can be found in weather, climate and yield forecasting, risk assessments, monitoring and early warning systems. Governments are now {{in a better position to}} warn farmers to enable them to prepare for calamities, and to reduce and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters on agricultural production to the best of their abilities. Better meteorological services are directly serving farmers in developed countries and, to a lesser but increasing extent, better off farmers in developing countries. What are {{in your view}} the most urgent agricultural problems facing farmers in ACP countries? The majority of poor and marginal farmers are confronted with a number of urgent problems. They have to farm under conditions of increasing climate variability and change, and degrading soils. This applies to the users of grasslands and forage crops for livestock in Inner Mongolia, where I am working right now, and to dryland and irrigated farming in central Sudan, where I worked for 15 years. It also applies to small rice farmers in Indonesia as well as to the millet growers in northern Nigeria, where I worked for ten years on intercropping and on agroforestry systems to protect crops from dry winds. Many of these farmers also face markets that are biased against them, and governments that are unwilling or unable to assist. And when they do receive assistance, the measures are often too limited in scope, or are incompatible with their actual needs. They are also usually devised from the top down, addressing the symptoms, rather than tackling actual problems from the bottom up. Do you believe that research in agrometeorology can help to overcome some of these problems? In my view, making <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> more operational is not enough to help poor farmers. To provide effective agrometeorological services, we have to combine the adaptive strategies they have developed themselves using indigenous innovations and experience absorbed from elsewhere, with other sources of knowledge. These sources include contemporary scientific knowledge, as well as the understanding of socio-economic systems necessary to create appropriate policy environments. In the application of scientific knowledge, ICTs are among the most powerful supportive components. But agrometeorological services have to be communicated to farmers in a participatory approach. Can you give some examples of agrometeorological interventions in which ICTs and indigenous knowledge have been combined with some measure of success? I am afraid I have yet to see clear examples. When I was president of the Commission for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Meteorology</b> (CAgM) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in the 1990 s, we tried to collect examples world-wide, but found few successful cases involving poor or marginal farmers. To a certain extent, this may be due to the lack of documentation, limited access to the ´grey´ literature (such as unpublished theses), language barriers or other constraints. That is why we are now trying again to collect such information. In China, for example, we are currently setting up a project in which we will try to identify examples of successful agrometeorological services. This may teach us about ICT components as well. Given the rapid technological advances in agrometeorology, is there a widening knowledge gap between providers and end users? This knowledge gap is very real and only strong policies towards agrometeorological services can overcome it. I strongly believe that providing such training for the staff of intermediary organizations - including local weather services and extension services - can help to bridge the gap. How have ICTs contributed to your own work? I am an experimental physicist by training, and all physics-related ICTs have always fascinated me. In our African research projects we have made ample use of ICTs in order to better understand traditional technologies and other forms of local knowledge. Yet, I believe that we have to be vigilant that technology never becomes a goal in itself. ICTs can be extremely useful tools and we must make maximum use of them, but when it comes to the provision of agricultural services to poor and marginal producers, indigenous technologies and local innovations must be our starting point because they represent the existing limitations best. mailto:cjstigter@usa. net Kees Stigter is an agrometeorologist, specialised in dryland agrometeorology; agroforestry against desertification, and traditional techniques of microclimate improvement, particularly in Africa and Asia.
