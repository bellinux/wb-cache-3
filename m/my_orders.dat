500|$|Although Hesse was {{confident}} {{that he would be}} able to hold Gibraltar against the numerically superior Franco-Spanish force, he was undermined by political disputes between the Habsburg and English commanders. There was widespread resentment among the English marines that they had not been allowed to return with Rooke's fleet. There was a particularly poisonous relationship between the English Colonel of Marines Edward Fox and the Irish Colonel Henry Nugent, whom Hesse had appointed as Governor of Gibraltar. The two men had fought on opposite sides during the Irish campaign of William III; the Protestant Fox had gone on to serve Queen Anne, while the Catholic Nugent had joined the service of Charles of Austria. Hesse wrote that Fox was [...] "furious at being under <b>my</b> <b>orders</b> and at not being allowed to leave for England. His respect for the Governor I have appointed is even less.

[...] Instead, Cameron wrote a glowing letter of commendation to Cadet Meigs on December 15, 1861.|$|E
2500|$|The Waffen-SS did not {{probe the}} British Commonwealth front until the {{afternoon}} of 11 April. This included an encounter with Australian artillery positions on the main road; Captain Gordon Laybourne Smith of the 2/3rd Field Regiment later commented that the German commander had sent: [...] "In all his insolence ... trucks down the main road ... to within 3,000yards [...] of our infantry, and proceeded to debus [...] At first I could not believe it was an enemy, all had been so still and quiet.

While at Plymouth Captain Robert Corbet, a man notorious for his harsh discipline and, at times, tyrannical behaviour was appointed to a new ship, Africaine. The crew of Africaine at first refused to hear his commission, forcing the commander at Plymouth, Admiral William Young, to bring another ship alongside and run out her guns to prevent any mutinous actions. Buller was appointed to investigate the matter, and one day while sitting near Buller at table, Corbet was heard to remark 'The service will not be good for any thing until captains can flog their lieutenants if needful, as well as the ship's company; absolute power over all in the ship is the thing.' Buller replied 'Why then, admirals must in justice have the power of flogging captains - have a care, Corbet, and don't come under <b>my</b> <b>orders,</b> for I won't spare you!' ...|$|E
2500|$|The Alabama Legislature {{converted}} the university {{over to the}} military system on February 23, 1860.

[...] On April 3, 1865 Union Brigadier General John T. Croxton and 1500 cavalrymen approached Tuscaloosa with orders to destroy all targets of military value in the town. [...] On April 4 Croxton sent Colonel Thomas M. Johnston and two hundred men to burn the university. [...] In the midst of carrying out his orders, university faculty pleaded with Johnston to spare the Rotunda and its library. [...] Johnston sent a message via courier to Croxton, asking if he might spare the building. [...] Croxton replied “My orders leave me no discretion... <b>My</b> <b>orders</b> are to destroy all public buildings.” [...] By the time that his men had completed their orders only seven university buildings remained: the Gorgas House, President's Mansion, Observatory (not on the Quad), the Little Round House, and a few faculty residences.|$|E

[...] Despite the cold, soldiers were prohibited from wearing cloaks or blankets, as these might limit their movements on the battlefield.

2500|$|At {{one o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of April 2, 1865, my {{regiment}} broke camp near Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my ear and one in my left side and while removing the third line, a bullet shattered my right knee-joint, costing me, subsequently, the loss of my leg. Supporting myself on the abatis, I gave <b>my</b> <b>orders</b> to my men, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the enemy's works.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under {{me for a long time}} and he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow <b>my</b> <b>orders,</b> so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

He found the experience frustrating, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, [...] "I have had some trouble with some of the people.
