Molecular dynamics-based {{approach}} {{to study the}} anisotropic self-diffusion of molecules in porous materials with <b>multiple</b> <b>cage</b> types: Application to H- 2 in losod. Journal of physical chemistry b, 110 (1), 501 - 506. RAE 2008 The anisotropic self-diffusion of molecular hydrogen in the <b>multiple</b> <b>cage</b> clathrasil losod (LOS) is modeled by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of up to 1 ?s for the temperature range 900 ? 1200 K while treating the framework as fully flexible. The LOS diffusion tensor is calculated employing an analytical method based on hopping rates. The diffusion in the c-direction of the unit cell {{is found to be}} approximately two times more rapid than in the a- and the b-directions, a characteristic of importance for the application of LOS as a membrane. The overall diffusion is based on five different hop types for which the individual hopping rates and diffusion barriers are calculated separately. We show explicitly that the shape and volume of the cages {{have a significant effect on}} the hopping rates and further that even small deformations of the circular Si 6 O 6 apertures have a large influence on the energetic barrier for hydrogen diffusion. Compared to the single cage clathrasils dodecasil 3 C (MTN) and sodalite (SOD), LOS has a lower diffusion rate. However, from a technical point of view this rate (at 573 K) is still fast enough for LOS to be interesting as a size-selective membrane or as a hydrogen-adsorption medium. Peer reviewe...|$|E

MPV DNA was detected in all cages in all locations on PID 7 and 14 but only below the bedding on PID 21. Swabbing below the bedding detected MPV in most cages through PID 42. Sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 but not on PID 21 seroconverted. MPV was detected in feces from all cages until PID 33 and in at least 1 cage until PID 56. In BALB/c mice, MPV was detected in feces and on cage swabs on PID 5 to 14, and 80 % of sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 seroconverted. In comparison, MPV infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice was detected in feces on PID 5 to 14 and on swabs on PID 5 and 7, and 30 % of sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 seroconverted.

A prospective, single blinded, randomized study was performed to evaluate {{the effect of a}} minimal invasive technique to obtain autologous bone from the iliac crest on pain.

Consecutive patients scheduled for cervical anterior discectomy with a fusion using a cage were randomly assigned either to the classical open group or the needle group. Patients were unaware of the two possible options for obtaining autologous bone. They were asked to fill in visual analogue scores (VASs) at fixed moments during the first 6 weeks postoperatively. Three VASs were recorded: the score at the moment, the minimal score and the maximal score during the last 24 h. The wound at the iliac crest was measured 6 weeks postoperatively. Complications were registered. Fifty patients were enrolled. Twenty-five patients were assigned to each group. The pain scores from the needle group were significantly less than from the open group.

Cross-validation showed that the use of cage sums led to better predictions of missing phenotypes compared with the approximate method.

40|$|Hydrogen {{clathrates}} {{have recently}} been discovered and considered as storage medium for H 2.

The goal of this work has been to develop a polarizable force field for use in molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen clathrates. The resulting force field has been coded in the DLPOLY package and simulations of the system as a function of the number of guest hydrogen molecules have been performed. The development of the force field, and the results of the simulations are discussed. In order for a clathrate structure to form, a 'guest' molecule must be present under ideal conditions. That is, water does not form a so-called 'self' hydrate. In order to elucidate the factors responsible for clathrate formation, emph{ab initio} calculations were performed on (H 2 O) $_{ 21 }$ and (H 2 O) $_{ 20 }$*H 2 S clusters. The results of these calculations have provided insight into why water does not form a self hydrate.
