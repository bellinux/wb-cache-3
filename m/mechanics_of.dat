5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Some critics praised Cow Clicker for its {{dissection}} of {{the common}} <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay, the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> which influenced titles by other developers. Joust {{was followed by}} a sequel four years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.|$|E

5|$|A Game Boy {{sequel to}} Kid Icarus, titled , was {{released}} in North America in November 1991, and in Europe on May 21, 1992. It was developed by Nintendo {{in cooperation with the}} independent company Tose, and largely adopts the gameplay <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> its predecessor. Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters remained the last installment in the series for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E

5|$|Cheng {{related in}} an {{interview}} that Don't Starves development taught Klei a considerable amount {{about the nature of the}} emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open and random world; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games. These lessons would later be used to balance the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> Klei's upcoming project Invisible, Inc.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{university}} in June 1913, Wilkinson became a paid worker for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, {{when more than}} 50,000 women marched {{from all over the}} country to a mass rally in Hyde Park, London. She began to develop a fuller understanding of the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> politics and campaigning, and became an accomplished speaker, able to hold her own even in the most hostile public meetings.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> {{the original}} game remain the same. The player controls an empire {{with the goal}} of conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the {{role-playing}} game {{system were}} created specifically for Bunnies & Burrows, common {{at the time}} of its original publishing. It features eight abilities and eight classes. The task resolution system is based on rolls of percentile dice. Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in Bunnies & Burrows created the framework for modern role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|While at Penn State, Voight had a joint {{affiliation}} with the school's Department of Mineral Engineering and taught courses in physical geology, <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> geological materials, and volcanology. During his career, he also lectured as a guest professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1972, working under Jacques Dozy, {{and served as a}} visiting professor at the University of Toronto in 1973 and at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1981. Still an emeritus professor at Penn State, he initiated an endowment under his name to contribute to the education of volcanic hazard specialists from developing countries.|$|E
