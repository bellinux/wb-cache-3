6000|$|... "Come, Rick, come! I must {{settle this}} before I sleep. How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you? How could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it's due east--must be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Rose," [...] said Septimius, [...] "she has doubtless gone to sleep, {{and will}} awake {{as well as}} usual. It would displease her <b>much</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> to miss your {{afternoon}} school; so you had better set the table with whatever there is left of yesterday's dinner, and leave me {{to take care of}} auntie." ...|$|R
6000|$|So, drawing {{comfortable}} breath again, You weigh and find, whatever {{more or less}} I {{boast of}} my ideal realized [...] 80 Is nothing in the balance when opposed To your ideal, your grand simple life, Of which you will not realize one jot.

6000|$|Winston {{shook his}} head. [...] "Russia {{can give them}} nothing. There was a failure in the Indian monsoon, and South American crops were small. Now, I am {{going to take a}} further liberty. How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> short?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take the}} figures for granted. Life {{is too short}} to worry over them," [...] the rancher said. [...] "Let's get down to business. How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> asking, no cure no pay, I finding tools and material? I want your bottom price {{straight}} away." ...|$|E

'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I {{had no idea that}} you could, either: you're not <b>much,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> Linton? Don't let me go home {{thinking}} I've done you harm. Answer! speak to me.' ...|$|E

[...] "Well, now, my good fellow, what's the damage, {{as they say in}} Kentucky; in short, what's to be paid out for this business? How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to cheat me, now?

6000|$|... "Tim," [...] he says, [...] "where can we sit down? How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{getting out}} of this? Brush and Jake Botcher are bidding high down-stairs, and the {{quotation}} on delegates has gone up ten points in ten minutes.

6000|$|It so chanced {{that the}} medical {{practitioner}} of the district {{was a man of}} large experience, of military training, and plain speech. When, therefore, he one day found in his surgery a man of rude Western type, strong-limbed and sunburned, but trembling, hesitating and neurotic in movement, after listening to his symptoms gravely, he asked, abruptly: [...] "And how <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> drinking now?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Are you ready, friend Cap?" [...] he asked. [...] "The heat {{begins to}} strike through the crevices; and {{although}} these green logs {{are not of}} the fiery natur' of an ill-tempered man, they may be kindled into a blaze if one provokes them too <b>much.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> ready with the barrel?

6000|$|And as for you, Doctor Reynolds, {{and your}} sociates, how <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> [...] bound to his Majestie's clemencye, {{permitting}} you {{contrary to the}} [...] statute 'primo Elizabethae', so freely to speak against the liturgie [...] and discipline established. Faine would I know the end you aime at, [...] and whether you be not of Mr. Cartwright's minde, who affirmed, that [...] we ought in ceremonies rather to conforme to the Turks than to the [...] Papists.

"Then {{is there}} more cunning in your schools than I had thought, for it is a certain method of showing them their vanity," [...] {{returned}} the trapper, suddenly abandoning a discussion, from which the naturalist {{was just beginning to}} anticipate great delight, by turning to his dog, whose restlessness he attempted to appease by playing with his ears. [...] "This is foolish, Hector; more like an untrained pup than a sensible hound; one who has got his education by hard experience, and not by nosing over the trails of other dogs, as a boy in the settlements follows on the track of his masters, be it right or be it wrong. Well, friend; you who can do so <b>much,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> equal to looking into the thicket? or must I go in myself?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Swope left Harvard at {{the start}} of World War II to work for the Hydrographic office at MIT. In her Oral History, she says, [...] "...they said, 'How <b>much</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> getting Harvard?' And I said, I think, $2000. That’s what they say they would pay me, what I was getting, but that was too little for them. They couldn't. So I rose fairly quickly." [...] During the war, 1942-1947, she worked on the LORAN {{navigation}} tables.|$|R

6000|$|During {{the thirty}} days that these Japonians were in retirement, {{it is not}} to be expressed, what {{celestial}} illuminations, what holy thoughts, what interior delights, the Holy Spirit infused into them. Anger could speak of nothing but of God; and spoke of Him with so much fervency, that it seemed even to burn him up. The mystery of the passion moved him above all the rest; and he was so ravished with the goodness of God, so possessed with love, in considering a God crucified, that he breathed nothing but martyrdom, and the salvation of his brethren. So that he was often heard to cry out, {{in the midst of his}} devotions, [...] "How glad should I be to die for thee, O my God! O my dear Japonians, how <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to be lamented, and what compassion do you raise in me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I walked {{about two}} or three miles, and then I met a plain countryman, who was busy about some {{husbandry}} work, I did not know what, and I asked him a great many questions first, not much to the purpose, but at last told him I was going for London, and the coach was full, and I could not get a passage, and asked him if he could tell me where to hire a horse that would carry double, and an honest man to ride before me to Colchester, that so I might get a place there in the coaches. The honest clown looked earnestly at me, and said nothing for above half a minute, when, scratching his poll, 'A horse, say you and to Colchester, to carry double? why yes, mistress, alack-a-day, you may have horses enough for money.' 'Well, friend,' says I, 'that I take for granted; I don't expect it without money.' 'Why, but, mistress,' says he, 'how <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> willing to give?' 'Nay,' says I again, 'friend, I don't know what your rates are in the country here, for I am a stranger; but if you can get one for me, get it as cheap as you can, and I'll give you somewhat for your pains.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That will do,' she said; 'I {{should say}} that will do first-rate. When I was a young 'un I often peeped in at the doors of big public-houses. I used to think the women behind the bars had a fine time of it. I should not think so now--at least, not in a big town--but in places like those you talk of, it would be {{different}} altogether. I should like the journey, too; it would be like going with gipsies, which I used to think would be the happiest life in the world. I was afraid when we got out here you would be wanting to do another thing like the last, and I would not have helped you--at any rate, not till we were getting down to our last shilling. But I like the thought of this, and I will do my best for you. I suppose they are a rough wild lot out there, but I think I can take care of myself. But this time, mind, I shall want a share; I am not going to work for years and then be thrown over when it suits you. I will have my share of the profits paid over to me once a week or once a month at the outside, and will put it away where I like. How <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to put into this thing?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{had used}} up mine, and the grandfathers', and the uncles', {{and began to}} think we might look a little further a-field," [...] said Dr. May. [...] "If I had only known where <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> I would have asked <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> the varlet's godfather; but I <b>was</b> <b>much</b> afraid <b>you</b> <b>were</b> nowhere {{in the land of}} the living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so--so we have," [...] added Tom, {{with more}} of a grin than ever. [...] "By the way, Dick, how <b>much</b> longer <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to linger before you scrape up money enough to pay the minister's fee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the Saints! you'll be tonsured next, and ill enough {{it would}} suit you," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Remember, if things grow too--difficult, {{you can always}} be tonsured, Olaf. Only then {{you will have to}} give up the hope of that lady who wears {{the other half of the}} {{necklace}} somewhere. I don't mean Irene's sham half, but the real one. Oh! stop blushing and stammering, I know the story, and all about Iduna the Fair also. An exalted person told it me, and so did you, although you were not aware that you had done so, for you are not one who can keep a secret to himself. May all the guardian angels help that necklace-lady if ever she should meet another lady whom I will not name. And now why do you talk so <b>much?</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> learning to preach, or what? If you really do mean to become a monk, Olaf, there is another thing you must give up, and that is war, except of the kind which you saw at the Council the other day. God above us! what a sight it would be to see you battering another bishop with a hook-shaped staff over a question of images or the Two Natures. I should be sorry for that bishop. But you haven't told me who converted you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that is {{only the}} first part; the second part is more interesting. Some time after this a peddler came by one day and stopped to show his things to the boys, several of whom bought pocket-combs, jew's-harps, and various trifles of that sort. Among the knives was a little white-handled {{penknife}} that Lewis wanted very much, but he had spent all his pocket-money, and no one had any to lend him. He held the knife in his hand, admiring and longing for it, till the man packed up his goods to go, then he reluctantly laid it down, and the man went on his way. The next day, however, the peddler returned to say that he could not find that very knife, and thought he must have left it at Miss Crane's. It was a very nice one with a pearl handle, and he could not afford to lose it. Every one looked, and every one declared they knew nothing about it. 'This young gentleman had it last, and seemed to want it very <b>much.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> quite sure you put it back?' said the man to Lewis, who was much troubled at the loss, and vowed {{over and over again that}} he did return it. His denials seemed to do no good, however, for every one was sure he had taken it, and after a stormy scene Miss Crane paid for it, and the man went grumbling away." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{what can}} you learn from this? Learn this, that in Christ you are safe, out of Christ you are lost. But REALLY in Christ, I mean-- not like the dead and dying grains, mildewed and worm-eaten, which you find here and there on the finest wheat-plant. Their end is to be burned, and so will ours be, for all our {{springing}} out of Christ's root, if the angel reapers find us not good wheat, but chaff and mildew. Every branch in Christ which beareth not fruit, His heavenly Father taketh away. Therefore, never pride yourself on having been baptised into Christ, never pride yourself on shewing some signs of God's Spirit, on being really good, right in this and right in that,--the question is, not so <b>much,</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> IN CHRIST at all, are you part of His tree, a member of His body? but, Are you ripening there? If you are not ripening, you are decaying, and your end will be as God has said. And {{do you wish to}} know whether you are in Christ, safe, ripening? see whether you are like Him. If the young grain does not shew like the seed grain, you may be sure it is making no progress; and as surely as a wheat-plant never brought forth rye, or a grape-tree thistles, so surely, if you are not like Christ in your character, in patience, in meekness, in courage, truth, purity, piety, and love, you may be of His planting, but you are none of His ripening, and you will not be raised with Him at the last day, to flower anew in the gardens of Paradise, world without end.|$|E
