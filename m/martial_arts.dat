This was a great influence on Ueshiba's <b>martial</b> <b>arts</b> philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{dissertation}} covers two intangible cultural practices of the Chinese traditions: <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> and bone setting. The research {{will be on the}} combination of these two practices in the context of Hong Kong. 　　　<b>Martial</b> <b>art</b> through a system of apprenticeship, aims at passing the traditional techniques to the apprentice; and bone setting is a trade intending to help and cure people. They are traditionally human-oriented but not profit-oriented. The combined <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> school and bone setting clinic of Master Wong Fei-hung (黃飛鴻) is a perfect example. Master Wong Fei-hung {{is one of the most}} impressive Chinese <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> practitioners in the recent Chinese history and culture. He has a remarkable status in the practice of Chinese <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> cum bone setting in Southern China, who is also a hero in many people’s eyes. As this dissertation is about the intangible cultural heritage of <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> and bone setting, a well-known character in the recent Chinese history has therefore been selected to showcase the macro significance of this heritage. Through Master Wong, who practiced <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> and bone setting, the relationship between <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> and bone setting can be more clearly explained. 　　　The focus of this dissertation will be on the practice of this living heritage via a <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> Master cum bone setter, Master Li Chan-wo (李燦窩師父), as a case study. The reason for applying Master Li as the case study in this dissertation is that he is the student of Master Wong's wife (Master Mok Kwai-lan), from whom he inherited the <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> and bone setting techniques. This background and connection could help enrich the findings of this research and increase the credibility of the research findings in this dissertation. Whether this tradition of <b>martial</b> <b>art</b> school cum bone setting clinic can be preserved, it rests on how well we respect our living heritage. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R
