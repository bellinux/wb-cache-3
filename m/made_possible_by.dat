5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> sawmill technology.

5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts.

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
