5|$|Early American {{alternative}} bands such as Dream Syndicate, R.E.M., The Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with {{folk music}} and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. {{was the most}} immediately successful; its debut album, <b>Murmur</b> (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived {{the sounds of the}} 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as The Velvet Underground.|$|E

5|$|Silverchair were an Australian rock band, which {{formed in}} 1992 as Innocent Criminals in Merewether, Newcastle with the line-up of Ben Gillies on drums, Daniel Johns on vocals and guitars, and Chris Joannou on bass guitar. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a {{national}} demo competition conducted by SBS TV show Nomad and ABC radio station, Triple J. The band were signed by <b>Murmur,</b> and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Sanford began {{preparations}} {{two years}} later for {{a run for the}} 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, {{he did not have a}} satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart <b>murmur.</b> On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart <b>murmur,</b> which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was old enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E
50|$|Heart <b>murmurs</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} categorized by timing, into systolic heart <b>murmurs</b> and diastolic heart <b>murmurs,</b> differing {{in the part of}} the heartbeat on which they can be heard.

40|$|Normal auscultatory {{findings}} were studied during a heart survey in which 12 050 Black schoolchildren, aged 2 to 18 years, were examined by cardiologists. Physiological third heart sounds were detected in 96 per cent of children, innocent systolic <b>murmurs</b> in 72 per cent, and innocent mid-diastolic <b>murmurs</b> in 0. 27 per cent. The term 'innocent systolic murmur" {{was used for}} vibratory systolic <b>murmurs</b> (70 %) and pulmonary ejection systolic <b>murmurs</b> (4. 2 %) but distinct separation of these two <b>murmurs</b> was often difficult. Vibratory systolic <b>murmurs</b> were present throughout the age range. Important features in differentiating innocent systolic <b>murmurs</b> from those caused by mild organic heart disease included the intonation, site of maximal intensity, timing in systole, and behaviour with postural change. Innocent mid-diastolic <b>murmurs</b> are short <b>murmurs</b> occurring immediately after the third heart sound in children, with no supportive evidence of organic heart disease...|$|R

5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow. and R.E.M.. The band draw their musical style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in the Back and <b>Murmur.</b> While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old {{to have a major}} impact on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a <b>murmur</b> or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart <b>murmur</b> through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E

40|$|Sample entropy {{has been}} applied {{successfully}} for quantification of cardiovascular <b>murmurs,</b> but does sample entropy reflect nonlinear and chaotic characteristics of the <b>murmurs?</b> Seven digital audio recordings from subjects with audible carotid <b>murmurs</b> were recorded. Sample entropy was calculated from periods with and without <b>murmurs</b> and compared with sample entropy from surrogates with linear properties. None of the sample entropy measures from the recordings differed significantly from the surrogates with known linear properties. The sample entropy increased significantly in periods with audible <b>murmurs</b> compared to periods without. A similar difference {{was found between the}} surrogates of periods with and without <b>murmurs.</b> This confirms that sample entropy is suited for quantification of cardiovascular <b>murmurs,</b> but {{there is no evidence that}} nonlinear signal components of the murmursare present or affect the sample entropy. 1...|$|R
5|$|Alexander, who {{was also}} a highly {{regarded}} football player, did not play organized basketball until eighth grade. Alexander played on Curie's 2010–11 varsity team as a freshman, but had little impact at first and sat out some games in December. He missed the first ten games due to a heart <b>murmur.</b> In late December, he started getting local attention as part of the reason Curie remained undefeated. During the Chicago Public High School League (CPL) and Illinois High School Association (IHSA) playoffs, he contributed significant performances. On March 9, 2011, Curie was eliminated from the IHSA playoffs in a Class 4A sectional semifinal by Lyons Township High School as freshman Alexander posted 9 points, 13 rebounds, and 2 blocks in a 66–64 loss. His late-season contributions gave Curie an added dimension, as the team finished with a 28–3 record. Following his freshman season, Alexander began to be recognized by local evaluators as a potential top national recruit. After Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor, Alexander was already considered the best Chicago area basketball prospect. He earned Red-Central all-conference recognition.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, the Buzz of Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, the Buzz of Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album <b>Murmur.</b> In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and Trouser Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart <b>murmur</b> due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Murmurs</b> {{may also}} be the result of various problems, such as {{narrowing}} or leaking of valves, or the presence of abnormal passages through which blood flows in or near the heart. Such <b>murmurs,</b> known as pathologic <b>murmurs,</b> should be evaluated by an expert.|$|R
25|$|Patients with {{mitral valve}} {{prolapse}} may have a holosystolic <b>murmur</b> or often a mid-to-late systolic click and a late systolic <b>murmur.</b> Cases with a late systolic regurgitant <b>murmur</b> may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.|$|E
25|$|Heart murmurs are {{produced}} {{as a result}} of turbulent flow of blood strong enough to produce audible noise. They are usually heard as a whooshing sound. The term <b>murmur</b> only refers to a sound believed to originate within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce a <b>murmur.</b> It should be noted that most heart problems do not produce any <b>murmur</b> and most valve problems also do not produce an audible <b>murmur.</b>|$|E

40|$|Paediatrics is an {{important}} aspect of general practice, and paediatric cardiology frequently impinges on the general practitioner. The most common dilemmas encountered circle around <b>murmurs.</b> While many normal children have heart <b>murmurs,</b> very very few actually have any cardiovascular pathology. The usual medical platitude does actually apply, in that children who actually have cardiac disease can be identified by a careful history and examination. The practice of referring all children with <b>murmurs</b> for paediatric cardiology assessment or simply 'for an echo' is to be discouraged. Only patients with organic <b>murmurs</b> and those in whom uncertainty persists after examination should be referred.
