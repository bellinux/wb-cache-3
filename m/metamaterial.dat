25|$|Negative-index <b>meta{{material}}</b> or negative-index material (NIM) is a <b>metamaterial</b> whose {{refractive index}} for an electromagnetic wave {{has a negative}} value over some frequency range.|$|E
25|$|These papers, {{along with}} Veselago's 1967 {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} properties of negative-index materials, provided the background to fabricate a <b>metamaterial</b> with negative effective permittivity and permeability. See below.|$|E
25|$|The {{science of}} negative-index {{materials}} is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that travel over cables, wires, or air. The materials, devices and {{systems that are}} involved with this work could have their properties altered or heightened. Hence, this is already happening with <b>metamaterial</b> antennas and related devices which are commercially available. Moreover, in the wireless domain these <b>metamaterial</b> apparatuses continue to be researched. Other applications are also being researched. These are electromagnetic absorbers such as radar-microwave absorbers, electrically small resonators, waveguides that can go beyond the diffraction limit, phase compensators, advancements in focusing devices (e.g. microwave lens), and improved electrically small antennas.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{acoustic}} <b>metamaterials</b> {{are one of}} the branch of the <b>metamaterials,</b> the basic principle of {{the acoustic}} <b>metamaterials</b> is similar to the principle of <b>metamaterials.</b> These <b>metamaterials</b> usually gain their properties from structure rather than composition, using the inclusion of small inhomogeneities to enact effective macroscopic behavior.Similar to <b>metamaterials</b> research, investigating materials with Negative index <b>metamaterials,</b> the negative index acoustic <b>metamaterials</b> became the primary research. Negative refractive index of acoustic materials can be achieved by changing the bulk modulus and mass density.|$|R

50|$|The {{first chapter}} {{opens with a}} very brief {{overview}} {{of the history of}} <b>metamaterials.</b> Afterwards, a history treatment is interspersed throughout the book, which frames the discussion of the related section or chapter.The organizational structure of the book begins with dividing the subject, electromagnetic <b>metamaterials,</b> into two major classes of <b>metamaterials.</b> The first major class is the SNG and DNG <b>metamaterials,</b> and the second major class is EBG structured <b>metamaterials.</b>|$|R

25|$|Light {{incident}} on a left-handed material, or NIM, will bend {{to the same}} side as the incident beam, and for Snell’s law to hold, the refraction angle should be negative. In a passive <b>metamaterial</b> medium this determines a negative real and imaginary part of the refractive index.|$|E
25|$|Superlenses {{are made}} from {{negative}} index metamaterials and claim to produce images at spatial resolutions exceeding the diffraction limit. The first superlenses were made in 2004 using such a <b>metamaterial</b> for microwaves. Improved versions {{have been made by}} other researchers. the superlens has not yet been demonstrated at visible or near-infrared wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{engineered}} materials with designed properties {{is expected to}} continue to grow in the future, and <b>metamaterials</b> are instrumental in allowing this freedom of design. <b>Metamaterials,</b> particularly acoustic, are still in the stage of infancy. Acoustic <b>metamaterials</b> are being explored theoretically, but there has been little headway on the experimental front. The design, development, and characterization of acoustic <b>metamaterials</b> will offer many opportunities in materials science. In this article, we review the basic physics of different kinds of acoustic periodic structures with special emphasis on locally resonant acoustic <b>metamaterials.</b> We first survey phononic crystals and then discuss localized resonances in intrinsic and inertial resonating structures of acoustic <b>metamaterials.</b> Finally, we present the ongoing efforts in realizing acoustic <b>metamaterials</b> with negative materials properties and discuss the implications of acoustic <b>metamaterials...</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>metamaterial</b> {{developed}} to exhibit negative-index behavior is typically formed from individual components. Each component responds differently and independently to a radiated electromagnetic wave as it travels through the material. Since these components {{are smaller than}} the radiated wavelength it is understood that a macroscopic view includes an effective value for both permittivity and permeability.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>metamaterial</b> literature, {{medium or}} media refers to {{transmission}} medium or optical medium. In 2002 {{a group of}} researchers {{came up with the}} idea that in contrast to materials that depended on resonant behavior, non-resonant phenomena could surpass narrow bandwidth constraints of the wire/split-ring resonator configuration. This idea translated into a type of medium with broader bandwidth abilities, negative refraction, backward waves, and focusing beyond the diffraction limit.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{permittivity}} εeff < 0 {{had already}} been discovered and realized in metals for frequencies {{all the way up}} to the plasma frequency, before the first <b>metamaterial.</b> There are two requirements to achieve a negative value for refraction. First, is to fabricate a material which can produce negative permeability μeff < 0. Second, negative values for both permittivity and permeability must occur simultaneously over a common range of frequencies.|$|E

25|$|They {{dispensed}} with split-ring-resonators and instead used {{a network of}} L–C loaded transmission lines. In the <b>metamaterial</b> literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and split ring resonators. The network was both scalable (from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range) and tunable. It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest.|$|E
25|$|Electrodynamics {{of media}} with negative-index of {{refraction}} were first studied by a Russian theorist Victor Veselago in 1967. The proposed left-handed or negative-index materials were theorized to exhibit optical properties opposite {{to those of}} glass, air, and other transparent media. Such materials were predicted to exhibit counterintuitive properties like bending or refracting light in unusual and unexpected ways. However, the first practical <b>metamaterial</b> was not constructed until 33 years later and it does produce Veselago's concepts.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} <b>metamaterial,</b> {{the nuts and bolts}} are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist on the scale of picometers.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} interest regarding nonlinear <b>metamaterials,</b> is the artificially induced macroscopic property known as negative refractive index. This effect {{is created by}} Negative index <b>metamaterials,</b> which are employed for use as nonlinear <b>metamaterials.</b>|$|R
30|$|All {{electromagnetic}} phenomena {{result from}} interactions between waves and materials. <b>Metamaterials</b> are engineered {{materials that are}} not found naturally. Due to unique properties of these materials, those materials are attracted for scientists especially physicists and electronic engineers. In the last decade, single-negative <b>metamaterials</b> with negative electrical permittivity produced artificially are important in optical frequencies. Optical <b>metamaterials</b> have important properties for light management. In 1968, the Russian physicist Victor Veselago is proposed the existence of electromagnetic materials called <b>metamaterials</b> with negative permittivity and permeability. Moreover, the advent of all-dielectric optical <b>metamaterials</b> provides a new route to developing novel optical <b>metamaterials</b> with both low absorption loss and isotropic optical properties.|$|R

25|$|In {{the above}} {{sections}} first fabricated <b>metamaterial</b> was constructed with resonating elements, which exhibited one direction of incidence and polarization. In other words, this structure exhibited left-handed propagation in one dimension. This was discussed {{in relation to}} Veselago's seminal work 33 years earlier (1967). He predicted that intrinsic to a material, which manifests negative values of effective permittivity and permeability, are several types of reversed physics phenomena. Hence, there was then a critical need for a higher-dimensional LHMs to confirm Veselago's theory, as expected. The confirmation would include reversal of Snell's law (index of refraction), along with other reversed phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and experiment have both shown that periodically arrayed conducting elements (non-magnetic by nature) respond predominantly to the magnetic component of incident electromagnetic fields. The {{result is an}} effective medium and negative μeff over a band of frequencies. The permeability was verified to be {{the region of the}} forbidden band, where the gap in propagation occurred – from a finite section of material. This was combined with a negative permittivity material, εeff < 0, to form a “left-handed” medium, which formed a propagation band with negative group velocity where previously there was only attenuation. This validated predictions. In addition, a later work determined that this first <b>metamaterial</b> had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation (see ref #). Other predicted electrodynamic effects were to be investigated in other research.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>metamaterial</b> was {{constructed}} as a periodic array of [...] copper split ring and wire conducting elements deposited onto a circuit-board substrate. The design {{was such that}} the cells, and the lattice spacing between the cells, were {{much smaller than the}} radiated electromagnetic wavelength. Hence, it behaves as an effective medium. The material has become notable because its range of (effective) permittivity εeff and permeability μeff values have exceeded those found in any ordinary material. Furthermore, the characteristic of negative (effective) permeability evinced by this medium is particularly notable, because it has not been found in ordinary materials. In addition, the negative values for the magnetic component is directly related to its left-handed nomenclature, and properties (discussed in a section below). The split-ring resonator (SRR), based on the prior 1999 theoretical article, is the tool employed to achieve negative permeability. This first composite <b>metamaterial</b> is then composed of split-ring resonators and electrical conducting posts.|$|E
