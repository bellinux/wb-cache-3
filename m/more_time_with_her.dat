40|$|Male Indian Flying Foxes (Pteropus giganteus) that spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{performing}} {{oral sex}} on a female also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> In humans, men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> their regular partner also perform more “semen-displacing” copulatory behaviors (e. g., deeper, more vigorous penile thrusting). We investigated whether men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their regular partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors. We proposed and tested the ejaculate adjustment hypothesis for men's copulatory behaviors: Men adjust their copulatory behaviors {{to increase their}} sexual arousal and consequent ejaculate quality, thereby increasing their chances of success in sperm competition. Two hundred and thirty-three men in a committed, heterosexual relationship responded to questions about their copulatory behavior and sexual arousal during their most recent sexual encounter with their long-term partner. The results indicated that men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> perform <b>more</b> semen-displacing copulatory behaviors, and report greater sexual arousal. We discuss limitations to the current research and highlight the heuristic value of sperm competition theory for understanding human sexual behaviors...|$|R

Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her.

She sustained life-threatening injuries after an aviation accident, in the eighth-season finale, which ultimately ended in her death. The character's death resulted in mixed critical feedback and the reason given for the departure was Leigh's desire to spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family. Rhimes has characterized Lexie as being a dork, as well as having issues with saying how she feels.

During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E

In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family, handing {{the leadership of the}} organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
