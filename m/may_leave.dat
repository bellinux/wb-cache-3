40|$|AbstractFluorescence {{microspectroscopy}} {{observations were}} used to study the processes of cell differentiation and assemblies of photosynthesis proteins in Zea <b>mays</b> <b>leaves</b> under the greening process. The observations were done at 78 K by setting the sample in a cryostat to avoid any undesired progress of the greening process during the measurements. The lateral and axial spatial resolutions of the system were 0. 64 μm and 4. 4 μm, respectively. The study revealed the spatial distributions of protochlorophyllide (PChld) in both the 632 -nm-emitting and 655 -nm-emitting forms within etiolated Zea <b>mays</b> <b>leaves.</b> The sizes of the fluorescence spots attributed to the former were larger {{than those of the}} latter, validating the assignment of the former and latter to the prothylakoid and prolamellar bodies, respectively. In vivo microspectroscopy observations of mature Zea <b>mays</b> <b>leaves</b> confirmed the different photosystem II (PS I) /photosystem I (PS II) ratio between the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (MS) cells, which is specific for C 4 -plants. The BS cells in Zea <b>mays</b> <b>leaves</b> 1 h after the initiation of the greening process tended to show fluorescence spectra at shorter wavelength side (at around 679 nm) than the MS cells (at around 682 nm). The 679 -nm-emitting chlorophyll-a form observed mainly in the BS cells was attributed to putative precursor complexes to PS I. The BS cells under 3 -h greening showed higher relative intensities of the PS I fluorescence band at around 735 nm, suggesting the reduced PS II amount in the BS cells in this greening stage...|$|R

5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{stated in}} March 2004 that he <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> Marseille {{at the end}} of the 2003–04 season. An English club and several Spanish clubs were {{believed}} to be interested in signing Mido, who had been overshadowed at Marseille by Didier Drogba. Atlético Madrid, Zaragoza, Osasuna and former club Celta Vigo were all rumoured to be interested in signing Mido, with Atlético's interest being confirmed by their Technical Director Toni Muñoz. Meanwhile, Mido was caught speeding on the way to Marseille's game against AS Monaco, which resulted in a court hearing. Reports suggested Roma were ready to sign Mido for a fee of €9million even though Mido would be out injured for the rest of the French football season. Turkish side Beşiktaş revealed they wanted to sign him, and Mido said he was to have talks with Bobby Robson about a possible move to Newcastle United.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, leaf ethanolic {{extracts}} of Vitis vinifera were assayed for their polyphenolic composition and antioxidative properties. The leaves were collected during lush vegetation period (<b>May</b> <b>leaves)</b> {{and after the}} harvest (September leaves). Air dried plant material was homogenized and the polyphenolic constituents were extracted using conventional solvent extraction procedure. Total phenolics, flavonoids, non-flavonoids, catechins and flavanols were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Both extracts were very rich in phenolic compounds. The concentration of total phenols in September leaves extract was about 30 % higher compared to <b>May</b> <b>leaves</b> extract, due to the increase of flavonoid (catechin) fraction. Non-flavonoid compound content was almost equal in both extracts. The amount of flavanols, determined with p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde method, was taken as indicator of flavan- 3 -ol monomers, while high catechin content determined by vanillin method, indicated the presence of polymeric fraction. The total catechin content in September leaves extract was more than 3 folds higher in comparison to <b>May</b> <b>leaves</b> extract. Principal phenolic compounds were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography on reverse phase. Antioxidant properties, determined as: 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical and 2, 2 '-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) radical cation scavenging ability, ferric reducing/antioxidant power, Fe 2 + chelating activity, and using β-carotene bleaching assay, were total phenol concentration dependent. September leaves extract had better free radical scavenging capacity, higher reducing power, and was more efficient in protecting the oxidation of emulsified linoleic acid, in comparison with <b>May</b> <b>leaves</b> extract which showed better chelating ability. The presence of active phenolic compounds: phenolic acids (3 -hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid, vanillin acid), flavonoids ((+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, apigenin, myricetin, quercetin, quercetin- 4 '-glucoside, rutin), and stilbenes (trans-resveratrol and resveratrol derivatives) was confirmed in both extracts. According to the results achieved, vine leaf extracts can be considered rich natural source of polyphenols with significant antioxidant properties...|$|R

5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E
5|$|The Master himself may remain, as may one ecclesiastic {{designated}} by the Congregations prior to the commencement of the election. The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope needs to have. After the speech concludes, the ecclesiastic leaves. Following the recitation of prayers, the Cardinal Dean asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain. After the clarification of the doubts, the election may commence. Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless. An ill cardinal <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> the conclave and later be readmitted; a cardinal who leaves for any reason other than illness may {{not return to the}} conclave.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Donald, ventures {{through a}} variety of side-scrolling levels. Generally, each level is divided into an {{overland}} part and a dungeon, such as the Maharajah's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides. Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections, various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order. In addition to this, some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections. Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area, he <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> by calling his nephews' biplane, and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return.|$|E

5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E
5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
5|$|Across {{most of its}} range, the pied butcherbird can {{generally}} be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can {{be present in the}} nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33mm long by 24mm (1.3 by 0.95in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31mm long by 22mm (1.2 by 0.85in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae).|$|E
5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens <b>may</b> <b>leave</b> the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
