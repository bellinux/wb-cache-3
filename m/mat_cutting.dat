50|$|Samgakdo (삼각도; 三角刀) The samgakdo, {{is also a}} {{recently}} used terminology for swords used for <b>mat</b> <b>cutting.</b> The {{cross section of the}} sword is triangular in shape; hence the name Samgakdo (which means 3 sided sword).|$|E
5000|$|Mats {{can now be}} cut using {{computerized}} Mat Cutters. Mat cutters come in a {{range of}} sizes and allow mats to be cut with accuracy and precision. This makes it ideal for complex mats, multi-window mats, oval or shaped mats or even bulk <b>mat</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|E
30|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{development of}} nanotechnology, {{our society is}} being surrounded by possible risks related to exposure to manufactured nanomaterials. The consumer market already includes many products that contain silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), including various household products, such as yoga <b>mats,</b> <b>cutting</b> boards, running shirts, and socks. There {{is a growing concern}} over the release of AgNPs in workplaces related to the manufacture and application of nanomaterials.|$|R
5000|$|The cricut {{expression}} 2 has {{an updated}} exterior from the cricut expression. It {{comes with a}} 12" [...] x 12" [...] <b>cutting</b> <b>mat.</b> This machine {{does not have the}} keyboard that the original cricut and the cricut expression have. Instead it features a new full-color LCD touch screen. The LCD touch screen displays the keyboard on the screen and allows you to see where your images will be on the <b>mat</b> prior to <b>cutting.</b> It also has the new feature of independent image sizing and image rotation directly on the LCD screen.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sewing shears, rotary cutters {{may be used}} for cutting fabric, usually used with a <b>cutting</b> <b>mat</b> to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches. Special marking pens and chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.|$|R
50|$|Eraser, rulers, templates, set {{squares and}} a T-square assist in {{creating}} lines and shapes. A drawing table provides an angled work surface with lamps sometimes {{attached to the}} table. A light box allows an artist to trace his pencil work when inking, allowing for a looser finish. Knives and scalpels fill a variety of needs, including cutting board or scraping off mistakes. A <b>cutting</b> <b>mat</b> aids paper trimming. Process white is a thick opaque white material for covering mistakes. Adhesives and tapes help composite an image from different sources.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} cricut {{comes with}} a 6" [...] x 12" [...] <b>cutting</b> <b>mat</b> and images can be cut in a range from 1" [...] to 5 1/2" [...] tall. The original cricut is compatible with all original cricut cartridges. The original cricut {{does not have the}} ability to cut as many different types of materials that the newer cricut machines can. However Cricut does make a Deep Cut Blade & Housing that can allow original cricut owners to cut material up to 1.55mm thick, such as magnet, chipboard, and stamp materials. The original cricut is also compatible with the Cricut Design Craft Room.|$|R
50|$|The {{repair of}} the <b>MAT</b> locus after <b>cutting</b> by the HO {{endonuclease}} almost always {{results in a}} mating type switch. When an a cell cuts the MATa allele present at the MAT locus, the cut at MAT will almost always be repaired by copying the information present at HML. This results in MAT being repaired to the MATα allele, switching the mating type of the cell from a to α. Similarly, an α cell which has its MATα allele cut by the HO endonuclease will almost always repair the damage using the information present at HMR, copying the MATa gene to the MAT locus and switching the mating type of α cell to a.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} cricut machine had <b>cutting</b> <b>mats</b> of 6 × 12 inches, {{the larger}} Cricut Expression only allows mats of 12 × 12 and 12 × 24. The largest machine will produce letters from {{a half inch}} to 23 inches high. Both the Cricut and Cricut Expression require mats and blades which can be adjusted to cut through various types of paper, vinyl and other sheet products. The Cricut personal paper cutter operates as a paper cutter based upon cutting parameters programmed into the machine, and resembles a desktop printer. Cricut Cake produces stylized edible fondants cut into various shapes from fondant sheets, and is used by chefs in the preparation and ornamentation of cakes.|$|R
40|$|Mat-forming {{cyanobacteria}} {{are becoming}} a common weed problem in the Midwest, but {{little is known about}} their distribution and physiology. A survey was conducted of Indiana ponds, and mat-forming cyanobacteria were found at nuisance levels throughout the state, with one species, Oscillatoria limosa, being the most prevalent. Seven species (Oscillatoria limosa, O. jasorvensis, O. amoena, O. deflexoides, O. pseudogeminata, Phormidium ambiguum, and Lyngbya martensiana) of cyanobacteria were isolated and subjected to six different light irradiances (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 700 μmol photons·m- 2 ·S- 1) and three different temperature regimes (15, 25, and 35 °C). These species grow best at 25 °C to 35 °C and that they become light saturated at low light irradiances. ^ These seven species (and an additional isolate of O. amoena) were then tested for sensitivity to a potential new biological control agent, bacterium SG- 3. Bacterium SG- 3 lysed cells of all species tested. SG- 3 killed mats (algicidal activity) of O. amoena (# 5) and slowed the growth and spread (algistatic activity) of mats of the seven other isolates. Differences in sensitivity may be due to differences in mat construction, which may decrease penetration of the bacteria into the mat. Control was observed at 15, 25 and 35 °C and <b>cutting</b> <b>mats</b> of O. limosa into smaller pieces did not increase SG- 3 activity. Data indicated that applications of SG- 3 at 107 PFU·mL- 1 (plaque forming units·mL- 1) every 22 days should slow or prevent mat growth. ^ The planktonic cyanobacteria Pseudanabaena limnetica and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, were also sensitive to treatment with SG- 3. Two isolates of C. raciborskii were susceptible to low concentrations of SG- 3 (EC 50 = 1. 3 X 10 3 PFU·mL- 1), and the cyanobacterial populations tested were within population ranges normally encountered under bloom conditions. The data also indicated that slow or partial kill of a heavy bloom of C. raciborskii could be obtained by adjusting SG- 3 concentrations. ^ DNA sequence analysis (16 S rRNA) showed that SG- 3 is most closely related to Lysobacter brunescens (99 % homology). Experiments were conducted to determine the possible mode of action of SG- 3. The possibility that lytic activity is due to a bacteriophage or a secreted compound was not supported. The data suggested that like most lytic lysobacters, SG- 3 must come into brief contact with the cyanobacterial cell to cause lysis and that lysis may be due to enzymes present {{on the surface of the}} bacterium. Based on observations made from these studies, SG- 3 appears to be a viable candidate as an algaecide for many planktonic cyanobacteria and as an algistat for many mat-forming species. ...|$|R
