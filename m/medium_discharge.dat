40|$|The high {{precipitation}} around Southeast Asia {{results in}} abundant freshwater outflow, which transports terrestrial dissolved and particulate {{material to the}} world's largest marginal sea, namely, the South China Sea (SCS). To estimate the riverine carbon flux to the SCS, carbonate data from 42 rivers were collected. These results, combined with literature data for 13 rivers, indicate that the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are positively correlated with the cation exchange capacity and the bulk density, except for the Low Discharge category. The highest DIC concentration and flux are in the Low and <b>Medium</b> <b>Discharge</b> categories. Negative correlations exist between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the base saturation in the Low and High Discharge categories and between DOC and bulk density in the Low and <b>Medium</b> <b>Discharge</b> categories. However, {{the correlation between the}} DOC concentration and the organic carbon content in the soil is only significant in the <b>Medium</b> <b>Discharge</b> category. Once the negative exponential relationships between the particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) or the particulate organic carbon (POC) and the total suspended matter are determined, these can be used to estimate the PIC and POC carbon fluxes. Of the annual riverine carbon flux, 83. 08. 1 TgC, 40. 146. 11 Tg is DIC, 25. 034. 54 Tg is DOC, 1. 830. 35 Tg is PIC, and 16. 03 +/- 2. 87 Tg is POC.

40|$|Part 1 : Knowledge-Based SustainabilityInternational audienceMost {{developed}} {{countries around the}} world are seriously concerned about recent global warming, the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental degradation. So as to meet the environmental burden reduction targets set by different international agreements, manufacturing companies are seriously encouraged to invest considerable efforts in the field of energy. Energy storage systems (ESS) have the potential to revolutionize the way in which electrical power grids are designed and operated. Presently, power grids require that the generation of electricity continuously balance the demand. The constant balancing of supply and demand has significant operational and cost implications. Incorporation of storage devices into the grid should reduce this constraint by enabling electrical energy to be withdrawn from the grid when there is excess generation and held in reserve until needed. In this work we consider stationary applications with <b>medium</b> <b>discharge</b> time (minutes to hours), thus batteries have been considered. The object is to find the optimal sizing of the energy storage device (i. e. batteries) with which it is possible to minimize the cost of energy in a production plant...|$|E
40|$|Assumptions about flow {{resistance}} in bedrock channels {{have to be}} made for mechanistic modeling of river incision, paleoflood estimation, flood routing, and river engineering. Field data on bedrock {{flow resistance}} are very limited and calculations generally use standard alluvial-river assumptions such as a fixed value of Manning's n. To help inform future work we measured how depth, velocity and flow resistance vary with discharge in four short reaches of a small bedrock channel, one with an entirely rock bed and the others with 20 %- 70 % sediment cover, and in the alluvial channel immediately upstream. As discharge and submergence increase in each of the partly or fully alluvial reaches there is a rapid increase in velocity and a strong decline in both n and the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f. The bare-rock reach follows a similar trend from low to <b>medium</b> <b>discharge</b> but has increasing resistance at higher discharges because of the macro-roughness of its rock walls. Flow resistance at a given discharge differs considerably between reaches and is highest where the partial sediment cover is coarsest and most extensive. Apart from the effect of rough rock walls, the flow resistance trends are qualitatively consistent with logarithmic and variable-power equations and with non-dimensional hydraulic geometry, but quantitative agreement using sediment D 84 as the roughness height is imperfect...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a fast-response task-specific amperometric gas sensor based on paper-supported room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) is proposed here for improved analysis of volatile acid species.

It {{takes advantage of the}} high electrical conductivity and negligible vapour pressure of RTILs and of their easy immobilization into a porous and inexpensive supporting material such as paper. The performance of this device, used as a wall-jet amperometric detector for flow injection analyses of headspace samples in equilibrium with aqueous solutions at controlled concentrations, was evaluated for phenol and 1 -butanethiol vapours which were adopted as model acid gaseous analytes. The results obtained showed that the quite high potentials required for the detection of these analytes are lowered significantly, thanks to the addition of the basic acetate RTIL. In such a way, overlap with the <b>medium</b> <b>discharge</b> is avoided, and the possible adverse effect of interfering species is minimised. The sensor performance was quite satisfactory (detection limits, ca. 0. 3 μM; dynamic range, ca. 1 - 200 μM, both referred to solution concentrations; correlation coefficients in the range 0. 993 - 0. 997; repeatability, ± 6 % RSD; long-term stability, 9 %); thus suggesting the possible use of this device for manifold applications.

To understand the functioning of the transboundary karst system many researches were performed in a close co-operation between Italian and Slovene researchers. One of the primary goals was the protection of the aquifer, in which large quantities of groundwater are stored. The springs of the Timavo River are one of the highest-discharge regions in the Mediterranean region (<b>medium</b> <b>discharge</b> of 40 m 3 /s, maximum of 175 m 3 /s).

The occurrence of these Ca 2 + transients was dependent on intracellular stores. These Ca 2 + transients could be (a) abolished by serum removal without halting mitosis, and (b) eliminated by increasing intracellular Ca 2 + buffering capacity through loading the cells with 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) buffer, via the tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester, without hindering the transition into anaphase. Microinjection of sufficient concentrations of BAPTA buffer could block nuclear envelope breakdown.

In metaphase cells, photochemically generated Ca 2 + pulses could cause changes in {{the appearance of the}} chromosomes, but the length of time required for cells to make the transition from metaphase to anaphase remained essentially unchanged regardless of whether a Ca 2 + pulse was photoreleased during metaphase. The results from these photorelease experiments were not dependent on the presence of serum in the <b>medium.</b> <b>Discharging</b> intracellular Ca 2 + stores with ionomycin in the presence of 1. 8 mM extracellular Ca 2 + doubled the time for cells to pass from late metaphase into anaphase, whereas severe Ca 2 + deprivation by treatment with ionomycin in EGTA-containing medium halted mitosis.
