To detect, investigate, and defend against such abuse, security efforts frequently crawl large sets of Web sites {{that need to be}} classified into categories, e. g., the attacker behind the abuse or the type of abuse. Domain expertise is often required at first, but classifying thousands to even millions of Web pages manually is infeasible. In this dissertation, I develop machine learning tools to help security practitioners classify Web pages at scale. These automated, data-driven methods are made possible by the efforts of miscreants to operate at scale. Crafting every scam from scratch is too expensive, so miscreants use some degree of automation and replication to recreate their attacks. As a result, underlying similarities in both Web site content and structure can link related pages together. In the end, this automated classification of ``big data'' collected from the Web has significant impact, as it enables large-scale measurement and informs potential defensive interventions. This dissertation focuses on three applications. First, I present a system for monitoring Web sites that serve as online storefronts for spam-advertised goods. The system is highly accurate, even when training data is very limited. Second, I describe a system for identifying the black hat SEO campaigns that promote online stores selling counterfeit luxury goods. This system was used to nearly double the number of known campaigns to track, and increase the number of associated stores by 69 %. Third, I discuss a system for categorizing the Web content hosted in new top-level domains. In total, this system was used to classify 4. 1 million domains in 480 new TLDs. Overall, today's scale of well-organized cybercrime demands the use of scalable defensive analysis. This setting is where the data-driven techniques of machine learning prove especially useful. Furthermore, large-scale classification has become a frequent need in security, and our methods are more generally applicable to problems beyond just the ones documented in this dissertation...|$|E
40|$|JavaScript {{has become}} a central {{technology}} of the web, {{but it is also}} the source of many security problems, including cross-site scripting attacks and <b>malicious</b> <b>advertising</b> code. Central to these problems is the fact that code from untrusted sources runs with the same privileges as trusted code in the same frame. While much work has been done to secure JavaScript in a somewhat piecemeal approach, information flow analysis presents a compelling option for providing a more systemic solution to the problem. By tracking the flow of sensitive information in the browser, we can prevent it from leaking out to untrusted sources. Formally, information flow analysis can provide non-interference, the guarantee that public outputs do not depend on private inputs. Previous information flow techniques have primarily relied on static type systems. While effective, they are an awkward fit for dynamically typed JavaScript code. This dissertation explores three different runtime enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee non-interference dynamically. The no-sensitive-upgrade check forbids updating public reference cells in a private context {{through the use of a}} runtime monitor. This approach can be done with minimal performance overhead by using a sparse-labeling strategy, which leaves security labels on data implicit whenever possible. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach. While the no-sensitive-upgrade check is effective, it sometimes rejects valid program executions that do not violate the security property. The permissive upgrade strategy is a refinement of this approach that still guarantees non-interference, but which accepts strictly more executions. When a public reference cell is updated in a private context, the permissive upgrade strategy marks the data as partially leaked rather than terminating execution. Partially leaked data is carefully tracked to avoid leaking private information. The final approach introduces special faceted values, which capture multiple views for a single object. Faceted values simulate multiple executions for different security levels, giving the following benefits:* Faceted values do not rely on the stuck executions of the no-sensitive-upgrade and permissive upgrade approaches, and therefore accept strictly more programs than either of the monitor-based approaches. * Faceted values avoid redundant computations, improving efficiency over related approaches. Finally we implement faceted values in Firefox and show how they may be used to prevent a variety of attacks...|$|E

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time.

40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of wireless mobile nodes that forms a temporary network without any centralized administration. While early research effort assumed a friendly and cooperative environment and focused on problems such as wireless channel access and multihop routing, security has become a primary concern in order to provide protected communication between nodes in a potentially hostile environment. Research in wireless indicates that the wireless MANET presents a larger security problem than conventional wired and wireless networks. This paper analyses the black hole and cooperative black hole attack {{which is one of the}} new and possible attack in adhoc networks. A black hole is a type of attack that can be easily employed against routing in mobile adhoc networks. In this attack a <b>malicious</b> node <b>advertises</b> itself as having the shortest path to the node whose packets it wants to intercept. To reduce the probability it is proposed to wait and check the replies from all the neighboring nodes to find a safe route. If these malicious nodes work together as a group then the damage will be very serious. This type of attack is called cooperative black hole attack. Our solution discovers the secure route between source and destination by identifying and isolating black hole nodes. In this paper, via simulation, we evaluate the proposed solution and compare it with standard DSR protocol in terms of throughput, Packet delivery ratio and latency. We have conducted extensive experiments using the network simulator- 2 to validate our research. </p...|$|R
