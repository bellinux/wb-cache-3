The main aim {{of this paper is}} to find out if urban sprawl influences local public spending. Data for the economic analysis came from the local balance sheets of the 145 municipalities for the year 2007. In particular, the costs of the <b>main</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sustained by the municipalities such as public transport, road and street maintenance, waste management, and water and sewer services were analyzed. This paper estimates the impact of urban sprawl, measured, for example, as total urban density or urban fragmentation, on a variety of current expenditures using the method of instrumental variables (IV); and, specifically, two-stage least squares (2 SLS) analysis. The results show that discontinuous and fragmented development patterns, calculated as the number of urbanized polygons in each municipality, are, in general, more expensive. The same results were found when were separately estimated specific expenditure functions such as the costs for providing road and transport services and environmental services such as waste collection and water services. A larger urbanized territory, combined with a discontinuous development, implies higher per capita infrastructure and environmental expenditures...|$|E

In doing so, the paper draws attention {{to a number of}} important characteristics of the Canadian federation and of its evolution in the post-war period as well as in recent years. In particular, the discussion highlights the relatively high and increasing degree of decentralization of the Canadian federation, reflected through the rising importance of provincial revenues and expenditures in the last five decades and the recent devolution of some provincial responsibilities to local governments, among other things. The discussion also illustrates the significant overlap of taxation powers and expenditure responsibilities across the three levels of government. The paper is divided into five sections. The first section briefly describes the constitutional allocation of responsibilities of each level of government. The second section looks at some of the trends in the revenues and expenditures by levels of government, as well as intergovernmental transfers in the post-war period. In the third section, the sources of revenues are examined. The fourth section describes the allocation of expenditures in each area and discusses how some of the <b>main</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> are financed and delivered.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} and analyze an Italian case of urban sprawl and its urban growth {{for understanding the}} development of a "metropolitan sprawled system". The portion of Veneto Region that is part of our case study cover about 3700 square km, for a total of 145 municipalities. The manifestations of physical and morphological sprawl came as a result of specific cultural and political situations and economic development, such as rising incomes, and were also facilitated by the local topography. The most important changes occurred in this area over the past 30 years, starting from the 1970 's: between 1970 and 1990, the population increased somewhat, but the urbanized and developed land area increased significantly. The main aim of our paper is to find out if low-density development patterns are more expensive and if local public spending is influenced by different urban forms expansions. We measure sprawl with some indicators suggesting in the literature such as urban density, population density and the territorial fragmentation. Data for the economic analysis come from local balance sheets of 145 municipalities for the year 2007. In particular, we collect the costs of the <b>main</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sustained by the municipalities such as public transport, road and street maintenance, waste management, and water and sewer services. Adopting regression analysis, we estimate the impact of urban sprawl on different current expenditures, controlling for other variables such as local taxes paid by citizens, central government aids, territory characteristics, and more others. We find that low density development patterns are in general more expensive, in particular when municipalities have to provide education services, solid waste collection and other environmental and urban management services. Our analysis wants to highlight the threats pose by sprawl in terms of urban sustainable development patterns and to put in evidence the costs of an unbalanced growth in order to let public government to re-orient their policies versus the containment of the urban growth process...|$|E
40|$|The {{decentralization}} {{process in}} Brazilian fiscal federalism was legally launched in 1988, {{when the new}} federal constitution passed. A considerable part of <b>main</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> competencies were assigned to local governments, which are supposed to perform these tasks relying on the financial and technical support from the federation. A large share of the national tax revenues was granted to these jurisdictions, directly or by means of transferences. The higher level of local revenues were not initially translated, however, into better standards of public services, {{due to a lack}} of coordination between states and federal government, in addition to technical and administrative local level deficiencies. Over the 1990 ´s the institutional framework underlying Brazilian intergovernmental relations experienced important changes that seek to strength vertical coordination between municipalities and the state/national governments. A variety of new rules were gradually introduced. These rules intended mainly to establish the specific role of each government level for each kind of public service. By 2000 a whole new institutional environment were built. Health care and education programs were the main targets of these changes and it was in these areas that institutionalization of intergovernmental relations went further. Grants on these areas were constitutionally established by constitutional amendments. And, enforcement rules adopted. The aim was to guarantee better public services quality and access to public services. From one theoretical perspective these changes should improve public services by introducing new monitoring mechanisms. From another these changes limit local governments autonomy and hinder local governments capacity to develop policies suitable to local conditions. The arguments in favor of each position are not conclusive and the dilemma is long known in fiscal federalism literature. The question to be addressed by this paper concerns the relation between the centralization trend of Brazilian fiscal federalism structure as represented by the changes pointed above and the potential for diminishing regional disparities. The hypothesis to be tested is that the greater control by federation over the delivery of local public services may improve public services quality as a whole but does not necessarily favours the convergence on living conditions between regions. To do that it will be identified local expenditure patterns in 1990 and 1999 with special emphasis in health and education and related the expenditure shifts to the municipalities 2000 UNO´s Human Development Index. Using municipality data for all Brazilian states it will be possible to evaluate first whether different expenditure patterns are related to the improvement on Brazilian Human Development Index for the year 2000, what will indicate that changes in fiscal federalism structure did not limited local governments to follow proper public services policies. Second it will be possible to assess if changes in fiscal federalism rules also contributed to reduce regional disparities in public service delivery as evidenced by HDI results in comparison to 1991. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a frenetic public debate in Britain {{concerning}} the desirability, feasibility and timing of the introduction of digital television (DTV). The debate {{has occurred in the}} context of impending convergence between television, computer and telecommunications technologies, augur-ing radical changes in the media ecology, and the numerous uncertainties – economic, technological, regulatory and cultural – that accompany such shifts. Some writers, observing these unstable conditions, argue that <b>public</b> <b>service</b> broadcasting (PSB) faces new threats; Chalaby and Segell (1999) took this perspective when deploying Beck’s (1992) risk society thesis to elucidate the outlook for PSB in the digital era. Others argue that PSB bears new responsibilities (Graham, 2000; Inglewood, 2000). As yet, little empirical light has been shed on how the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> broadcasters are responding to digitalization and convergence. This article, based on recent research, 1 analyses the response of one of Britain’s two <b>main</b> <b>public</b> <b>service</b> broadcasters, Channel Four (C 4).

By late 2001 about 35 percent of British households had one of the three available platforms, and of digital households 65 percent had subscribed to Sky’s digital satellite service, the dominant platform. But many consumers are resisting: between 30 percent and 40 percent say they have no interest in moving to DTV. 2 Tony Blair’s Labour government has been a powerful advocate of early adoption of DTV, driven by larger policy interests.

The contracting activities of the municipalities are framed by {{a complex set of}} ideologies and objectives, in addition to regulations. At both EU level and at national level, the demands for marketization of the public sector are counterbalanced by demands for social and environmental considerations. The procurement directive reflects the balance legalizing the inclusion of such require-ments by contracting. The Danish experiences, however, tell a grim tale of subordination of social requirements in munic-ipal contracting practices with implications for the quality of the service. The results of a recent study of developments in the working conditions at commercial collection companies show deterioration in respect of health and safety, compe-tence building and job security concurrent with the increase in outsourcing and competition in the sector. In the analysis of the results, a combination of municipal cost-saving strate-gies, harsh market forces and cultural influences are identified as causal factors. Drawing on a brief institutional analysis, it is concluded that the existing normative and regulative frame-work of municipal contracting needs reinforcement if societal intentions of qualified <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and acceptable working conditions are to be effective.
