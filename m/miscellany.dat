50|$|In {{light of}} such {{developments}} there have arisen projects {{attempting to make}} the vast number and array of verse <b>miscellanies</b> more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently {{through the process of}} online digitization. In 2012 Verse <b>Miscellanies</b> Online was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse <b>miscellanies</b> published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse <b>miscellanies,</b> others have attempted to arrange a corpus of <b>miscellanies</b> produced in set periods, such as Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript <b>miscellanies</b> and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been The Digital <b>Miscellanies</b> Index, an ongoing project funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

25|$|The {{broadest}} {{distinction is}} between manuscript and printed <b>miscellanies.</b> Manuscript <b>miscellanies</b> were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added {{to in this}} organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed <b>miscellanies,</b> which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers {{in order to make}} a profit. While manuscript <b>miscellanies</b> were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed <b>miscellanies</b> were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the many}} books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, {{apart from his}} diaries, was {{relatively}} slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published.

5|$|Historically, the {{structure}} {{was used by}} and for student organizations.

The junior prom, lectures from {{a wide array of}} speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The <b>Miscellany</b> News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building.

5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling <b>Miscellany,</b> but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a <b>miscellany</b> of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E

5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). In the Highlands the seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairlock. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen in Lewis alone. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 {{and the level of}} musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table <b>Miscellany</b> (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725). The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay.|$|E

Yet <b>miscellanies</b> are, of course, more than a vehicle for their contents—they are works in their own right, which repackage literature for a range of needs and interests. Such compilations can be an index not only of textual transmission, but also, more broadly, of the popular educative and social uses of literature. <b>Miscellanies</b> could be educational, ribald, pious, gender-specifc, topographically located, high, low, intended for social performance or for private perusal.
