5|$|In the pre-Columbian era, the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups. Prior to the arrival of the Inca Empire, the valleys of the Rímac and Lurín rivers were grouped under the Ichma polity.

5|$|The statute {{essentially}} codifies the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine, {{established by}} the United States Supreme Court in two cases decided in 1916 and 1918.

5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E

5|$|Many Columbia alumni {{have gone}} on to renowned careers in the arts, such as the composers Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, and Art Garfunkel.

5|$|Many Scottish names {{occur in}} Otago and Southland (the Lammerlaws, Invercargill, Wedderburn, Glenfalloch) and Scottish {{settlers}} also named Riccarton and the Avon River in Christchurch.

Scandinavian migrants left their <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seventy Mile Bush with Dannevirke and Norsewood {{and some of}} the suburbs and streets of Auckland and Wellington reflect Australian immigration (Footscray and Botany Downs).

5|$|Suter {{reached the}} 70 point <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next two seasons, {{finishing}} with 76 in 1989–90 and 70 in 1990–91. His latter campaign earned him his fourth All-Star Game appearance. Suter also played {{much of the}} season while awaiting trial after he was arrested following a June 1990 scuffle with police {{as they tried to}} arrest fellow NHL player Chris Chelios. The issue was resolved in February 1991 when he agreed to a plea bargain on reduced charges and paid an $8,250 fine. A knee injury caused Suter to miss ten games in 1991–92, but he reached two milestones during the season. He scored his 100th career goal on February 25, 1992, against the Buffalo Sabres, and played in his 500th game on March 12 against the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Tennessee {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After a short return, Tennessee's offense started the half from its 30-yard line. Crompton completed passes of 11 and 8 yards, then Virginia Tech's defense halted the Tennessee advance and forced a punt. Virginia Tech's offense began its first drive {{of the second half}} at its 26-yard line, with 13:02 remaining in the quarter. From the 26, Tech began an eight-play drive that saw Ryan Williams carry the ball on seven consecutive plays. Only the final play of the drive, a one-yard touchdown run by Tyrod Taylor, didn't feature the Tech running back. Williams opened the drive with a 21-yard sprint and had a 32-yard run during the possession that ended with Taylor's touchdown at the 8:42 <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter. The touchdown and extra point extended Tech's lead to 24-14.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru FC {{started their}} {{campaign}} in the away game against Vietnamese team Lao Toyota F.C.. A defensive lapse by Curtis Osano and an excellent free-kick just outside the penalty box from Phatthana Syvilay meant that Bengaluru were trailing by 2–0 at the 30 minutes <b>mark.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second half, Lao Toyota were reduced to 10 men, but Bengaluru were unable {{to capitalize on the}} chances created. However, C.K. Vineeth pulled one back in the stoppage time, and the score ended at 2–1 in the favour of the home team. Injury-ridden Bengaluru FC faced defending AFC cup champions Johor Darul Ta'zim at home. The game was decided by a solitary goal from Mohd Safiq Rahim in 55th minute and Bengaluru succumbed to second consecutive defeat in the AFC cup. Bengaluru FC finally secured its first win against Ayeyawady United when the solitary goal from the captain Sunil Chhetri in the first half was enough to secure 0–1 win for the team.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E
5|$|Darren {{arrives in}} Hollyoaks with parents Celia (Carol Noakes) and Jack from America.

When Mark's bullying of Luke becomes more severe, Darren decides to befriend <b>Mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope he will go easy on Luke. His attempts do not succeed and Mark rapes Luke. After the attack, Luke's relationship with Mandy begins to fail, so Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Mandy. Darren suggests that Luke might be gay and that he was responsible for his own rape. Mandy breaks up with Darren. Darren trashes his sister Ruth's (Terri Dwyer) flat and is evicted; he leaves the village soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 hit club is {{the group}} of batters who have {{collected}} 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers. Cap Anson {{was the first to}} join the club on July 18, 1897, although his precise career hit total is unclear. Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927; he ultimately finished his career with more than 4,100. Pete Rose became the second member of the 4,000 hit club on April 13, 1984 while playing for the Montreal Expos. Cobb, also the major leagues' all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit. Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 hits. Roberto Clemente's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last at bat of his career on September 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weeks after the matchup was announced, Virginia Tech sold its {{allotment}} of 15,000 tickets, while Nebraska sales lagged, only reaching the 5,000 <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time it took Tech to sell its allotment. The slow Nebraska sales were largely due to fans who had booked trips to the Sugar Bowl {{in anticipation of a}} victory by the Cornhuskers in the Big 12 championship game. Disappointed by the loss, many people elected not to make the trip to Miami. By December 27, four days prior to the game, Tech had increased its total to 15,500, while Nebraska improved to 8,000 sold. The game was the first Orange Bowl to be played at Miami's professional football arena, Pro Player Stadium, instead of Orange Bowl stadium. The move was made in order to secure the Orange Bowl's place in the Bowl Alliance, as Pro Player Stadium was a more modern facility with a larger seating capacity.|$|E
