50|$|The field {{leader in}} drum & bugle corps {{is called a}} drum major. Some corps appoint more than one, but there is usually one {{designated}} chief drum major who leads the corps in both marching direction and musical direction. Traditional corps drum majors are effective showmen who command the corps in all venues. Early in the 20th Century, commands were usually issued either through a mace or baton, and/or with whistle signals. Eventually this evolved into vocal commands and <b>manual</b> <b>signals,</b> although military units still maintain the baton-signaling methods.|$|E
5000|$|Petone {{had one of}} {{the last}} {{operational}} standalone signal boxes in New Zealand. The electric relay-based signal box on the south of the station was built in 1952 to replace the old 1905 mechanical signal box north of the station. It controlled the Melling Branch and its junction north of the station, and was usually only manned while Melling Line trains is in operation (i.e. between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm, Monday to Friday). It was occasionally manned in the evenings and at weekends when a block of line existed beyond the station, operating the crossovers to switch trains for their return journey. At other times when the Melling Line was closed, the box was switched out and the absolute interlocking (<b>manual)</b> <b>signals</b> between south of Petone and Ava protecting the junction became permissive block (automatic) signals by the presence of an [...] "A" [...] light on each signal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{absolute}} block system enables the safe working of trains between <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> boxes. As power signalling installations are implemented covering a wide area of control, <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> boxes are gradually being supplanted, and the {{absolute block}} system is now mostly confined to limited {{areas of the}} network that carry lighter and slower traffic (there are exceptions, such as the Great Western main line through much of Cornwall). As noted above all Network Rail RUSs point to lines where absolute block signalling is a bar to increased services (both passenger and freight trains). The problem is made worse by rationalisation in the 1960s which closed signal boxes and made some absolute block sections of considerable length.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{automated}} detectors, it was the responsibility of on-board train crew and track-side workers to visually inspect trains for defects, and then to bring the train to a halt, if a defect were observed. To detect [...] "hotboxes," [...] i.e., overheating bearings, they would look for oil smoke during the day or a red glow at night. As early as the 1940s, automatic defect detectors were installed to improve upon the manual process. Hotboxes could be detected using new infrared light sensors; high and wide loads by wires outlining the clearance envelope, and dragging equipment through [...] "brittle bars" [...] - frangible bars mounted between the rails. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers. A stylus-and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; if a journal were too hot, or if some other defect were detected, the offending axle would register a sharp spike on the graph. An alarm would sound as well, and the employee on duty at that locality would either use <b>manual</b> <b>signals</b> or the signaling system to bring the train to a halt and, if possible, to inform {{the crew of the}} approximate location of the problem.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel gesture {{recognition}} system for the interpretation of Irish Sign Language sequences which incorporates manual and non-manual information. We implement a set of independent Hidden Markov Model networks to recognize hand gestures, head movements and facial features into a single framework for interpreting Irish Sign Language. This framework is not specific to any particular type of gesture and we demonstrate this by showing that manual and non <b>manual</b> <b>signals</b> can be robustly spotted and classified from with continuous sign sequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a video hand segmentation tool which can help with generating hands ground truth from sign language image sequences. This tool may greatly facilitate {{research in the area}} of sign language recognition. In this tool, we offer a semi automatic scheme to assist with the localization of hand pixels, which is important for the purpose of recognition. A candidate hand generator is applied by using the mean shift image segmentation algorithm and a greedy seeds growing algorithm. After a number of hand candidates is generated, the user can reduce the candidates by simple mouse clicks. The tool also provides a hand tracking function for faster processing and a face detection function for groundtruthing non <b>manual</b> <b>signals.</b> In addition, we provided a two-passes groundtruthing scheme unlike other tools that only does one-pass. Our first pass processing is automatic and does not need user interaction. The experiment results demonstrate that based on the first pass’s result, one can groundtruth 10, 000 + frames of sign language within 8 hours. ...|$|E

40|$|The coordinated {{action of}} the eye and the hand is {{necessary}} for the successful performance of a large variety of motor tasks based on visual information. Although at the output level the neural control systems for the eye and the hand are largely segregated, in the parietal cortex of the macaque monkey there exist populations of neurons able to combine ocular and <b>manual</b> <b>signals</b> {{on the basis of their}} spatial congruence. An expression of this congruence is the clustering of eye- and hand-related preferred directions of these neurons into a restricted region of the workspace, defined as field of global tuning. This domain may represent a neural substrate for the early composition of commands for coordinated oculo-manual actions. Here we study two different prototypical network models integrating inputs about retinal target location, eye position and hand position. In the first one, we model the inter{{action of the}}se different signals, as it occurs at the afferent level, in a feed-forward fashion. In the second model, we assume that recurrent interactions are responsible for their combination. Both models account surprisingly well for the experimentally observed global tuning fields of parietal neurons. When we compare them with the experimental findings, no significant difference emerges between the two. Experiments potentially able to discriminate between these models could be performed...|$|E

50|$|In late 1973 {{and early}} 1974 the track layout was {{simplified}} and the <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> box was removed in early 1990, {{along with other}} <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> boxes on this line, and its function replaced by colour light signalling and power operated points, both controlled from Marylebone. The track alignments were improved to allow higher speed running at the junction for the services from Marylebone, and the pointwork which had allowed trains from Paddington to call at the westbound Chiltern station platform was removed. All eastbound services were moved to the former through road; the eastbound road, which had formerly extended from the platform road at West Ruislip, was closed and lifted, and the eastbound platform widened. The alignment of the turnout towards Marylebone was improved to allow higher-speed running. Fragments of the old trackwork can still be seen {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The trackwork at this station has been upgraded and now permits higher speed running up to 100 mph.|$|R
25|$|State Governments of {{both sides}} of {{politics}} began to push for reform of the railway network, proposing conversion of the Upfield, Williamstown and Alamein lines to light rail. These proposals failed, with the Upfield line instead receiving a series of upgrades to replace labour-intensive <b>manual</b> <b>signalling</b> systems. Federal government funding was made available for the electrification of the Cranbourne line in 1995. Rationalisation of the Jolimont Railyards commenced, allowing the creation of Melbourne Park and the later Federation Square.|$|R
50|$|Services {{over the}} ex-ELR Preston {{extension}} from the Bamber Bridge direction finally {{ended in the}} autumn of 1972, when the line was closed (as a result of the Preston area re-signalling scheme) along with the remaining <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> boxes in the area (though a short section remained in use for freight to Lostock Hall gas works until 1977).

40|$|The HER 2 gene, amplified in 10 to 35 % of {{invasive}} human breast carcinomas, has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} is one method currently used for assessing HER 2 status, but fluorescent in situ hybridization involves the time-consuming step of <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> enumeration. To address this issue, Vysis has developed an automated signal enumeration system, Vysis AutoVysion. A multicenter, blinded study was conducted on 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinoma specimens, including 20 HER 2 nonamplified and 19 HER 2 amplified (weakly to highly amplified), provided in duplicate to each study site for analysis. Calculation of the HER 2 /CEP 17 ratio and the hands-on time of both manual and automated enumeration approaches were compared. Overall agreement of HER 2 classification results (positive and negative) was 92. 5 % (196 of 212). The Vysis AutoVysion System requires manual enumeration for cases with scanner results within the ratio range of 1. 5 to 3. 0. When the data in this range are excluded, the agreement between manual and scanner results is 98. 8 % (169 of 171). The average Vysis AutoVysion System hands-on time per slide was 4. 59 versus 7. 47 minutes for <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> enumeration (savings of 2. 88 minutes/slide).

50|$|By 1976, the {{replacement}} of the huge number of <b>manual</b> <b>signal</b> boxes with centralised power-signalling coupled with computer-based train control and more modern telecommunications systems meant that it was no longer necessary to display headcodes throughout the railway network.

Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no train reporting number display equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the train reporting number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.|$|R
