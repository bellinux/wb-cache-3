5000|$|Many scholars, {{particularly}} those researching the Homeric {{tradition and the}} oral epics of the Balkans, suggest that early writing shows clear traces of older oral traditions, {{including the use of}} repeated phrases as building blocks in larger poetic units.

50|$|Recent {{examination}} of the manuscript Groningen 405 by bookhistorian Jos Biemans has revealed that this codex {{is a mixture of}} older and younger quires. Jacob's Scolastica/Wrake belongs to the younger part, Vanden lande van Overzee to the older part. It took probably some 10 years (1330-1340)? to write and to assemble this book, which was presumably done in the Brabantine city Den Bosch for the nearby monastery 'Marienweerd'. Most likely the main guideline to collect the quires into one codex was not the authorship of Jacob van Maerlant but the virgin Mary, which is in perfect harmony with the name of the monastery 'Marienweert'. To <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> short: there is no real evidence or reason to think that this manuscript Groningen 405 has to be a 'Maerlant'-collection. There is too much wishful thinking involved.|$|R

Yet it was an amusing experience, and he found himself able to interest both of the ladies in it.

40|$|In the {{semantic}} tradition, {{the difference between}} intersective, subsective and non-subsective adjectives has often been taken to be a lexical phenomenon. The difference between them can be encoded in „meaning postulates ‟ which {{are part of the}} lexical entry of the adjective (Kamp and Partee 1995). Alternatively, intersective and non-intersective adjectives may be treated as two different lexical categories (Siegel 1976). After a short exposition of {{the semantic}} perspective in section 1, I argue against this „lexicalist ‟ treatment of adjectives by showing that, for most adjectives, both intersective and non-intersective readings are systematically available. This suggests that the phenomenon is grammatical rather than lexical (section 2). In section 4, I argue that the difference between intersective and subsective occurrences of adjectives follows from interface-conditions, given we assume a phasal architecture of grammar (Chomsky 2001) and adopt the recent thesis that intersective modifiers are clausal whereas non-intersective modifiers are not (Alexiadou, et al. 2007; Cinque 2010). Some of the independent grammatical evidence for this thesis is shortly summarized in section 3. To <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> short: my overall proposal is that, due to the asymmetric structure of grammar, it is expected that modifiers are interpreted relative to their hosts. Subsectivity is thus the „normal case‟. However, if the modifie...|$|R
