25|$|The self-wringing mop {{is a type}} of mop {{designed}} to be wrung out without getting a user's hands wet. The first self-wringing mop was invented in 1990 by Joy Mangano. The <b>mop</b> <b>head</b> was created from 300 feet of cotton and was developed so {{that it was possible to}} be wrung out by turning a plastic handle above the <b>mop</b> <b>head</b> itself. It became widely used in America by the mid 1990s.|$|E

Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the steam}} mops feature a two-sided, flip <b>mop</b> <b>head</b> {{that allows you}} to clean twice as much floor before {{changing}} the mop pad.

50|$|Colonies of Alveopora fenestrata are {{generally}} hemispherical in form {{with a number}} of short irregular lobes. The polyps are crowded together, elongated, with a crown of long tentacles, giving the appearance of a <b>mop</b> <b>head.</b> The corallite walls are composed of compacted spines and rods, and the septa have long, tapering spines which are joined together low in the corallite. The colonies are usually greyish or greenish-brown.|$|E

50|$|The crew used {{a variety}} of dredges and trawls to collect {{biological}} samples. The dredges consisted of metal nets attached to a wooden plank and dragged across the sea floor. <b>Mop</b> <b>heads</b> attached to the wooden plank would sweep across the sea floor and release organisms from the ocean bottom to be caught in the nets. Trawls were large metal nets towed behind the ship to collect organisms at different depths of water. Upon the retrieval of a dredge or trawl, Challenger crew would sort, rinse, and store the specimens for examination upon return. The specimens were often preserved in either brine or alcohol.|$|R

5000|$|The first Japanese {{anti-tank}} grenade was a hand-thrown grenade, {{which had}} a simple 100 mm diameter cone HEAT warhead with a simple [...] "all the way" [...] fuse system in the base. (If dropped accidentally with the pin removed, it would explode). It had what looked {{like the end of}} a <b>mop</b> <b>head</b> on {{the tail end of the}} warhead. A soldier would remove the antitank grenade from its sack, pull the pin, and throw it gripping the mop-head as the handle. This was dangerous, as there was no arming safety after release and the thrower could strike something in his back swing before release. Penetration was reportedly only around 50 mm.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, a {{stone is}} {{a unit of}} weight that equals 14 pounds. Therefore, sixteen stone means 224 pounds or about 102 kilograms. When asked why lead singer Gavin Rossdale chose the name [...] "Sixteen Stone" [...] {{for the name of}} their album, he said: [...] "Once upon a time there was a lonely man... my friend, who called a phone number {{advertising}} a '21-year old Scandinavian beauty, new in town.' When she arrived, she was forty years old and sixteen stone..." [...] In the booklet of Sixteen Stone, there is a heart and a dedication to [...] "Rupert and Julie", two of Gavin's friends who died in a boating accident along the Thames in England. The cover insert has a picture of what looks like a bush or <b>mop</b> <b>head</b> flying through the air. This is actually Gavin's dog named Winston. A Puli, a breed of dog with dreadlock-like cords, that has been tossed in the air or is jumping. Beck used the same effect in 1996 with a Komondor, another Hungarian dog breed that has similar fur to the Puli, on his album Odelay which looks like a mop jumping a hurdle.|$|E
50|$|Low-level waste, {{which can}} be handled without special {{radiation}} protection, consists of materials such as <b>mop</b> <b>heads,</b> rags, paper towels, floor sweepings, and protective clothing used in nuclear stations during routine operation and maintenance. Intermediate level waste consists of non-fuel waste containing significant quantities of long-lived radionuclides. This includes materials such as used reactor core components, refurbishment wastes, ion-exchange resins and filters used to purify reactor water systems, and used reactor components such as pressure tubes. Intermediate-level waste cannot be handled without radiation protection measures. Much of the waste that would {{be placed in the}} DGR is already stored at the WWMF in engineered storage structures. The DGR would not house used nuclear fuel.|$|R

40|$|Zoos {{all around}} the world have {{recently}} started to implement enrichment into their exhibits. Enrichment has been found to decrease stereotypic behaviors and alleviate stress in captive animals. The Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa is one zoo that has implemented enrichment into several of their exhibits, including the Lar gibbon, also known as the white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar). As Hylobates lar is an endangered species, it is important to find enrichment activities that mentally and physically stimulate them to maintain their health. Previous research has found that primates prefer pliable items to non-pliable ones. We hypothesized that both the male and female gibbon would prefer the phone books, a pliable item, to a non-pliable item, a hanging barrel. Since animals have an instinct for food, we also hypothesized that both the male and female would prefer the food item, cereal, to a non-food item, a <b>mop</b> <b>head.</b> I conducted my study using a focal animal sampling approach, observing each sex for 15 -minute intervals. I recorded the duration of interaction with each enrichment activity. The results showed that both the male and female preferred the food item to the non-food item and the pliable item to the non-pliable item...|$|E

50|$|Kryten {{is asked}} for his {{decision}} regarding getting his corrupted systems repaired, and the mechanoid still can't say no. In order {{to give him the}} courage, he steals a security guard's gun and (taking Kochanski's advice too seriously) forces the superior officers present to sit on toilets. Amused by this, Kryten finally refuses to have his systems restored; however, his actions have caused the crew to decide to proceed anyway. Afterwards, Kryten has been returned to his old ways of servitude and politeness. Lister breaks Kochanski out of her quarters and, while in the lift, decides {{to make the most of}} the opportunity to try out the sexual magnetism virus on himself. Although it works at first and Kochanski practically throws herself at her ex-boyfriend, she returns to normal after a few seconds and Lister realises that the positive viruses cancel each other out. Later, after getting the Cat released, the three look for Kryten so they can all escape only to discover that he doesn't recognise them and has returned to his factory settings. Lister, Kochanski and the Cat start looking for a new disguise (since the Cat refuses to wear his over his normal clothes). Suddenly Cat hits on a great idea... with black <b>mop</b> <b>heads</b> and fake teeth with overbites they can pretend to be the Dibbley family.|$|R
60|$|A noble expose of the situation, Sir, {{you will}} admit. It left me hot and breathless.

James with his hand poised--for if he touches a piece he has to play it, Alick will see to that--raises his red head suddenly to read Alick's face. His father, who is Alick, is pretending to be in a panic lest James should make this move. James grins heartlessly, and his fingers are about to close on the 'man' when some instinct of self-preservation makes him peep once more. This time Alick is caught: the unholy ecstasy on his face tells as plain as porridge that he has been luring James to destruction. James glares; and, too late, his opponent is a simple old father again. James <b>mops</b> his <b>head,</b> sprawls in the manner most conducive to thought in the Wylie family, and, protruding his underlip, settles down to a reconsideration of the board. Alick blows out his cheeks, and a drop of water settles on the point of his nose.|$|R

Lanterns waved, or danced up and down, before and behind him; and on every side, six tracks deep, sliding backward and forward, with clashings of couplers and squeals of hand-brakes, were cars--more cars than [...] .007 had dreamed of. There were oil-cars, and hay-cars, and stock-cars full of lowing beasts, and ore-cars, and potato-cars with stovepipe-ends sticking out in the middle; cold-storage and refrigerator cars dripping ice water on the tracks; ventilated fruit--and milk-cars; flatcars with truck-wagons full of market-stuff; flat-cars loaded with reapers and binders, all red and green and gilt under the sizzling electric lights; flat-cars piled high with strong-scented hides, pleasant hemlock-plank, or bundles of shingles; flat-cars creaking to the weight of thirty-ton castings, angle-irons, and rivet-boxes for some new bridge; and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of box-cars loaded, locked, and chalked. Men--hot and angry--crawled among and between and under the thousand wheels; men took flying jumps through his cab, when he halted for a moment; men sat on his pilot as he went forward, and on his tender as he returned; and regiments of men ran along the tops of the box-cars beside him, screwing down brakes, waving their arms, and crying curious things.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{match in}} which he legitimately {{attacked}} jobber Mike Bell, Saturn immediately underwent a significant gimmick change and, possibly as punishment for his actions, was involved in storylines about his becoming infatuated with a <b>mop.</b> After receiving <b>head</b> trauma in matches against The Acolytes Protection Agency and Raven, Saturn began acting eccentrically and speaking nonsensically, allegedly {{as the result of}} a concussion. Saturn began uttering the phrase [...] "you're welcome" [...] at inopportune intervals, and then fell in love with [...] "Moppy", an inanimate mop which he believed was alive (similar to the Wilson Volleyball in the movie Cast Away). This gimmick went over well with the fans, leading to a face turn. Terri Runnels told Saturn to choose between Moppy and her, and was infuriated when Saturn chose the mop. She left Saturn for Raven, who would help her enact vengeance on Saturn by [...] "kidnapping" [...] Moppy and feeding 'her' into a woodchipper. Saturn in turn gained a measure of revenge when he defeated Raven at Unforgiven on September 23. After this, Saturn dropped the gimmick, but still remained a face, casually wrestling in tag matches at Sunday Night Heat.|$|R
