40|$|The branch {{structure}} of industry reflects {{the distribution of}} live and <b>materialized</b> <b>labor</b> by production branches, the level of social division of labor that has been achieved. In capitalist countries it {{is formed as a}} result of the shifts of capital from one branch to another in the pursuit of higher rates of profit. So far as this pursuit is connected with an increase in the organic and technical {{structure of}} capital, changes in the branch structure are due to technical progress and lead to higher social labor productivity. Study of the U. S. branch structure makes it possible to establish the most significant trends in the development of technology and their influence on the branch structure of industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Often, in practice, {{capital of}} the company {{is viewed as a}} derivative, as an indicator, which plays a minor role, and the first one should be the process of {{enterprise}} performance. Therefore, minimized is the role of capital, although the capital is the objective basis for the emergence and future activities of the enterprise. After all, the use of capital brings revenue, profit but not activities of the company as such. Only the capital invested in the production brings profit at the investment implementing the process of self-reproduction and bringing added value. At the second stage of capital turnover the value of goods is created. Methodological basis for accounting at this stage is revealing the essence of the transformation of the production cost in to the cost of finished products. Accounting purposes to carry out cost accounting, materials, labor and financial resources for production, quantification of the resulting product, the calculation of the cost of finished goods and calculation of unit costs. The production cost is a combination of cost of live and <b>materialized</b> <b>labor.</b> The <b>materialized</b> <b>labor</b> instruments of labor play the role of live labor costs are presented in the form of worker’s labor, embedded in the finished product. Traditional approaches to the notion that the accounting system should include only non-public information, and the activity is regarded as one main item of the business expenditure, are not valid howdahs. The system of national accounting should be focused not only on production but also on the market itself. Product oriented thinking must be changed to the clients’ problem-solving thinking. Based on this study {{it can be argued that}} at the stage of production the foundation for making a profit from operations is laid down. Therefore, the production has an important place in the capital turnover, and the clear organization of its accounting is necessary for the success of the enterprise...|$|E

The quantitative factors of reproduction are expressed primarily in the relations between the constituent parts of the aggregate social product, between subdivisions and branches. The most general proportion of reproduction is the relationship between <b>materialized</b> and living <b>labor</b> in the social product. Investigation of the objective trends in the movement of this relationship, especially in connection with the development of the new scientific-technical revolution, is important both for the theory and the practice of socialist planning. ...|$|R
40|$|The stude is {{an attempt}} at {{reconstruction}} of a financing system of socialist economy. Its main task was to answer the query whether a socialist enterprise has a "soft" budget as it is maintained by J. Kornai and whether it 4 s resulted by a paternalist State policies. The soft budget, according to J. Kornai is characteristic only for socialist enterprises and consists in having higher expenditures than incomes from sales and the initial financial reserves. The {{first part of the}} article explains a notion of "socialist production relations", assuming that these are determining solutions in the financial system. The article presents a position of State, enterprise and households in the economic structure of socialism and indicates at a range of market relatons. The reconstruction of financial system of State and enterprise in this system was carried out {{on the basis of the}} above findings. The author formulated a statement that a State and enterprise are toughly financing labor inputs which are, in socialism the only cost of production. A degree of toughness in financing labor inputs is varied in relation to State policies. Soft financing of <b>materialized</b> <b>labor</b> inputs in enterprise results from naturalisation of surplus product in socialism.

40|$|The article {{characterizes the}} type of {{economic}} system of the Soviet Union. In the authors’ view, modern historiography has reached the impasse trying {{to address the issue}}. The overwhelming majority of researchers recognize that the USSR economic system was socialist, with all the attendant “positive” and “negative” aspects. The article proposes to characterize {{the type of}} economic system of the Soviet period through the analysis of correlation of important production factors such as labor and capital. This analysis is based on data of the USSR input-output balances of the national economy in the 1970 – 1980 s. This source is introduced into scientific parlance for the first time; previously, it belonged to the category of “confidential”. In order {{to address the issue of}} the USSR type of economic system, the authors refer to the content of the tables containing data on common indicators of national economy during 1980 – 1986, the proportion of direct and <b>materialized</b> <b>labor</b> in total labor costs for 1975 – 1985, and the ratio of the number of the Soviet workers involved in mechanized and manual labor for 1975 – 1985. The data presented in tables reveal a major gap between industries in terms of labor costs and capital ratio: the share of capital was larger in industry; in agriculture it did not exceed half of total labor cost. In general, the level of direct labor costs in material production sectors of the USSR was slightly higher than the level of capital expenditure. Another important indicator which characterizes the type of economic system is the authors’ description of the ratio of manual and mechanized labor in the national economy. In industry and construction the share of those who worked with machines and mechanisms comprised about 2 / 3 of the total number of workers, whereas in agriculture it did not exceed 1 / 3. These statistics help move forward in the formulation and resolution of the issue of the USSR type of economic system. However, the issue itself remains open...|$|E

A rela??o de trabalho se efetivava por meio de um estip?ndio, conhecido regionalmente como ?abono?, da? a exist?ncia dos ?abonados?, que eram os trabalhadores propriamente ditos: homens e mulheres que despendiam suas for?as de trabalho em diferentes tarefas nos referidos meios de produ??o extrativistas, com iminente risco de suas pr?prias vidas. Os trabalhadores e trabalhadoras eram aliciados em seus locus familiares para exercerem um tipo de trabalho compuls?rio. Os homens passavam semanas em condi??o subumana, infiltrados nas matas com seus instrumentos de trabalho, uma rede no colo, uma ra??o de farinha e um punhado de peixe seco, na lida da extra??o do pau-rosa. Enquanto que ?s mulheres, na distribui??o das tarefas dentro do processo produtivo da usinagem do pau-rosa, cabia, sobretudo, a pr?tica compuls?ria do trabalho sexual com os pau-roseiros em tr?nsito pelas chamadas ?currutelas?, al?m do trabalho dom?stico determinado pelas rela??es sociais nas usinas como atividade ?das mulheres?.

The working relationship is actualize through a stipend, known regionally as "allowance", hence the existence of the "wealthy" who were the actual workers: men and women, compulsory mode, they spent their forces work in different tasks in these extractive means of production, with an imminent risk of their own lives. Workers were recruited in their families locus to exercise a kind of compulsory labor. The men spent weeks and weeks in subhuman conditions, infiltrates in the woods with their instruments work, a network in his lap, a flour ration and dried fish handful: the handles of rosewood extraction. While women in the distribution of tasks within the rosewood machining production process, they fit especially compulsory sexual intercourse with pau-roseiros workers in transit by so-called "currutelas". In currutelas had the houses of women, unhealthy and uncomfortable places where such workers alighted and recepcionavam their customers, for their respective intimate relations in exchange for some "valleys" switchable.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, the {{economic}} expansion in Euroland has continued at a rapid pace. However, a number of leading indicators suggest that the upswing will pass its peak {{in the second half}} of this year. Several reasons are responsible for the slowdown. The European Central Bank has corrected the expansionary course after the inflationary risks in the euro area had increased; households and firms experience a reduction of real income due to the deterioration of the terms of trade; finally the export boom is coming to an end as the world economy slows down somewhat and the effects from the euro depreciation slowly fade. Real GDP will rise by 2. 9 percent next year. While output growth will slow down gradually and approach the growth rate of potential output, employment will continue to expand swiftly, and the unemployment rate will decline to around 8 percent by the end of 2001. Inflation will remain above the ECB's target of 2 percent for the rest of this year and decelerate only moderately in the course of next year. While external factors will lose their impact, the core rate of inflation will remain headed upwards. The situation of public budgets seems to improve as there will be large revenues from the sale of mobile phone licenses in a number of countries. European governments intend to use these receipts to reduce public debt. The savings in terms of interest payments should also not be used to raise public spending. Sustained fiscal consolidation requires that government expenditures increase at a lower rate than GDP over an extended period of time. This is also necessary to support the course of lowering the tax burden in order to strengthen economic growth. Direct taxes will be reduced considerably in 2001, the reduction will amount to some 0. 8 percent of GDP. As a consequence, structural budget deficits will rise. The increases of key interest rates can be justified on the basis of the strategy of the ECB. Since the beginning of EMU, money growth has been higher than intended. Thus, there was a need for correction. Otherwise, the risks for price level stability would have increased even more. The ECB should make sure that it will achieve its target of price level stability because this is essential for its credibility. It is also important for the attractiveness of the monetary union in general. Stability risks in Euroland did, however, not emerge because of a wrong strategy but because the strategy was not followed strictly enough by the ECB. In contrast to the situation in the United States,' there is not yet an acceleration of the increase in productivity in Euroland. However, the "new economy" will also gain ground in the euro area especially since the use of the internet is increasing rapidly. But productivity gains will remain below those observed in the US partly because the share of the computer industry is smaller. In addition, the advance of new technologies is connected with substantial structural changes in the economy. If the gains in productivity are to <b>materialize,</b> product and <b>labor</b> markets must show sufficient flexibility; this, however, is more likely in the US than in Euroland. The current weakness of the euro is usually explained by cyclical factors. Interest rate differentials as well as differences in economic growth play a key role. It can be shown that there is a close relationship between real interest rate differentials and the real exchange rate. Growth differentials do not have much additional explanatory power. On the basis of the model, a gradual appreciation of the euro towards parity vis-a-vis the US dollar is forecast. [...] ...|$|R
