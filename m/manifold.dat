40|$|AbstractIn {{conventional}} Differential Geometry one studies <b>manifolds,</b> locally modelled on Rn, <b>manifolds</b> with boundary, locally modelled on [0,∞) ×Rn− 1, and <b>manifolds</b> with corners, locally modelled on [0,∞) k×Rn−k. They form categories Man⊂Manb⊂Manc. <b>Manifolds</b> with corners X have boundaries ∂X, also <b>manifolds</b> with corners, with dim∂X=dimX− 1. We {{introduce a}} new notion of <b>manifolds</b> with generalized corners, or <b>manifolds</b> with g-corners, extending <b>manifolds</b> with corners, which form a category Mangc with Man⊂Manb⊂Manc⊂Mangc. <b>Manifolds</b> with g-corners are locally modelled on XP=HomMon(P,[0,∞)) for P a weakly toric monoid, where XP≅[0,∞) k×Rn−k for P=Nk×Zn−k. Most differential geometry of <b>manifolds</b> with corners extends nicely to <b>manifolds</b> with g-corners, including well-behaved boundaries ∂X. In some ways <b>manifolds</b> with g-corners have better properties than <b>manifolds</b> with corners; in particular, transverse fibre products in Mangc exist under much weaker conditions than in Manc. This paper was motivated by future applications in symplectic geometry, in which some moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves can be <b>manifolds</b> or Kuranishi spaces with g-corners rather than ordinary corners. Our <b>manifolds</b> with g-corners {{are related to the}} ‘interior binomial varieties’ of Kottke and Melrose [20], and the ‘positive log differentiable spaces’ of Gillam and Molcho [6]...|$|R

5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas <b>manifold</b> cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas <b>manifold,</b> and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas <b>manifold.</b> The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} <b>manifold,</b> with a valve in the <b>manifold</b> that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the <b>manifold</b> is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the <b>manifold</b> from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the <b>manifold,</b> which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, <b>manifold</b> connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon <b>manifold</b> system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
