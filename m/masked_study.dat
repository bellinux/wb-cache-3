40|$|Modern {{cochlear}} implants utilize interleaved {{presentation of}} pulses on different electrodes to avoid physical interference among multiple current fields, yet neural interaction still exists. In the present <b>study,</b> <b>masking</b> was examined with four Nucleus 24 users with the banded electrode array in an interleaved masking paradigm, where a probe stimulus was interleaved with a masker stimulus. Spatial and temporal aspects of masking were addressed by fixing the masker {{at the middle}} of the electrode array and changing the location of the probe and by testing various stimulation rates: 125, 500, 2, 000, and 6, 410  Hz. In addition, growth of masking (GOM) was assessed by changing the masker level in six steps. Results indicated that masking patterns were generally much wider, regardless of stimulation rate, than those in acoustic hearing. The amount of masking decreased from the peak at the rate of approximately 0. 5  dB/mm even at the highest masker level. The pattern of GOM with the rates higher than 500  Hz was different from that observed in previous <b>masking</b> <b>studies,</b> characterized by markedly shallow growth at low masker levels or overall shallow growth. A facilitating effect of the masker (lowering the threshold) was suspected, except for the 125 -Hz condition, due to the fibers that were subliminally excited, but not discharged, by the masker with local perturbations of membrane potentials, and were subsequently discharged easily by a lower level probe when the temporal gap between masker and probe was sufficiently short. These results suggest that both refractory characteristics of neurons and neural summation be considered in interleaved stimulation of pulses at high, but clinically relevant, stimulation rates. Overall, the present <b>masking</b> <b>study</b> might provide a basis for models in psychophysics and speech understanding in current cochlear implant systems utilizing high-rate interleaved stimulation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the improvement of vernier acuity in the course of practice reflects “fine tuning” of the visual mechanisms underlying vernier acuity. <b>Masking</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that an important source of information by which the visual system may accomplish fine vernier acuity is the activity in orientation tuned channels. Therefore, we investigated whether improvement in vernier acuity after training was accompanied by systematic changes in the orientation tuning characteristics of vernier acuity (as revealed by simultaneous spatial noise masking). The results show large interindividual variation in learning vernier acuity. However, they reveal a close correspondence between the improvement in vernier acuity and the narrowing of the orientation tuning function. Thus, the results provide some support for the notion of narrowing of the orientation characteristics of vernier acuity in the course of learning...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore the}} {{potential}} application of wide-field, color-coded infrared ocular thermography {{in the investigation}} of carotid artery stenosis (CAS). METHODS: Ocular thermography and color duplex ultrasonography were undertaken in a <b>masked</b> <b>study</b> of 24 asymptomatic, consecutively presenting patients who were examined for vascular occlusive disease. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis indicated that there was a significant negative correlation between ocular surface temperature and the degree of CAS (r = - 0. 67, p < 0. 001). Similar results were demonstrated between the relative difference in CAS (right - left) and the relative difference in ocular surface temperature (right - left) (r = - 0. 67, p < 0. 001).

These findings suggest that there may be a water gradient between the front and back surfaces of higher water content hydrogel lenses during wear.

40|$|Abstract-It was {{suggested}} that some discrimination tasks (e. g. discrimination between the letters T and L) require serial search by scrutinizing each letter (target) {{with a small}} aperture of focal attention.

We find reduction in performance at short distances, in agreement with <b>masking</b> <b>studies,</b> but constant performance independent of distance outside this masking region. This constant performance is still lower than expected from masking effects and might reflect attentive processes. Sequential presentation of the targets with delays up to 30 - 40 ms, while reducing available processing time, does not cause reduction in performance, thus supporting the suggestion that discrimination of the two targets is a serial process. The independence of performance on distance suggests fast noninertial shifts of attention...|$|R

METHODS: 13 patients with serious sight threatening uveitis were included, of whom six had Behcet's disease, five had idiopathic posterior uveitis, one had sarcoidosis, and one birdshot retinochoroiditis. Onset and course of ocular inflammation, inflammatory signs, and visual acuity were assessed. Patients were treated with 200 mg (approximately 3 mg/kg) infliximab infusion. Repeat infusions were given based on clinical response. RESULTS: Infliximab treatment resulted in an effective suppression of ocular inflammation in all patients.

To test this hypothesis, a prospective, single centre, controlled, <b>masked</b> <b>study</b> was performed whereby 29 diabetic contact lens patients and 29 non-diabetic control subjects were issued with disposable hydrogel contact lenses and a multipurpose lens care regimen. All participants were given identical instruction on lens care and maintenance. Compliance levels were assessed at a 12 -month aftercare appointment by demonstration and questionnaire. Twenty-four different aspects of compliance were scored, 12 by observation and 12 by questionnaire report, of which only two showed {{a significant difference between the}} diabetic and control groups. Although the combined population of contact lens wearers was generally compliant, there were examples of non-compliance in both groups.

Intravitreal dexamethasone is sometimes administered in conjunction with the intravitreal antifungal medication to reduce intraocular inflammation although the efficacy has not been tested in controlled, <b>masked</b> <b>studies</b> [1, 5, 12, 13]. Pars plana vitrectomy is often performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, especially when the diagnosis is unknown or the vision is severely compromised.

Alternative systemic antifungals including caspofungin and voriconazole can be effective as well, although vitrectomy may still be necessary with extensive, sight-threatening intraocular involvement. Voriconazole has good intraocular penetration allowing systemic treatment alone in selected cases such as ours; when used intravitreally, it may be safer than amphotericin B [11].|$|R

Delay in the treatment of HSK can lead to a more significant corneal scar and topical steroid treatment in unsuspected active HSK can lead to corneal melting. Current culture techniques for herpes simplex virus (HSV) take several days and commercially available HSV laboratory based diagnostic techniques such as Herpchek vary in sensitivity. This study was conducted to assess the viability of a new, quicker, and simpler method to diagnose HSK.  METHODS—Direct immunofluorescence was used in vivo in a <b>masked</b> <b>study</b> to diagnose HSK in mice using a standard slit lamp with cobalt blue illumination. Murine monoclonal fluorescently labelled antibody was applied to the cornea for 10  or 20  minutes and then washed off with phosphate buffered solution. Mice with HSK were stained with either fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody against HSV or fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody against cytomegalovirus. Mice with corneal abrasions of non-viral origin were given fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody against HSV.  RESULTS—Fluorescence was seen only in the mice with HSK given fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody against HSV. This observation was confirmed upon microscopic immunofluorescent imaging of the corneal epithelial sheets.  CONCLUSION—In vivo immunofluorescence may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of HSK. ...|$|E
