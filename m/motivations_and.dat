5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another. The potential <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the inadequacies {{of the theories}} of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction. It argues that the current <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction theories are culturally biased and more suitable for individualist that collectivist cultures. In addition, they tend to downplay the effects of organisational structure on <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction. Through a literature review, the author illustrates {{how and why the}} application of the need, process, intrinsic and extrinsic theories of motivation in the collectivist cultures is problematic. In addition, she {{examines the}} roles of organisational structure and design in influencing <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction and argues that the way an organisation is structured can have an impact on employee's <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction. To strengthen her arguments, she has used empirical evidence from the study of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction among the Brunei Civil Servants. The thesis also assesses the suitability of Western measurements of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction more specifically the Job Diagnostic Survey and Job Design Index, and their possible applicability in Brunei.

5|$|Sardou's five-act play La Tosca {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the characters' <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{combined}} poetic genius with {{a practical}} {{sense of the}} theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.|$|E

5|$|Henry's precise <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> {{intentions}} {{over the}} coming years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, {{at least in the}} early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ("Defence of the Seven Sacraments") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, an impediment Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost. Henry sent his secretary, William Knight, to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily.|$|E

In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

In order to address this issue, it is necessary to determine the instructional methods that promote <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development in reading. This study examines the <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> the identity development of four fourth grade students as they experienced the reading workshop over the course of one year. Ford’s Motivational Systems Theory and Wenger’s Theory of Learning frame the study of student <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development within the reading workshop. Data related to <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development was collected weekly through student interviews, surveys, and conferences. A description of the context was gained through researcher observations and a teacher interview. Analysis of this data revealed that (1) Increased time spent reading self- selected books correlates positively to student <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development. (2) Increased responsive feedback from teachers and peers is correlated with increased <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> reading identity development. (3) These elements form the crux of the reading workshop, which supports the notion that this model of instruction encourages <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development. (4) The correlation between <b>motivation,</b> identity development, <b>and</b> achievement is not evident {{in the context of this}} study. However, this correlation often emerges over time.
