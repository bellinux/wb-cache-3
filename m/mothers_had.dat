5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering <b>mothers,</b> <b>had</b> sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The present {{research}} aimed to compare anxiety and hope between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism syndrome and Down syndrome. Methods: This research used a descriptive-comparative method and {{the sample of}} the study included 60 <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism and down syndromes. The sample was selected among all <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children {{in the age of}} 6 - 12 who were suffering from autism and Down syndrome in Kerman in 2014. In order to measure the variables of the research we used 2 questionnaires, the Pennsylvania anxiety questionnaire and the scale of aptitude toward hope among adults. Results: The results showed that the amount of anxiety and hope among <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism was different from <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from Down syndrome. Conclusion: The anxiety between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism syndrome was more than <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with Down syndrome. The level of hope between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with Down syndrome was higher than <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism syndrome.

25|$|Between 1846 and 1874, an {{estimated}} 8,000 gray whales {{were killed by}} American and European whalemen, with over half having {{been killed in the}} Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California.

25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E

They worked together again when Callaghan was Home Secretary and it was Callaghan who selected Young to go to Ulster in 1969 to implement the Hunt Report.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{difficulties}} encountered by the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities or autism in participating to community life. The participants were 21 <b>mothers</b> who <b>have</b> mentally handicapped child and 21 <b>mothers</b> who <b>have</b> child with autism from Istanbul, Turkey. Data was collected through semi-structured interview technique. Nine community skill areas were determined. The results indicated that the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism had more difficulties in participating to the community life than the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities. While the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities declared that they experience most difficulties at visiting their neighbors or close relatives, the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism declared that they experience most difficulties in going to somewhere from another place as a pedestrian.

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations.

The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. <b>Mothers</b> <b>had</b> also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions.

25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} {{decision}} to release or raise the child. White adolescents tend {{to give up their}} babies to non-relatives, whereas black adolescents are more likely to receive support from their own community in raising the child and also in the form of informal adoption by relatives. Studies by Leynes and by Festinger and Young, Berkman, and Rehr found that for pregnant adolescents, {{the decision to}} release the child for adoption depended on the attitude toward adoption held by the adolescent's mother. Another study found that pregnant adolescents whose <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> a higher level of education were more likely to release their babies for adoption. Research suggests that women who choose to release their babies for adoption {{are more likely to be}} younger, enrolled in school, and have lived in a two-parent household at age 10, than those who kept and raised their babies.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E

25|$|Polish (and Italian) {{immigrants}} demonstrated high fecundity in the United States, {{and in a}} U.S. Congress {{report in}} 1911, Poles were noted as having the single highest birth rate. The 1911 Dillingham Commission had a section devoted to the Fecundity of Immigrant Women, {{using data from the}} 1900 Census. As per Dillingham's findings, there were 40 births per 1,000 Polish people, whereas the non-Polish birth rate was closer to 14 per 1,000. Historians debate the accuracy and sample group of this data, as many Polish immigrants arrived young and of child-bearing age, whereas other ethnics had a lengthy and sustained immigration policy with the United States, meaning multiple generations existed. In reports, the birth rate was very high for Poles and by 1910, the number of children born to Polish immigrants was larger than the number of arriving Polish immigrants. In Polish communities such as rural Minnesota, nearly three-fourths of all Polish women had at least 5 children. The Polish American baby boom lasted from 1906 to 1915 and then fell dramatically, as many of the immigrant <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> passed out of their prime childbearing age. This was the highest birth rate for American Poles documented in the United States. During the 1920s and 1930s, Polish Americans were coming of age, developing ethnic fraternal organizations, baseball leagues, summer camps, scouting groups, and other youth activities. In large parts of Minnesota and Michigan, over half the population was under sixteen years old. Polish youths created nearly 150 street gangs in Chicago in the 1920s, and in Detroit and Chicago, created the single largest group of inmates in juvenile prisons.|$|E

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services inspected the grower's farms in Florida and fined the company $111,200 for violations they discovered; the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducted a similar inspection of farms in North Carolina and fined the company $184,500. [...] After the investigation, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley assembled the “Governor’s Task Force on Preventing Agricultural Pesticide Exposure.” [...] It presented its findings in April 2008, which caused the state legislature to pass anti-retaliation and recordkeeping laws, training mandates to protect the health of agricultural workers, and funding for improved surveillance.
