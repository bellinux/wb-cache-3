This purer form of charcoal obtained by the dry distillation of carbon compounds (such as wood or peat) has a high ratio of surface area to weight that absorbs color compounds {{as well as other}} phenolics and colloids in a wine.

25|$|The {{presence}} of alcohol (particularly ethanol) {{in the wine}} contributes <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> intoxication. It has an immense impact of the weight and mouthfeel of the wine {{as well as the}} balance of sweetness, tannins and acids. In wine tasting, the anaesthetic qualities of ethanol reduces the sensitivity of the palate to the harsh effects of acids and tannins, making the wine seem softer. It also plays a role during the ageing of wine in its complex interaction with esters and phenolic compounds that produce various aromas in wine that contribute to a wine's flavor profile. For this reason, some winemakers will value having a higher potential alcohol level and delay harvesting until the grapes have a sufficiently high concentration of sugars.|$|E

Shortly thereafter the Stratton branch was added in 1974, and the Merchant's Walk branch was added in 1979. In 1978 taxpayers overwhelmingly approved a $7.16 million library issue to renovate and expand the Switzer (then Central) library to 64,000 square feet, and construct the Kemp Memorial Library, Mountain View Library, and Vinings Library. The money was also used to renovate the Kennesaw and Powder Springs branches. By the early 1980s the system had grown to fourteen libraries with an annual budget of $1.5 million and passed one million materials circulated annually. The Fort Hill library was rededicated as the Hattie G. Wilson library in memory of the late librarian's 33 years of service. The final two libraries {{to be added to the}} sixteen branch system were the Mountain View and Vinings libraries constructed in 1989 and 1990 respectively.|$|E

25|$|The Empire's {{historical}} {{relationship with}} Germanic tribes was sometimes hostile, {{at other times}} cooperative, but ultimately fatal, as it was unable to prevent those tribes from assuming a dominant role in the relationship. By the early 5th century, {{as a result of}} severe losses and depleted tax income, the Western Roman Empire's military forces were dominated by Germanic troops, and Romanised Germans {{played a significant role in}} the empire's internal politics. Various Germanic and other tribes beyond the frontiers were able to take advantage of the Empire's weakened state, both to expand into Roman territory and, in some cases, to move their entire populations into lands once considered exclusively Roman, culminating in various successful migrations from 406 onwards. The crossing of the Rhine caused intense fear in Britannia, prone as it was to being cut off from the Empire by raids on the primary communications route from Italy, to Trier to the Channel Coast.

25|$|The band's 1973 album Atem {{was named}} as Album of the Year by British DJ John Peel, and this {{attention}} helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling Virgin Records {{in the same}} year. Soon afterward they released the album Phaedra, an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached #15 in the United Kingdom album charts {{and became one of}} Virgin's first bona-fide hits. Phaedra {{was one of the first}} commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the band's own sound. The creation of the album's title track was something of an accident; the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired Moog synthesizer, and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added flute, bass-guitar, and Mellotron performances. The cantankerous Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was so sensitive to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the Virgin Years.|$|E
