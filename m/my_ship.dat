25|$|Due {{to lack of}} new-building capacity, TUI Cruises {{started by}} {{acquiring}} the cruise ship Celebrity Galaxy, which was built by Meyer Werft and was owned by another RCCL subsidiary, Celebrity Cruises. She left the Celebrity fleet on 16 March 2009. After acquiring Celebrity Galaxy, the ship headed to Lloyd Werft shipyards in Bremerhaven, Germany. She arrived on 27 March 2009, and received a €50 Million, 38-day conversion to upgrade her facilities to suit a German-speaking market. After the conversion, she was re-christened on 15 May 2009 in Hamburg, Germany bearing her new name, Mein Schiff (<b>My</b> <b>Ship).</b> TUI planned to build two 2,500-passenger, 100,000-GT cruise ships in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
500|$|At 05:45, German lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon; this {{turned out}} to be from Hood and Prince of Wales, under the command of Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland. Lütjens ordered his ships' crews to battle stations. By 05:52, the range had fallen to [...] and Hood opened fire, {{followed}} by Prince of Wales a minute later. Hood engaged Prinz Eugen, which the British thought to be Bismarck, while Prince of Wales fired on Bismarck. Adalbert Schneider, the first gunnery officer aboard Bismarck, twice requested permission to return fire, but Lütjens hesitated. Lindemann intervened, muttering [...] "I will not let <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> be shot out from under my ass." [...] He demanded permission to fire from Lütjens, who relented and at 05:55 ordered his ships to engage the British.|$|E

The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05:45, {{which the first}} gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider initially reported as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them to be battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port was their precise identity revealed. The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05:53. Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed German battle order, Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The German task force was {{still waiting for the}} order to commence firing, which Admiral Lütjens did not give immediately. Two minutes later, after multiple inquiries by Schneider, [...] ""? (Permission to open fire?), an impatient Lindemann responded: [...] "" [...] (I'm not letting <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!) At 06:01, the fifth salvo by Bismarck, fired at a range of about , was seen to hit Hood abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one [...] shell struck somewhere between Hood's mainmast and 'X' turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from Hood from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of Hood, and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.|$|E

2500|$|Lieutenant Wilson later {{testified at}} his court martial {{proceedings}} that he first {{realized that the}} two aircraft had collided {{when he heard a}} [...] "noise and a wrenching of <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> up... to my left." [...] He also testified that he noticed that his aircraft handled sluggishly and the right engine felt [...] "rough." [...] He was informed by his copilot that they had hit the airliner. The B-34 called the Palm Springs tower to notify them of the accident and then subsequently landed at Palm Springs Army Airport.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{witnesses}} testify Captain Lindeman muttered, [...] "I {{will not}} allow <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> to be shot out from under my arse. Open fire!". Finally Lütjens gave the order to return fire. Lütjens then ordered a turn to port, and crossed Holland's T, as his opponent turned to bring all the British guns to bear. Shortly before firing, Bismarck {{was hit in the}} forecastle, though Prinz Eugen had registered hits on Hood which had started a large series of fires making it easier for the Germans to home in on her position. Bismarck then targeted Hood.|$|E
2500|$|Ordronaux's {{most famous}} {{accomplishment}} {{took place in}} the fall of 1814. The Prince de Neufchatel was making her first privateering cruise out of a U.S. port with a very small crew of 33 men. Four days out of Boston, she captured the English merchantmen Douglass and took it under tow. On 11 October, and with Douglass still under tow, Prince de Neufchatel met the British 40 gun frigate [...] off the southeastern tip of Martha's Vineyard. Of this battle, Captain Henry Hope of HMS Endymion said, [...] "the extraordinary feature of this affair {{lies in the fact that}} a vessel fitted out at private expense actually frustrated the utmost endeavours of an English frigate, of vastly superior force in guns and men, to capture the privateer. We lost as many men in our efforts to seize the Prince de Neufchâtel as we would have done had <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> engaged a regular man-or-war of equal force. The people in the privateer conducted their defence in the most heroic and skilful manner." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941, [...] was sunk, {{probably}} by Bismarck. The hydrophones on Prinz Eugen detected {{the sounds of}} an unknown ship to port at 05:00. The Germans sighted the smoke stacks of two ships at 05:45, which triggered the alarm on Bismarck. Schneider initially reported them as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them as battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port were their precise identities revealed. The British ships started firing at the German force at 05:53. Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed battle order, Prince of Wales and Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The commander of the Prince of Wales, Captain John Leach, detected this error and directed his guns to fire on Bismarck. The German task force was {{still waiting for the}} order to commence firing. The commander of the German task force, Admiral Lütjens, did not give this order immediately. Two minutes into the battle and after multiple inquiries by Schneider, [...] ""? (Question. Open fire?) an impatient Lindemann responded: [...] ""!. (I'm not letting <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!). This Lindemann quotation is cited by Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg who at the time was in the after gun director keeping a watch out for Suffolk and Norfolk and listening to Schneider's commands over the gunnery intercom. This conversation most likely was passed down by a surviving crew member who overheard the conversation between Schneider and Lindemann. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg, Lindemann's personnel adjutant, would become the highest-ranking officer to survive the Bismarcks last battle on 27 May 1941. A lot of what we know today about the final days of Bismarck is attributed to his account as a witness.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of <b>my</b> <b>ship</b> [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
