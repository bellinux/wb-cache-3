5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and <b>minima</b> in the pressure field. The <b>minima</b> are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} bi-criteria geometric optimization problems, in particular, the <b>minimum</b> diameter <b>minimum</b> cost spanning tree {{problem and the}} <b>minimum</b> radius <b>minimum</b> cost spanning tree prob-lem {{for a set of}} points in the plane. The former problem is to construct a <b>minimum</b> diameter spanning tree among all possible <b>minimum</b> cost spanning trees, while the latter is to construct a <b>minimum</b> radius span-ning tree among all possible <b>minimum</b> cost spanning trees. The graph-theoretic <b>minimum</b> diameter <b>minimum</b> cost spanning tree (MDMCST) problem and the <b>minimum</b> radius <b>minimum</b> cost spanning tree (MRM-CST) problem {{have been shown to be}} NP-hard. We will show that the geometric version of these two problems, GMDMCST problem and GMRMCST problem are also NP-hard. We also give two heuristic algo-rithms, one MCST-based and the other MDST-based for the GMDMCST problem and present some experimental results. ...|$|R
