Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. <b>Medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Tawau Hospital, on Tanjung Batu Street, is the town's main hospital and an important healthcare facility for patients from Semporna, Lahad Datu, Kunak, and Sandakan. Indonesian patients near the border area also frequently visit the hospital. Tawau Specialist Polyclinics (TSPC) is a walk-in healthcare clinic that sees patients from Tawau and surrounding areas as well as patients from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. TSPC has a range of medical specialists, a <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> and radiology services. The hospital has undergone a series of modernisations since 1990 with the construction of specialist clinics, Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD), new wards and operation theatres. Tawau Specialist Hospital is the only private hospital in the town. The Tawau Regional Library is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the others are at Keningau and Sandakan. These libraries are operated by the Sabah State Library department. Some schools, colleges, or universities have private libraries.|$|E

The effectiveness of OSHMS implementation was influenced by inhibiting and supporting factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the inhibiting and supporting factors towards the implementation of OSHMS in <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Result : This study showed the level of compliance to the OSHMS MS 1722 guideline among <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> who are MS ISO 15189 accredited & have a higher scores in overall measurement indicators OSHMS compared to those do not have SAMM accreditation. Private <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> services have higher scores in overall measurement indicators OSHMS, compared to government <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> However, there was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> which have ISO 9000 quality management system certification, compared to level of compliance to the OSHMS MS 1722 guideline among <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Therewas also no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the laboratories who had been operating for more than 10 years compared to those with less than 10 years, towards implementing the OSHMS. Results showed that majority of <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> management perceived that difficulty and complexities of OSH legislation are the most important factor that prevent them from implementing OSHMS in their organization. The most important supporting factor, that <b>medical</b> <b>laboratories</b> management perceived as the most important to comply to the OSHMS were their moral responsibilities towards the community.

5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace <b>Medical</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to improve the match between graduate training and employer requirements when relevant organizations interact with university faculty and manage to obtain money for laboratories and equipment. The competence of <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> technicians was improved in five Ethiopian universities.

The Centre for Disease Control Ethiopia and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) together with university faculty assessed <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> education. The curriculum was revised and standardized to include practical training which formed part of the final assessment. Faculty staff were trained in grant writing and quality management systems.

25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in clinical chemistry to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and picric acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory.</b> It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|An assay (analysis) {{is never}} an {{isolated}} process {{and must be}} combined with pre- and post-analytic procedures. The information communication (e.g. request to perform an assay and further information processing) or specimen handling (e.g. collection, transport and processing) that are done {{until the beginning of}} an assay are the preanalytic steps. Similarly, after the assay, the result may be documented, verified and transmitted/communicated in steps that are called post-analytic steps. Like any multi-step information handling and transmission systems, variation and errors in the communicated final results of an assay involve corresponding parts in every such step; i.e. not only analytic variations and errors intrinsic to the assay itself but also variations and errors involved in preanalytic and post analytic steps. Since the assay itself (the analytic step) gets much attention, steps that get less attention by the chain of users, i.e. the preanalytic and the post analytic steps, are often less stringently regulated and generally more prone to errors – e.g. preanalytic steps in <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> assays may contribute to 32–75% of all lab errors.|$|E
