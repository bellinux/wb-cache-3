5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E

The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family {{that the police}} had offered <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. The IPCC ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Still 200 {{miles from}} the Afghan border, the {{expedition}} now had to race against time. Ahead were British patrols of the East Persia Cordon (later known as the Seistan Force) and Russian patrols. By September, the German codebook lost by Wassmuss had been deciphered, which further compromised the situation. Niedermayer, now in charge, {{proved to be a}} brilliant tactician. He sent three feint patrols, one to north-east to draw away the Russian troops and one to the south-east to draw away the British, while a third patrol of thirty armed Persians, led by a German officer—Lieutenant Wagner—was sent ahead to scout the route. After leading the Russians astray, the first group was to remain in Persia to establish a secret desert base as a refuge for the main party. After luring away the British, the second group was to fall back to Kermanshah and link with a separate German force under Lieutenants Zugmayer and Griesinger. All three parties were ordered to spread <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> about their movements to any nomads or villagers they met. Meanwhile, the main body headed through Chehar Deh for the region of Birjand, close to the Afghan frontier. The party covered forty miles before it reached the next village, where Niedermayer halted to await word from Wagner's patrol. The villagers were meanwhile barred from leaving. The report from Wagner was bad: His patrol had run into a Russian ambush and the desert refuge had been eliminated. The expedition proceeded towards Birjand using forced marches to keep a day ahead of the British and Russian patrols. Other problems still confronted Niedermayer, among them the opium addiction of his Persian camel drivers. Fearful of being spotted, he had to stop the Persians a number of times from lighting up their pipes. Men who fell behind were abandoned. Some of the Persian drivers attempted to defect. On one occasion, a driver was shot while he attempted to flee and betray the group.|$|E

30|$|Eyewitness memory {{researchers}} {{have long been}} concerned with factors that influence accurate memory for an originally witnessed event. Towards this end, {{there has been a}} substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding the misinformation effect. In a typical misinformation experiment, participants witness an original event. The event usually {{takes the form of a}} series of slides or a short video depicting a crime. After some retention interval participants are exposed to <b>misleading</b> post-event <b>information</b> in the form of a narrative or suggestive questions. Following misinformation presentation, memory for the original event is assessed. The typical finding is that exposure to <b>misleading</b> post-event <b>information</b> results in reduced access to original event details and increased reporting of misleading post-event details (Frenda, Nichols, & Loftus 2011).|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that <b>misleading</b> postevent <b>information</b> can alter the report of a previously witnessed event. The present experiment extends on this research by investigating whether central and peripheral details are affected differentially by <b>misleading</b> postevent <b>information.</b> Sixty-four undergraduate students were shown a series of slides depicting a theft from a convenience store. They were then exposed to a taped narrative which contained some misinformation and some neutral information about two central and two peripheral critical details. Finally, the subjects 2 ̆ 7 memory for the original event was tested using recognition and source questions. The accuracy data replicated the misinformation effect p 3 ̆c. 05.

25|$|Visual {{memory is}} not always {{accurate}} and can be misled by outside conditions. This {{can be seen in}} studies carried out by Elizabeth Loftus and Gary Wells. In one study by Wells, individuals were exposed to <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> after witnessing an event; they were then tested on their ability to remember details from this event. Their findings included: when given misinformation that contradicts the witnessed event they were less able to recall those details; and whether misinformation was given before or after the witnessed event did not seem to matter. Furthermore, visual memory can be subjected to various memory errors which will affect accuracy.|$|E

Early <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> and delays in communication led Plumer and Haig to plan the next attack on 12 October (First Battle of Passchendaele) {{under the impression that}} a substantial advance had taken place at Passchendaele ridge, when most of the captured ground had been lost to German counter-attacks.|$|E

25|$|Shareholders {{were given}} the option of either one Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share, or $1.61 {{and a half of}} a Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share. This offer finally gave true {{financial}} value to the shares, inclining many shareholders to sell them. Both Sun-Rype's board of directors and the BC Fruit Growers Association argued against the takeover attempt to shareholders, and on July 18, the board of directors offered an 18–page document detailing why shareholders should refrain from selling. On July 24, just days later, Clearly Canadian also sent out a document describing to shareholders why they should sell their shares. Both of these documents contained invalid and <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> about each company, such as share values and purchase options to shareholders, so on July 31, the British Columbia Securities Commission issued an order for both companies to correct the statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} {{have been subject to}} criticism, both in the media and in formal proceedings before the Braidwood Commission of Inquiry. The officers were served notices of misconduct by the commission forewarning them the commissioner may include a finding of misconduct in its final report. The warnings allege specific but overlapping grounds for each of the four. The collective allegations are that they failed to properly assess and respond to the circumstances in which they found Mr. Dziekański. They repeatedly deployed the taser without justification and separately failed to adequately reassess the situation before further deploying it. The notices allege that afterwards they misrepresented facts in notes and statements, furthered the misrepresenting before the commission and provided further <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> about other evidence before the commission. The four officers each sought judicial review to prevent the commission from making findings based on the notices. The petitions were dismissed. Three of the officers appealed and lost. In July 2013 one of the three officers was cleared of perjury. The remaining two officers stood trial in 2014.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and {{have little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E

In two experiments, subjects either took an initial test or performed a filler task after they viewed a video event. They were then given post-event information before they took a final test. Critically, one group of subjects was warned about potential inaccuracies in the post-event narrative and the other group was not. Without a warning, subjects who received an initial test were more likely to endorse <b>misleading</b> post-event <b>information,</b> replicating the retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES) effect.

25|$|The thrust against Lahore {{consisted}} of the 1st Infantry Division supported by the three tank regiments of the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade; they quickly advanced across the border, reaching the Ichhogil (BRB) Canal by 6 September. The Pakistani Army held the bridges over the canal or blew up those it could not hold, effectively stalling any further advance by the Indians on Lahore. One unit of the Indian Jat Regiment, 3 Jat, had also crossed the Icchogil canal and captured the town of Batapore (Jallo Mur to Pakistan) {{on the west side}} of the canal. The same day, a counter offensive consisting of an armoured division and infantry division supported by Pakistan Air Force Sabres forced the Indian 15th Division to withdraw to its starting point. Although 3 Jat suffered minimal casualties, the bulk of the damage being taken by ammunition and stores vehicles, the higher commanders had no information of 3 Jat's capture of Batapore and <b>misleading</b> <b>information</b> led to the command to withdraw from Batapore and Dograi to Ghosal-Dial.
