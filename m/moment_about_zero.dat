In this paper, we discuss a portfolio adjusting problem {{under the assumption}} that the returns of risky assets are fuzzy numbers and there exist general transaction costs in portfolio adjusting process. In the proposed model, we take the first possibilistic <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> <b>zero</b> of a portfolio as the investment return and the second possibilistic moment about the possibilistic mean value of the portfolio as the investment risk. To solve the proposed model, a modified artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is developed for calculating the optimal portfolio adjusting strategy.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the rather small number of crossings in real syntactic dependency trees is a side-effect of pressure for dependency length minimization. Here we answer a related important research question: {{what would be the}} expected number of crossings if the natural order of a sentence was lost and replaced by a random ordering? We show that this number depends only on the number of vertices of the dependency tree (the sentence length) and the second <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> <b>zero</b> of vertex degrees. The expected number of crossings is minimum for a star tree (crossings are impossible) and maximum for a linear tree (the number of crossings is of the order of the square of the sequence length).

The proposed SMA method enables high resolution mammo-gram images to be produced at lower levels of radiation exposure to the patient. The SMA method {{takes advantage of the}} statistical characteristics of the underlying breast tis-sues being imaged to produce high resolution mammogram images with enhanced fine tissue details such that the pres-ence of masses and microcalcifications can be more easily identified. In the SMA method, the superresolution problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem using an adaptive third-order Markov prior model, and solved ef-ficiently using a conjugate gradient approach. The priors are adapted based on the inter-pixel likelihoods of the first <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> <b>zero</b> (mean), second central moment (vari-ance), and third and fourth standardized moments (skew-ness and kurtosis) from the low resolution images. Exper-imental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMA method at enhancing fine tissue details when compared to existing resolution enhancement methods. ...|$|E
40|$|This main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the effects of export taxes on the risk faced by farmers in different regions of Argentina in their cropping operations for wheat, sunflower, soybeans and corn. In the first chapter we introduce the variables and explain the agricultural environment in Argentina. A set of three profit function models with different export tax policies were specified in a Monte Carlo simulation template using data from 1985 to the present. A set of risk measures for {{the upper and lower}} partial moments along with the overall probability distribution statistics are used to asses profit risk on each simulation output for the three models. It was found that the model with variable-rate export tax modestly reduces the downside risk while increasing the upside dispersion offering larger profit opportunities. For the fixed-rate export tax model the probability of low partial <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> <b>zero</b> has more mass, especially in the marginal regions. The model without export tax shows overall positive means and more mass on the upside of the distribution as expected. Comparison of results with normal distributions for the input variables with those from distributions that fit the data the best showed {{that there is not a}} clear pattern, however the differences could be significant given that the probability mass could shift to the other side of the benchmark established at zero profits and therefore could affect farmers’ management strategies.
