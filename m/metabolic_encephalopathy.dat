40|$|This current PhD Thesis (by {{published}} work / retrospective) in Neuroscience focuses on performed studies of three crucial brain enzyme activities under seven categories of experimentally- simulated toxic and <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> The studied enzymes were: (a) acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3. 1. 1. 7), (b) sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+- ATPase, EC 3. 6. 3. 9, formerly EC 3. 6. 1. 3), and (c) magnesium adenosine triphosphatase (Mg 2 +- ATPase, EC 3. 6. 3. 2, formerly EC 3. 6. 1. 3). The studied experimentally-simulated toxic and <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> were: (a) thyroid-hormone-related brain dysfunctions (as {{a result of}} hyper- or hypothyroidism), (b) thioacetamide-induced fulminant hepatic encephalopathy, (c) streptozotocin-induced diabetic encephalopathy, (d) experimentally-simulated Wernicke’s encephalopathy (arising from chronic ethanol consumption, dietary thiaminedeprivation and pyrithiamine-administration), (e) manganese-induced neurotoxicity, (f) lanthanum- induced neurotoxicity, and (g) nickel-induced neurotoxicity. Enzymatic activities were determined spectrophotometrically on albino Wistar rat brain homogenates. Assessments of brain homogenates’ antioxidant status, in vivo antioxidant administrations, in vitro experiments, brain homogenates’ enzymatic activity determinations, as well as pure enzyme activity determinations (under various conditions), were performed (wherever required) in order to elucidate the nature {{of some of the}} observed in vivo findings, to evaluate the potential limitations of the experimental-simulation techniques and / or to study the potential use of known antioxidants as neuroprotective agents.

40|$|Abstract Temozolomide in {{combination}} with radiation has been in use for more than 5 years for the therapy of glioblastoma. Known adverse effects concerning the gas-trointestinal system are elevation of liver enzymes. We present {{the case of a}} patient treated with temozolomide who developed severe cholestatic liver damage and con-secutive hepatic encephalopathy. Neurological symptoms were mistaken as being caused by focal brain damage for more than 9 months. After the correct diagnosis had been made and the treatment had been started, the patient’s condition ameliorated. In conclusion, neurological deficits in patients with known brain lesion should not be attributed automatically to the pre-existing damage even if it is pro-gressive but should be examined carefully, also including toxic and <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> into the differential diagnosis. Furthermore, new side effects of drugs have to be considered. At least this case might lead to a closer monitoring of liver enzymes during temozolomide therapy...|$|R

40|$|Early onset epileptic encephalopathies {{represent}} a struggling challenge in neurological clinical practice, mostly in infants and very young children, {{partly due to}} an unclear and still debated cathegorization. In this scenario genetic and <b>metabolic</b> epileptic <b>encephalopathies</b> play a central role, with new entries still needing an arrangement. In this Paper we present a brief overview on genes, metabolic disorders and syndromes picturing the pathogenesis of genetic and <b>metabolic</b> epileptic <b>encephalopathies</b> with onset under one year of age. These forms will be classified, according to a combined clinical and genetic-metabolic criterion, into two main groups including seizures as prominent/unique symptom and seizures associated with a syndromic phenotype. Starting from this classification we suggest a possible simplified diagnostic algorithm, discussing main decision making nodes in practical patients management. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to guide through metabolic and molecular-genetic work up and to clarify "where" and "what" to search in biochemical, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging investigations.

These cells are actively infected with HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin. The essential features of ADC are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioral change. Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioral changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal loss.|$|E

40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} NH 4 + {{in the brain}} impair {{neuronal}} function. We studied the effects of NH 4 + on postsynaptic inhibition of cultured rat brain neurons using whole-cell recording under nominally HCO 3 - free conditions. Application of NH 4 + shifted the reversal potentials for spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and currents elicited by dendritic GABA applications in a positive direction because [Cl-]i increased. The positive shift of the reversal potentials of GABA induced Cl- currents was equal upon equimolar elevation of [NH 4 +]o or [K +]o, respectively. The NH 4 + induced increase in [Cl-]i was reversed by an inhibitor of cation-anion cotransport, furosemide (0. 1 mM), but not by bumetanide (0. 01 mM) or by replacement of [Na +]o by Li +. We conclude that KCC 2 transports NH 4 + similar to K +. Despite this fact, the small increase of [NH 4 +]o during <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> will barely elevate [Cl-]i. However an impairment of neuronal function may result because KCC 2 provides a pathway to accumulate NH 4 + and, thereby, a continuous acid load to neurons.

40|$|Clinical 1 H {{spectroscopy}} of {{the brain}} is complemented by parallel analyses of biopsy specimens and by studies of animal models of disease. 1 H spectroscopy {{has been carried out}} on perchloric acid extracts of biopsy specimens from patients with intracranial tumours. The data suggest that clinical spectroscopy may be useful in the identification and grading of these tumours. In addition, the spectra from extracts derived from normal white matter add weight to the possibility that acetyl-containing compounds other than N-acetylaspartate may make a significant contribution to the signal at 2. 0 ppm in vivo. Edited 1 H spectra of brain metabolites in rats with acute liver failure demonstrate an elevation of glutamine and of lactate, suggesting a role for 1 H spectroscopy in clinical investigations of <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> However, the observation and resolution of signals from glutamate and glutamine is more difficult at the lower fields that are available for clinical spectroscopy. Finally, some studies of patients with inborn errors of metabolism are described.

Investigations of the metabolic abnormalities associated with Canavan's disease have shed further light on a possible role for N-acetylaspartate...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxemia {{is a major}} comorbid {{factor for}} {{permanent}} brain damage in several <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> To determine whether hypoxia impairs brain adaptation to hyponatremia, worsening brain edema, we performed in vitro and in vivo stud-ies in cats and rats with hyponatremia plus either ischemic or hypoxic hypoxia. Mortality with hypoxic hypoxia was 0 %; with hyponatremia, 22 %; and with hyponatremia + hypoxia, 100 %. Hyponatremia in cats produced brain edema, with a compensa-tory decrease of brain sodium. Ischemic hypoxia also resulted in brain edema, but with elevation of brain sodium. However, when ischemic hypoxia was superimposed upon hyponatremia, there was elevation of brain sodium with further elevation of water. Outward sodium transport in cat cerebral cortex synap-tosomes was measured via three major pathways through which brain osmolality can be decreased. After hyponatremia, sodium transport was significantly altered such that brain cell osmolality would decrease: 44 % increase in Na+-K+-ATPase transport activity (ouabain inhibitable); 26 % decrease in amilo-ride-sensitive sodium uptake. The change in veratridine-stimu-lated sodium uptake was not significant (P> 0. 05). When ischemic hypoxia was superimposed upon hyponatremia, all of the cerebral adaptive changes induced by hyponatremia alone were eliminated. Thus, hypoxia combined with hyponatremia produces a major increase in brain edema and mortality, proba-bly by eliminating the compensatory mechanisms of sodium transport initiated by hyponatremia that tend to minimize brai...|$|R

PATIENTS: 26 patients admitted to hospital with HIV and new-onset psychotic symptoms, defined according to DSM-III-R criteria. OUTCOME MEASURES: A semistructured psychiatric interview using the Psychopathology Assessment Scale (AMDP- 4) of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry system. Comprehensive medical assessments, including laboratory tests and computed tomographic scans, were also performed. RESULTS: Patients with cerebral opportunistic infections or <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (i. e., "secondary" psychosis, n = 13) {{were more likely to}} show disorders of consciousness, disorders of orientation and disturbances of attention and memory than those with no evidence of HIV-related cerebral disease (i. e., "primary" psychosis, n = 13); 10 patients (77 %) with cerebral opportunistic infections or <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> and only 1 (8 %) patient without (p < 0. 001) were diagnosed with delirium. These associations were stronger for the "secondary" patients with no focal brain lesions than for those with lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that "organic" symptoms of psychosis in those infected with HIV are related to the systemic and cerebral complications of HIV infection rather than to the psychotic process itself...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{diagnosis}} and management of drug overdosage in a two-part presentation. Data sources: A review of articles reported on drug overdose and poisoning. Summary of review: A patient who has taken an overdose of a common drug often presents with an alteration in neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The differential diagnosis includes, central nervous system injury and <b>metabolic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (e. g. hepatic failure, hyponatraemia, hypocapnia, hypoglycaemia). In general, measures to prevent absorption (e. g. emesis, gastric lavage) or increase excretion (e. g. diuresis, catharsis) of the drug, have not been shown consistently to reduce mortality associated with drug toxicity. However, in selected instances, adsorbents (activated charcoal, Fuller’s earth), gastric lavage and haemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy are useful {{in the management of}} drug overdosage and specific antidotes can be recommended for individual poisons. Nevertheless, as the major hazards of an overdose are aspiration, hypoventilation, hypoxia, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias, the most important aspects in the management of a poisoned patient is the maintenance of the patient’s airway, ventilation and circulation, while the drug is excreted. The diagnosis and management of common drug overdoses (e. g sedative, hypnotic, psychoactive, neuroleptic, anticonvulsant, sympathomimetic, analgesic and cardiac drugs) as well as the alcohols are discussed {{in the first part of}} this presentation on clinical toxicology. Conclusions: In the critically ill overdosed patient, while activated charcoal, continuous renal replacement therapy and specific antidotes may be of benefit in selected cases, maintenance of the patient’s airway, ventilation and circulation still remain the most important aspects of management.
