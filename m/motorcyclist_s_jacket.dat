Utilizing the strategy of upcycling, combined {{with the concept of}} traditional Chinese dress style, Qipao, the purpose of this design was to refashion and add new value and significance to secondhand men 2 ̆ 7 s suits and neckties by creating a culturally inspired feminine dress with ornamental detail. Both the tailored men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>jackets</b> and neckties were made out of quality fabrics despite small damaged areas. By redesigning and making use of these otherwise underused items, they are given prolonged life and increased value.

Choosing locally produced, natural fibers and a low pollution dye method allows this product to appeal on the basis of sustainability as well as fit. Wool purchased from a Georgia rancher was scoured and spun by a woolen mill and hand-dyed using space-dye techniques to create an ikat effect. Sampling was used over successive iterations to determine the spacing of skeins in proportion to the dye vat in order to produce the desired shapes in the final border. A larger version of the motif was chosen for the central portion order to allow the space-dyed border to flow visually around the wearer...|$|R
40|$|Dwight Kimberly is {{featured}} {{here in his}} letterman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>jacket.</b> In the {{quarter of a century}} he taught classes at George Fox, Dwight Kimberly earned the respect and admiration of both his peers and his students. Many remember him as the 2000 Oregon Professor of the Year, but winning honors was never Kimberly’s agenda. Rather, the biology professor took pride in investing in his pupils. It wasn’t uncommon for him to spend late hours helping students in lab or engage in conversations with them outside the classroom. To him, every student was a puzzle in need of a solution, prompting him to ask, “How can I unlock that puzzle and {{get the most out of}} you?” He also saw study as a form of worship: “It’s a spiritual matter. It’s part of the quest of finding out what God will have you do with your life. ” Kimberly’s love of students and learning resulted in a teaching career that began at Oregon State University in the mid- 1970 s, included 18 years at Warner Pacific College, and culminated with his 25 -year commitment (17 full time) to George Fox.

40|$|Abstract This master thesis {{considers}} the strength {{analysis of the}} offshore wind turbine <b>s</b> <b>jacket</b> support structure with one structural member damaged or weakened, not capable of transferring the loads. A wind turbine and its substructure are usually exposed to environmental loadings (i. e. wind, waves) and described by computer simulations. FEDEM Windpower environment is used to analyse {{the model of the}} offshore wind turbine. Firstly, the thesis is to indicate the areas of the largest fatigue damage accumulation in the remaining structure members and to estimate their ultimate strength. The fatigue evaluation of the steel structure elements is based on the Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis. The steel brace member damage has been modelled by reducing the elastic modulus (Young's modulus) or inserting a free-joint mechanism {{in the middle of the}} element. Then the results of structure strength calculations before and after damage are collected and compared. Secondly, the analysis assumes a reduction in the fatigue loads applied to the support structure by changing the wind turbine control system. These changes are aimed at decreasing mainly the rotor revolution frequency and generator torque at the same time. The adjustment is achieved by varying a turbine blade pitch. The controller has also been modified to avoid continuous turbine operation at frequencies close to resonance...|$|R

U. <b>S.</b> <b>motorcyclists</b> are at relatively high risk of crashing, per mile travelled, with rates 24 times {{higher than those of}} passenger car and light-duty truck drivers. However, motorcycles require just one quarter the parking space of a car, and can double network capacities (in terms of vehicles per hour), thereby reducing congestion. While most motorcycles enjoy high fuel economy, their low seating capacities render them little or no better than most cars and some light-duty trucks (assuming average vehicle occupancies). They emit relatively fewer grams of CO 2, NOx, SO 2 and PM 10 per person-mile traveled than most cars, but more VOC and CO, if a catalytic converter is not installed. Noise impacts are also a serious issue for many motorcycles, with an inconsistent patchwork of regulations applied across states and localities.

40|$|Given Hovenkamp 2 ̆ 7 s {{influence}} and intellect, {{the publication of}} The Antitrust Enterprise is a major event, particularly since he sets out, {{according to the book}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>jacket,</b> to provide 2 ̆ 2 the first authoritative and compact exposition of antitrust law since Robert Bork 2 ̆ 7 s classic The Antitrust Paradox was published more than thirty years ago. 2 ̆ 2 Nevertheless, one could quibble with the jacket 2 ̆ 7 s claim. Richard Posner substantially updated his own authoritative and compact exposition of antitrust law in 2001. In a 2003 book review, Hovenkamp called Posner 2 ̆ 7 s second edition a 2 ̆ 2 marvelous and important book. 2 ̆ 2 So, before beginning a review of Hovenkamp 2 ̆ 7 s new work, it seems necessary to address the question of why we need another such treatment four years later. The answer is that Hovenkamp 2 ̆ 7 s goal is very different from that of Posner and Bork. Posner and Bork wrote what Hovenkamp calls 2 ̆ 2 polemical works 2 ̆ 2 against the prevailing antitrust regime (p. 37). In the 1970 s the prevailing regime was highly interventionist, suspicious of all manner of horizontal and vertical restraints and mergers, and intent on protecting small business from larger rivals, regardless of the cost to consumers. Bork and Posner 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 polemical 2 ̆ 2 works attacked the entire edifice of antitrust reasoning that had prevailed since {{the second half of the}} New Deal. By 2001, Posner had seen much of his revolutionary vision come to fruition, but his second edition retained its attacks on the Warren Court 2 ̆ 7 s antitrust policies just in case anyone was tempted to turn back the clock.

Until early 1990 <b>s,</b> concrete <b>jacketing</b> and steel were the two common methods adopted for strengthening the deficient RC Beam Column Joints. A new technique has emerged recently which uses fiber reinforced polymer sheet such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) sheets to strengthen the beam-column joint. Also, recent research has attempted to simulate the behavior of reinforced concrete structures strengthened with FRP composites using the finite element method (FEM). In the present study, finite element modeling of a RC exterior beam-column joint retrofitted with externally bonded FRP is carried out with the help of commercially available software ANSYS 13. 0. First, the control specimen is analyzed and the results obtained are compared with an experimental study from the literature. Then, the specimen is retrofitted with externally bonded glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets with different wrapping schemes and analyzed. The results from the retrofitted specimens are then compared with the results of the control specimen. It is found that for the control specimen, the values of the yield load and ultimate load obtained in the ANSYS are very close to the values obtained from the experimental study.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} wearing trend and {{purchase}} facts for adult females in their 20 s and 30 s {{along with their}} fitting satisfaction for woven jackets and circular knitted jackets. A questionnaire survey on consumers investigated satisfaction with jackets according to clothing materials and repair trend after wearing. Subsequently, a preference for cir-cular knitted jackets was shown higher than woven jackets. Females in their 20 <b>s</b> preferred woven <b>jackets</b> than those in their 30 s; however, the latter preferred circular knitted jackets than the former. For woven jackets, they showed the high-est satisfaction with size; however, for circular knitted jackets, they showed the highest satisfaction with fitting. In the question on their satisfaction by jacket part, satisfaction with circular knitted jackets was higher in all items except for bust measurement, bottom edge measurement, elbow circumference, shoulder width, and clothes length. Circular knitted jackets had lower repair rates than woven jackets and woven jackets had significant differences by age in satisfaction with back width. The research results indicate that females in their 20 s and 30 s who value fit preference and practicality will increasingly wear knit clothes. Therefore, we can address the fitting satisfaction requirement of females in their 20 s and 30 s by taking the clothing material properties of circular knitted clothes into consideration. In addition, further research is required on jacket patterns in consideration of clothing materials.

40|$|The {{documentary}} Tim Key and Gogol’s Overcoat {{is based}} on the short story The Overcoat by Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol. The Ukrainian-born Russian was one of the major authors of the 19 th century, who tried to demonstrate what Tsarist Russia entailed. The Overcoat, published in 1842, is a satire of the civil service and petty officialdom. It is about how an external object transforms a person 2 ̆ 7 s self-esteem and others 2 ̆ 7 opinions of a man of low rank. As the program unfolds, the boundaries between fact and fiction become more blurred, and the weave between St Petersburg and London, between Akaky Akakievich (protagonist of the story) and Tim Key (the documentary’s narrator) becomes tighter and tighter. Right from the start, Tim Key 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> own threadbare <b>jacket</b> becomes part of the documentary, used surprisingly and humorously, furthermore, in that it emphasises Key 2 ̆ 7 s personal relationship to Gogol and his short story. He takes a small, concrete thing, which is easy to follow dramaturgically, and places the other elements along this storytelling thread. The literary text counterpointed against Tim Key 2 ̆ 7 s narrator creates a fine contrast within the program; it is playful and with liberatingly little intellectual discussion of a great novella. The distinction between Gogol and Tim Key, between fact and fiction, becomes increasingly blurred. Steven Rajam manages to build up his program {{in such a way that}} everything gets its due pay-off as the program unfolds. To make people laugh is harder than making them cry. Tim Key and Gogol’s Overcoat is bolted together in an informal, surprising, smart and witty manner.

40|$|In {{the final}} essay {{of his most}} recent book, The Turn to the Native: Studies in Criticism and Culture, self-styled 2 ̆ 2 ethnocritic 2 ̆ 2 Arnold Krupat wonders aloud whether, through his interpretive activities, he hasn 2 ̆ 7 t become a 2 ̆ 2 leftist colonizer 2 ̆ 2 of the very sort critiqued so scathingly by Tunisian revolutionary theorist Albert Memmi {{more than three decades}} ago (p. 126). This worthy query, {{seemingly}} posed mainly as a rhetorical device allowing its author to absolve himself of the charge-he shortly concludes that simply by being 2 ̆ 2 someone who reads and writes about Native American literature 2 ̆ 2 he has made himself 2 ̆ 2 useful without vanity 2 ̆ 2 and is therefore merely 2 ̆ 2 a nice Jewish boy among the Indians 2 ̆ 2 (p. 130) -is plainly deserving of a deeper, less self-interested interrogation. Leaving aside the conundrum of personal vanity imbedded in the decision by any writer to publish an autobiographical piece, and the thoroughly begged question of the perspective from which Krupat 2 ̆ 7 s work might be judged useful (on the book 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> dust <b>jacket,</b> its publisher announces that The Turn to the Native has been 2 ̆ 2 long-awaited, 2 ̆ 2 but neglects to mention by whom or why), this thin volume contains no shortage of material upon which to base a more detached and scrupulous sort of analysis. A close reading of the overall text leads unerringly {{to an understanding of the}} author 2 ̆ 7 s sentiments radically at odds with the carefully- contrived air of innocence and good intentions he adopts toward its end. One need venture no further than the opening pages of the first essay, 2 ̆ 2 Criticism and Native American Literature, 2 ̆ 2 to appreciate both the magnitude of Krupat 2 ̆ 7 s anti-Indian bias and the lengths to which he is prepared to go in alternately defending and denying it. In this single twenty-nine page endeavor, he manages not only to 2 ̆ 2 debunk 2 ̆ 2 virtually every indigenous author who has lately contributed significantly to the field of literary/ cultural criticism-a roster extending alphabetically from Sherman Alexie to Robert Allen Warrior-but to align himself openly with positions assumed by many of the dominant society 2 ̆ 7 s worst appropriationists: Michael Castro, Sam Gill, Jerry Mander, and Werner Sollors, to name a few. 2 Along the way, he offers a tacit endorsement of such unabashedly Indian-hating diatribes as those compiled by James Clifton as The Invented Indian (p. 11), a collection with which he seems unfamiliar since he not only fails to cite it directly but seriously misstates the thrust of its major argument. 3 Ultimately, one is left with the distinct impression that there is hardly a white 2 ̆ 2 interpreter 2 ̆ 2 of Native America Krupat is not prepared to support in one way or several, scarcely an indigenous writer he is not prepared to manipulate, misrepresent, or degrade. Take, for example, his casual dismissal of several detailed native critiques of the material put forth by 2 ̆ 2 James Clifton, Werner Sollors, and Sam Gill, among others 2 ̆ 2 as 2 ̆ 2 ad hominem attacks. 2 ̆ 2 This cavalier and misleading depiction is offered on the very page where he opines, after barely a sentence of analysis and no quotations, that remarks critical of a 2 ̆ 2 prominent non-Native scholar 2 ̆ 2 made in 1992 by Lakota poet/essayist Elizabeth Cook-Lynn were 2 ̆ 2 racist 2 ̆ 2 (p. 11). 4 The Turn to the Native is littered from start to finish with similar polemical distortions...|$|R
