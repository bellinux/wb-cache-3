5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
25|$|Enrollment {{in public}} Part C health plans, {{including}} Medicare Advantage plans, grew from 5.4 million in 2005 to over 17 million in 2015. This represents almost 32% of <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Almost all <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> {{have access to}} at least two Medicare Advantage plans; most have access to three or more.|$|E

5000|$|With {{regard to}} IPAB's recommendations, {{the law says}} [...] "The {{proposal}} shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiary</b> premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiary</b> cost sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria." [...] The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must implement these proposals unless Congress adopts equally effective alternatives. The board is also required to submit to Congress annual reports on health care costs, access, quality, and utilization. IPAB must submit to Congress recommendations on how to slow the growth in total private health care expenditures.|$|R

We used data from the <b>Medicare</b> Current <b>Beneficiary</b> Survey (MCBS) and the Medicare Buy-In file. We found that 41 percent of QMB eligibles are enrolled in the program; participation is higher for poor and less educated beneficiaries, those in poorer health, rural residents, African-Americans, and Hispanics.

25|$|The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 {{made several}} changes to {{physician}} payments under Medicare. Firstly, it introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule, which took effect in 1992.

25|$|The 2003-law payment {{formulas}} purposely overcompensated some Part C plans by 12 {{percent or}} more on average compared to what Original <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> received in the same county on average, {{in order to increase}} the availability of Part C plans in rural and inner-city geographies. Before 2003 Part C plans tended to be suburban HMOs tied to major nearby teaching hospitals that cost the government the same as or even 5% less on average than it cost to cover the medical needs of a comparable beneficiary on Original Medicare.|$|E
25|$|Payment for {{physician}} services under Medicare {{has evolved}} {{since the program}} was created in 1965. Initially, Medicare compensated physicians based on the physician's charges, and allowed physicians to bill <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> the amount in excess of Medicare's reimbursement. In 1975, annual increases in physician fees were limited by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). The MEI was designed to measure changes in costs of physician's time and operating expenses, adjusted for changes in physician productivity. From 1984 to 1991, the yearly change in fees was determined by legislation. This was done because physician fees were rising faster than projected.|$|E
25|$|And on an {{absolute}} basis, based on Table II.B.1 and IV.C.1 of the 2016 Medicare Trustees report, in 2015 the Medicare Trustees spent 4% less on Medicare Advantage and other Part C beneficiaries per person {{than they did}} per person on <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> under FFS Medicare. In 2014 the difference in parity on {{an absolute}} basis was 2% less per person on Part C of Medicare based on the Medicare Trustees report in 2015. It appears that after using a formula that was too restrictive in 1997 when Part C was formalized and too generous in 2006 when Medicare +Choice became Medicare Advantage, the Trustees have now found a formula that delivers on the original cost-saving promise of Managed Medicare.|$|E

25|$|Both Canada and the United States {{have limited}} {{programs}} to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., {{the introduction of}} Medicare Part D has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some programs {{to help the poor}} and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists. About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers. In both countries, there is a significant population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada's and 40% of America's sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.|$|E
25|$|Coburn co-authored the Patients Choice Act of 2009 (S. 1099), a Republican {{plan for}} Health care {{reform in the}} United States, which in part 1) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convene an interagency {{coordinating}} committee to develop a national strategic plan for prevention. Provides for health promotion and disease prevention activities consistent with such plan. 2) Sets forth provisions governing the establishment and operation of state-based health care exchanges to facilitate the individual purchase of private health insurance {{and the creation of}} a market where private health plans compete for enrolles based on price and quality. 3) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. 4) Sets forth programs to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse, including ending the use of social security numbers to identify <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> 5) Terminates the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 payment {{formulas}} {{succeeded in}} increasing {{the percentage of}} rural and inner city poor that {{could take advantage of}} the OOP limit and lower co-pays and deductibles—as well as the coordinated medical care—associated with Part C plans. In practice however, one set of <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> received more benefits than others. The differences caused by the 2003-law payment formulas were almost completely eliminated by PPACA and have been almost totally phased out according to the 2013 MedPAC annual report, March 2013. One remaining special-payment-formula program—designed primarily for unions wishing to offer a Part C plan—is being phased out beginning in 2017. In 2015, on average a Part C beneficiary cost the Medicare Trust Funds 5% less than a beneficiary on traditional fee for service Medicare, completely reversing the situation in 2006 right after implementation of the 2003 law and restoring the capitated fee vs fee for service funding balance to its original intended level.|$|E

25|$|Romney named Representative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential {{running mate}} in August 2012. A year earlier, in June 2011, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives had passed a Republican {{alternative}} budget proposed by Ryan, with no Democrats voting for it. One controversial {{aspect of the}} proposal concerned Medicare; for those under age 55 as of its enactment, it would replace the existing Medicare {{system in which the}} government pays doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers fees for services rendered with a system in which the government would instead pay vouchers (also referred to as premium-support subsidies) to <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> who could then use their vouchers to either buy private medical insurance or to obtain coverage in a plan similar to traditional Medicare. Romney said that as president he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk, but he added that he would be putting forward his own plan before debating Obama.|$|E
25|$|Of the <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> {{who are not}} dual {{eligible}} for both Medicare (around 20%) and Medicaid or that do not receive supplemental insurance via a former employer (40%) or a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan (about 30%), almost all elect to purchase a type of private supplemental insurance coverage, called a Medigap plan (20%), to help fill in the financial holes in Original Medicare (Part A and B). Note that the percentages add up to over 100% because many beneficiaries {{have more than one}} type of supplement. These Medigap insurance policies are standardized by CMS, but are sold and administered by private companies. Some Medigap policies sold before 2006 may include coverage for prescription drugs. Medigap policies sold after the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006 are prohibited from covering drugs. Medicare regulations prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from being sold both a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan and a private Medigap Policy. As with public Part C health plans, private Medigap policies are only available to beneficiaries who are already signed up for benefits from Original Medicare Part A and Part B. These policies are regulated by state insurance departments rather than the federal government though CMS outlines what the various Medigap plans must cover at a minimum. Therefore, the types and prices of Medigap policies vary widely from state to state and the degree of underwriting, open enrollment and guaranteed issue also varies widely from state to state.|$|E

It would have eliminated the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and imposed a five-year spending freeze on all discretionary spending. [...] It would have also phased out Medicare's traditional fee-for-service model; instead it would have offered fixed sums {{in the form of}} vouchers for those under the age of 55, with which <b>Medicare</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> could buy private insurance. Ryan's proposed budget would also have allowed taxpayers to opt out of the federal income taxation system with itemized deductions, and instead pay a marginal tax rate 10 percent of adjusted gross income up to $100,000 for couples ($50,000 for singles) and 25 percent on any remaining income. It was ultimately rejected in the Democratic controlled House by a vote of 293–137, with 38 Republicans opposed.|$|E
