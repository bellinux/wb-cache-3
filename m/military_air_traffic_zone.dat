50|$|<b>Military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> (MATZ) are zones around <b>military</b> <b>air</b> {{bases in}} class G airspace. Military {{aircraft}} treat these {{as if they}} are controlled airspace; civilian traffic are advised but not obliged to do the same (although they must respect the ATZ contained within the MATZ). A MATZ usually consists of a circular zone with a radius of 5 nm, extending from the surface to 3000 ft AAL (above aerodrome level). Stubs 4 nm wide and 5 nm in length, orientated with the aerodrome's main runway, extend {{on opposite sides of the}} central circle, extending from 1000 ft to 3000 ft AAL.|$|R
