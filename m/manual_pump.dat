5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A <b>manual</b> <b>pump</b> was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

He developed a cerebellar hemorrhage after repetitive pressing of the shunt reservoir. The clinical manifestations, characteristic radiologic images, treatment outcome, and possible mechanisms of this late complication are presented. The risk of massive cerebrospinal fluid over-drainage after repetitive <b>manual</b> <b>pumping</b> of the V-P shunt reservoir, which {{can contribute to the}} formation of a cerebellar hemorrhage, warrants special attention and hydrocephalic patients and their caregivers should be informed and educated about this potential complication...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Manual</b> breast <b>pumps</b> are {{operated}} by squeezing or pulling a handle in a repetitive fashion, allowing {{the user to}} directly control the pressure and frequency of milk expression. [...] Though <b>manual</b> <b>pumps</b> are small and inexpensive, they can require significant effort and can be tiring because the user provides all the power. They also allow for only one breast to be pumped at a time. This style is recommended for infrequent usage such as when a woman is away from her baby for a single feeding. These pumps may not provide sufficient stimulation and emptying of the breast. It is recommended that [...] "bicycle horn" [...] style <b>manual</b> <b>pumps</b> not be used.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of a <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> with an ergonomic approach. This project is the further study of the previous project which is the preliminary design of the <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to prevent the musculoskeletal disorder problems among mothers who expressed the breast milk using <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump.</b> The objectives of this study is to design a <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> with ergonomics approach using Solidworks, to make a prototype of the designed <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> using Rapid Prototyping machine and to validate the designed <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> using simulation process and manual calculation. The scope of this project is that the developed <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> is only a prototype and is not readily functional as a commercial product. While the validations of the <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> through the simulation software is considered precise. The strategy of validation of finite element analysis was developed for this project. The finite element analysis was then performed using ALGOR and the bottle part of the design was analyzed using the static stress with linear material model. The other part of the design which is the pressure pump was also manually calculated. The obtained results indicate that the maximum value of the result shows in the bottom of the bottle due to the surface boundary condition. The manual calculation of the pressure pump shows that the design just can produce the maximum pressure of about 4, 000 Pa. While a good <b>manual</b> breast <b>pump</b> should produce at least about 2, 000 Pa. However the area is not suitable to be reducing in a great number due to the ergonomics condition...|$|R
