5|$|The grain {{trade was}} a {{profitable}} private enterprise {{during the early}} Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the equable <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> (also known as the ever-normal granary system) in 110 BC. The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue. The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57–75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD, when {{he believed that the}} government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.|$|E

25|$|When Malawi’s {{agricultural}} sector was liberalised, {{it was expected}} that the role of the parastatal ADMARC would be taken over by private traders, and that the private sector would create an efficient <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> that would stimulate the use of fertilizer and hybrid maize, which in turn would lead to expanded distribution networks. Liberalisation, it was hoped, would create an efficient and responsive private sector <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> that would stimulate agricultural production. In Malawi, the withdrawal of ADMARC from most areas contributed to widespread food insecurity among smallholder farmers, especially those in remote areas. To fill up the vacuum created following the withdrawal of ADMARC, the Ministry of Agriculture launched a development programme to train agro-dealers preferably rural shop owners. This started in 2001 with financial support from the USAID, but the programme had limited success as the majority of those trained ceased to be active agro-dealers within a few years of training, and most continuing agro-dealers were not rural based small-businessmen, as to start a successful dealing business required more capital than these possessed.|$|E

25|$|The {{black market}} also {{attracted}} an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began {{to institute a}} delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} Senegalese <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of {{liberalisation}} in 2002/03, there were only 180 ADMARC outlets. By 2009/10, the number of ADMARC-operated markets had grown to 788, and in 2010/11 the figure rose to 904. It remains {{under the control of}} politicians, and this has led to claims of corruption and the public perception that ADMARC does not act {{in the best interests of}} those it is meant to assist. ADMARC expanded in the decade after 2002 and still exists because of the failure of the agro-dealer programme to create an efficient private sector <b>marketing</b> <b>system.</b> This does not mean that ADMARC is efficient, it was heavily criticised in early 2013 for allowing stored grain to rot in its silos as many went hungry for lack of maize in ADMARC markets. Had that maize been released on the market before it spoiled, it was claimed, it would have helped to lower prices and prevented many having to queue for scarce maize.|$|E

25|$|The Fairtrade Foundation {{does not}} monitor {{how much of}} the extra money paid to the {{exporting}} cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching the Fairtrade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of Fairtrade, there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures are that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the <b>marketing</b> <b>system.</b> The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.|$|E

50|$|Chaos Theory {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos Theory applied to marketing offers an alternative explanation for the complex, apparently disorderly patterns of behavior in <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> over time which are observed in phenomena such as sales, inventories, brand shares and prices. <b>Marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are identified as being nonlinear in nature because they fail to satisfy the superposition principle (outputs are not directly proportional to inputs). Even though the rules governing behavior in <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are known, {{it is impossible to}} make accurate long-term predictions of system behavior due to the high sensitivity of initial conditions. This happens even though <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are fully deterministic. Traditional explanations of marketing phenomena typically rely on assumed patterns of external shocks, random noise or inherently stochastic processes to account for the complex dynamics within <b>marketing</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1979, {{the music}} {{industry}} in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed.

Gloria Gaynor argued that {{the music industry}} supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight. However, disco music remained relatively successful in the early 1980s, with big hits like Irene Cara's [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller", K.C. and the Sunshine Band's last major hit, [...] "Give It Up", and Madonna's first album had strong disco influences.

Queen's 1982 album, Hot Space was inspired by the genre as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation, or ADMARC, {{was formed}} in Malawi in 1971 as a Government-owned {{corporation}} or parastatal to promote the Malawian economy by increasing the volume and quality of agricultural exports, to develop new foreign markets for the consumption of Malawian agricultural produce and to supporting Malawi’s farmers. It was the successor {{of a number of}} marketing boards of the colonial-era and early post-colonial times, whose functions were as much about controlling African smallholders and generating government revenues as in promoting agricultural development. At its foundation, ADMARC was given the power to finance the economic development of any public or private organization. In its first decade of operation, ADMARC was considered to be more business-like and less bureaucratic than similar African parastatal bodies, but from its formation it was involved in the diversion of resources from smallholder farming to tobacco estates, often owned by members of the ruling elite. This led to corruption, abuse of office and inefficiency in ADMARC, and declining world tobacco prices made it insolvent by 1985. To obtain World Bank loans, ADMARC had to be partially privatised, but the neo-liberal economic policies imposed on it by the World Bank forced it to cut fertilizer subsidies and contributed to severe food shortages in 1992. Following the 1992 shortages, international aid donors demanded a return to multi-party politics by 1994 and President Banda who had ruled since 1964 was removed from office. In the aftermath of this change, ADMARC’s role was reduced to that of a buyer of last resort and of maintaining a strategic reserve of maize through domestic and foreign purchases to promote food security. [...] In 1996, the World Bank again intervened, criticising ADMARC’s importation of maize as an unjustified subsidy and requiring it to give up control of grain imports. ADMARC’s record of promoting food security and maintaining a strategic reserve from domestic purchases after 1996 was patchy: its intervention prevented a famine in 1998, but financial pressures in 2000 and 2001 forced it to sell much of its reserves just before a poor harvest in 2002, resulting in food shortages and famine. A third round of World Bank intervention in 2002 forced ADMARC to reduce its financial losses by reducing its trading operations and to allow private sector competition. This market liberalisation had mixed results: ADMARC survived it and by 2009 it was growing again. It still exists because it has not been possible to create a comprehensive private-sector <b>marketing</b> <b>system,</b> but it is criticised as inefficient and wasteful.|$|E
