500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: [...] "He just walked in and said, 'I have this new sound for you.' I think he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1971, American {{historian}} Erich Goldhagen {{published an}} article arguing that Speer was present for Himmler's speech. According to Fest in his biography of Speer, [...] "Goldhagen's accusation certainly {{would have been more}} convincing" [...] had he not placed supposed incriminating statements linking Speer with the Holocaust in quotation marks, attributed to Himmler, which were in fact invented by Goldhagen. In response, after considerable research in the German Federal Archives in Koblenz, Speer said he had left Posen around noon (long before Himmler's speech) to journey to Hitler's headquarters at Rastenburg. In Inside the Third Reich, published before the Goldhagen article, Speer recalled that on the evening after the conference, many Nazi officials were so drunk that they needed help boarding the special train which was to take them to a meeting with Hitler. One of his biographers, Dan van der Vat, suggests this necessarily implies he must have still been present at Posen then and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Himmler's speech. In response to Goldhagen's article, Speer had alleged that in writing Inside the Third Reich, he erred in reporting an incident that happened at another conference at Posen a year later, as happening in 1943. In 2007, The Guardian reported that a letter from Speer dated December 23, 1971, had been found in Britain in a collection of his correspondence to Hélène Jeanty, widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer states that he had been present for Himmler's presentation in Posen. Speer wrote: [...] "There is no doubt – I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed." ...|$|E

She <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> what I had done to Lauren because when I got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.' I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut her throat two or three times. This was across her throat. The knife was in my left hand. Nichole was sitting down when I cut her throat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presiding}} judge Asbjørn Nes Hansen {{wrote in}} his sentencing : [...] "Each of the victims {{has been subjected to}} the extreme burden of having been forced to listen to the other being raped while moaning in pain. Lena must have had thoughts about what would happen to her while Stine Sofie was being raped. After Lena was killed, Stine Sofie <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the defendants quarreling about who was going to kill her. Jan Helge Andersen explained that Stine Sofie took Lena's arm and later peered onto her. She probably understood at that time that Lena was dead. As the District Court has referred in its judgment, {{it is not possible to}} comprehend the fear and the suffering that the two girls went through before they finally died." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, Toulmin's {{daughter}} Jane drowned. In {{the face}} of this hardship and his longtime political persecutions, he stood strong. For example, during his ministry in Taunton at the Mary Street Unitarian Chapel, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. [...] I suppose you <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere (sic. Beer). [...] These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian,— there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hummel's {{influence}} {{can also}} be seen in the early works of Frédéric Chopin and Robert Schumann, and the shadow of Hummel's Piano Concerto in B minor as well as his Piano Concerto in A minor can be particularly perceived in Chopin's concertos. This is unsurprising, considering that Chopin <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Hummel on one of the latter's concert tours to Poland and Russia, and that Chopin kept Hummel's piano concertos in his active repertoire. Harold C. Schonberg, in The Great Pianists, writes [...] "...the openings of the Hummel A minor and Chopin E minor concertos are too close to be coincidental". In relation to Chopin's Preludes, Op. 28, Schonberg says: [...] "It also is hard to escape the notion that Chopin was very familiar with Hummel's now-forgotten Op. 67, composed in 1815 – a set of twenty-four preludes in all major and minor keys, starting with C major".|$|E
