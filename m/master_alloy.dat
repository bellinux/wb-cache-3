50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a green compact at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, golf club heads and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% dense Ti Grade 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V <b>master</b> <b>alloy.</b> The mechanical properties compare well with those exhibited by cast-and-wrought products.

For this reasons these composites {{are widely used}} in aerospace and automobile industries. In this work Scrap piston alloy was used as <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> because it contains silicon and magnesium. Silicon increases the casting ability and magnesium increases the wettability of alumina particles in <b>master</b> <b>alloy.</b> The desired composites were produced by the stir casting method by adding 5 %, 10 % and 15 % alumina particles in <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> respectively. For each of the composite alumina particles were preheated to a temperature of 800 °C for 2 hours. Then particles were added gradually into the molten <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> for achieving improved wettability and uniform distribution. The stirring was continued for 5 minutes. Finally composites ware poured into permanent metallic moulds at a temperature of 650 °C. The hardness and tensile strength of the composites were examined.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the metallic powder surface {{play a critical role}} in the development of strong bonds between particles during sintering, especially when introducing elements with a high affinity for oxygen. In this study, Mn and Si have been combined in a Fe–Mn–Si–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder in order to reduce their chemical activity and prevent oxidation during the heating stage of the sintering process. However, when this <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder is mixed with an iron base powder, differences in chemical activity between both components can lead to an oxygen transfer from the iron base powder to the surface of the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> particles. The present research is focused on studying the evolution of the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> particle surface during the early stages of sintering. Surface characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder surface is mostly covered by a thin easily reducible iron oxide layer (~ 1 nm).

40|$|The {{advantages}} of gamma TiAl-based alloys including their specific modulus, specific high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance make them attractive candidates as high-temperature structural {{materials in the}} automotive, aerospace and power industries. Currently most {{attention is paid to}} the alloys of the third and fourth generations. However, this type of alloys contains relatively high amounts of refractory metals such as Nb and Ta. The high melting points of these metals (2477 and 3017) °C are problematic for the preparation of these products with the conventional casting, because it is necessary to use higher temperatures and thus, generally, longer total melting times. This may result in increased oxygen amounts in the products and in decreased mechanical properties.
