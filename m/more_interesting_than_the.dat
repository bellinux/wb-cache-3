25|$|The String Sextet, {{entitled}} Souvenir de Florence, {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Piano Trio, better music intrinsically and better written. None of Tchaikovsky's other chamber works has a more positive opening, and the simplicity of the main section of the second movement is even more striking. After this very affecting music, the third movement progresses at least initially into a fresh, folksy world. Even more folksy is the opening of the finale, though Tchaikovsky takes this movement in a more academic direction with the incorporation of a fugue. This work has also been played in arrangements for string orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that {{did not like the}} direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E

500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} was aimed at its level of difficulty, which is {{higher than that of}} its predecessor; 1UP.com {{mentioned}} that this was most noticeable near the end {{of the game}}, where [...] "there are levels that consist of nothing but wave after wave of difficult enemies thrown at you to deplete your ammo, and then more waves of enemies after that." [...] GameSpy, however, praised this aspect of the game, saying that it made Going Commando <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original. Some reviewers also felt that the game's space combat was poorly done in comparison to the rest of the game, and that the [...] "Giant Clank" [...] levels were [...] "brainless and boring".|$|E

The second change was a reduction in distance between the third-last and second-last climbs: the distance was cut from [...] to , with a small unclassified climb also added. Cyclingnews.com described the first change as a [...] "much harder combination" [...] suggested that the new route would make the race <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 2014 edition, which it described as [...] "painfully dull".|$|E

500|$|The film is {{important}} as the first known character role by Lon Chaney. [...] Martin F. Norden, author of The Cinema of Isolation: A History of Physical Disability in the Movies, describes the plot as following the prevailing industry standards of disabled characters, where the figure [...] "nobly" [...] withdraws from the relationship after plotting revenge and then saving his beloved. Norden cites a quote from Chaney, saying this film made Chaney realize that [...] "the screen was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stage". The film is now considered lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, {{but if it was}} in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "It's quite a shock to discover that this confident, fully rounded episode {{was the first to}} be made. The perfect template." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that he [...] "thought 'Evening' was a reasonably good episode." [...] and added that [...] "Still, it’s an awkward piece, and not one I enjoyed a great deal. To be sure, 'Evening' was generally entertaining, but it's nothing special." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5. Another DVD review from The Digital Bits calls the behind the scenes story <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> actual episode.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the game's storyline was mixed. Although Shoemaker and Sliwinski praised its [...] "dark" [...] tone, Shoemaker {{found some}} story {{elements}} (such as Gollum's introduction) forced {{and designed to}} appeal to a particular audience. According to Game Informer Matt Miller, Shadow of Mordor fails to successfully tie together all of its various plot threads in the game's conclusion. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also found the storyline erratic, dragged down by anti-climactic fights and scenes. Dan Stapleton of IGN wrote that the story introduced memorable characters but would not make sense to fans of the series, and his interest in the game waned towards its end. Destructoid Chris Carter was disappointed in a plot he considered generic ("Go here, kill this, draw out this big bad, then kill him for your family"); the game failed to add anything new to the universe, and its side missions were <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Villoria also {{reviewed}} the Dreamcast version; {{he felt the}} CG sequences were [...] "great", and that the character animations were [...] "fluid" [...] and [...] "seamless". He also commented that the level designs were much <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions. Although Villoria thought the Dreamcast and PlayStation versions were very similar, he felt the Dreamcast version suffered in terms of gameplay since it did not feature special moves.|$|R

500|$|The strongest {{themes in}} Sherwood's early evangelical {{writings}} are {{the need to}} recognize one's innate [...] "depravity" [...] {{and the need to}} prepare oneself for eternity. For Sherwood, the most important lessons emphasize [...] "faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God." [...] In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678)—The Infant's Progress (1821)—she represents original sin as a child named [...] "In-bred Sin" [...] who tempts the young pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Celestial City (Heaven) and it is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, [...] "tedious" [...] for even the [...] "willing reader." [...] Thus, [...] "some young readers may have found [...] activities <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation." [...] Such religious allegory, although not always so overt, continued to be a favorite literary device [...] of Sherwood's.|$|E
500|$|Nick Setchfield of SFX {{gave the}} special {{four and a}} half out of five stars, writing that [...] "the power of emotion saves the day again" [...] was {{appropriate}} in light of the festivities and many fairytales referenced in the story. Setchfield was positive towards the [...] "terrific" [...] comedy with Strax, Coleman and the [...] "surprisingly underused" [...] Grant, as well as the new title sequence and TARDIS. While he wrote that the subtle callback of the Great Intelligence was [...] "a tad <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> usual 'So, we meet again!' schtick", he ultimately felt their threat [...] "never quite comes into sharp relief". Neela Debnath of The Independent wrote that [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was stronger than the previous year's [...] "The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe" [...] as it was connected to the overall story of the series, but [...] "still has a way to go if it is to live up to 'A Christmas Carol'". Despite feeling that it was [...] "enjoyable", she noted that [...] "the story feels truncated and rushed" ...|$|E
500|$|Robbins ranked {{seventh in}} a top ten list of gay {{characters}} on TV compiled by Jane Boursaw of TV Squad. Boursaw wrote: [...] "She's {{a mix of}} ironies - a pediatrician who glides around the hospital on wheelies, impulsively kisses Callie, then tells her she doesn't have time to teach a newbie how to be gay. Still, she's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other gays on this show, which are dwindling in numbers since Erica left for parts unknown." [...] Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for LGBT website AfterEllen.com observed of Robbins and Torres' relationship: [...] "I [...] can't help but be wary of how the Grey's writers will handle this relationship. Jessica has proven lovely and likable in her brief screen time so far. But it's not how the romance starts, but what happens next that really matters."

500|$|Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon {{received}} mostly negative reviews. Reviewers {{were mostly}} {{focused on the}} film's lacking plot and rampant cliché use. David Cornelius of DVD Talk described it as [...] "the kind of moronic C-level action flick that always stars some former martial arts champ", noting that the controversy behind the funding of the film was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> film itself, and finishing with the advice to skip the film. Albert Valentin of Kung Fu Cinema was less critical of the film, praising choreography and Mickey Hardt's performance in action sequences. Combustible Celluloid's Jeffrey M. Anderson gave the film a neutral-to-positive review, mentioning [...] "the overall ridiculousness of the film charmed [...] ", and commenting positively on the chemistry between Hardt's and Krupa's characters. Gene Park of Guam's Pacific Daily News was, however, jarred by inaccuracies in the plot. He called the film a [...] "guilty pleasure without the pleasure." [...] He thought the action editing was [...] "epileptic" [...] and compared the whole film to a travelogue. As of 2015, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes counts one positive and one negative review of the film.|$|E
500|$|Destructoid's Carter {{thought that}} Delsin {{was a more}} {{interesting}} protagonist than [...] "wooden" [...] Cole, which helped his investment into the story. IGN's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character, especially because of the chemistry with Reggie. He found Troy Baker's performance of Delsin [...] " [...] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey [...] or overwrought". However, he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward. Although calling the characters clichéd, Edge {{felt that they were}} written and acted well. GameSpot's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature, and found the gameplay <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> [...] "tired" [...] story. Eurogamer's Welsh considered the plot driven by [...] "inconsequential MacGuffins" [...] and thought the ending rushed, but praised the story for not stretching on too long. Polygon's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security-over-freedom well enough, such that its impact was diminished. He was overall disappointed with the narrative, despite finding the main characters written better than in previous Infamous games. OPM's Meikleham was put off by Delsin's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story, but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances.|$|E

[...] Dave Barry from The Miami Herald commented that although You Can Dance sounds like [...] "old Madonna", [...] "Spotlight" [...] sounds surprisingly fresh to his ears. Joe Brown from The Washington Post commented that the song {{should have been a}} [...] "flat reject". Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "exuberant". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that [...] " [...] is an attractive package for dance fans—particularly with the inclusion of a new cut, 'Spotlight'". He went on to add that the [...] "lyrics of 'Spotlight' aren't great, but they're still <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> others. Still, the words, like those of most dance songs, are just window dressing that's secondary to the beat. The big attraction of 'Spotlight' is a long, hard-driving, closing passage that's guaranteed to turn dancers on." [...] Jan DeKnock, while writing for Orlando Sentinel, noted that the song was already receiving airplay from radio stations.|$|E
