5000|$|Carbon dioxide binds to {{metals in}} only a few ways. The bonding mode depends on the electrophilicity and {{basicity}} of the metal centre. [...] Most common is the η2-CO2 coordination mode as illustrated by Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2, which was the first reported complex of CO2. This square-planar compound is a derivative of Ni(II) with a reduced CO2 ligand. In rare cases, CO2 binds to metals as a Lewis base through its oxygen centres, but such adducts are weak and mainly of theoretical interest. A variety of <b>multinuclear</b> complexes are also known often involving Lewis basic and Lewis acidic metals, e.g. metallacarboxylate salts (C5H2)Fe(CO)2CO2−K+. In <b>multinuclear</b> cases (compounds containing more than one metal), more complicated and more varied coordination geometries are observed. One example is the unsymmetrical compound containing four rhenium centres, (CO)5ReCO2Re(CO)42. Carbon dioxide can also bind to ligands on a metal complex (vs just the metal), e.g. by converting hydroxy ligands to carbonato ligands.|$|E

50|$|Sipunclans do {{not have}} a {{vascular}} blood system. Fluid transport and gas exchange are instead accomplished by the coelom, which contains the respiratory pigment haemerythrin, and the tentacular system. The coelomic fluid contains five types of coelomic cells: haemocytes, granulocytes, large <b>multinuclear</b> cells, ciliated urns and immature cells. The ciliated urn cells may also be attached to the peritoneum and assist in waste filtering from the interstitial fluid. Nitrogenous waste is excreted through a pair of metanephridia opening close to the anus, except in Phascolion and Onchnesoma, which have only a single nephridium. A ciliated funnel, or nephrostome, opens into the coelomic cavity at the anterior end, close to the nephridiopore.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} vinyl cation, C2H3+, {{which is}} unsubstituted, can have two possible structures, a classical linear or a non-classical bridged structure. Ab initio calculations {{have shown that}} the bridged structure is more stable than the classical by 5.0 kcal/mole. But for substituted vinyl cations with equivalent alkyl groups, the linear structure is supported by 13C and 1H NMR. The first experimental evidence of the linear structure of vinyl cations was the x-ray structure of b-silyl vinyl cations. Using <b>multinuclear</b> NMR spectroscopy, the compound exhibited a single 29Si NMR signal which implies that the two Si are equivalent and delocalize to the carbocation through hyperconjugation. The vinyl cation has an intense IR peak at 1987 cm−1 for the C=C+ stretching. More importantly, the bond angles between the vinyl cation carbons and the first carbon of the alkyl substituted was measured to be approximately 180o.|$|E
50|$|Phycomyces {{have two}} mating types that are indistinguishable morphologically. The sexual cycle {{is thought to}} occur by the {{following}} steps. Two hyphae of different mating type encounter each other, and their tips undergo a septation event to produce gametangia. Gametangia are haploid <b>multinuclear</b> cells equivalent to gametes. The two gametangia fuse to form an immature zygospore. Initially the developing zygospore contains thousands of nuclei contributed by the gametangia. During the course of zygospore maturation and dormancy, lasting several months, most nuclei are degraded. It is thought that ordinarily two surviving nuclei, one from each parent, fuse to form a diploid cell which then undergoes meiosis to form haploid meiotic products. These then reproduce by mitotic divisions leading {{to the formation of}} a sporangium structure (germosporangium) that develops out from the zygospore. The germosporangium contains spores (germspores) that have one to six haploid nuclei like those in the vegetative sporangium.|$|E
50|$|A {{primary focus}} of the {{research}} in the Bryant laboratory is of information obtainable from the magnetic relaxation dispersions (MRD) or from the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate {{as a function of}} the magnetic field strength. The unique instrumentation, constructed in the Bryant Lab, permits acquisition of MRD profiles for a variety of nuclear resonances in high resolution. The collected MRD profiles report relative inter and intramolecular motions over the time range from about ten microseconds to one picosecond. The measurements are sensitive to relatively weak intermolecular interactions and permit definition of highly localized intermolecular free energy differences in solutions. <b>Multinuclear</b> studies of proteins in a number of dynamical environments provide a fundamental characterization of how the protein structure fluctuates in time and how energy is redistributed in the folded structure. The practical implications range from understanding protein catalytic function to developing new techniques for diagnostic medicine in the context of magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.|$|E
50|$|During its lifespan, Amoebophyra {{alternates}} {{between a}} free-swimming stage called the dinospore, and a <b>multinuclear</b> growth phase within the host called the trophont stage. A dinospore will {{attach to the}} host (biology) cell’s outer surface, then enter the cytosol. Most infections proceed within the nucleus, though some stay within the cytoplasm. Within ten minutes, the parasite {{makes it to the}} host’s nuclear envelope and significantly increases in size during the next twenty-four hours. Hosts infected by certain strains of Amoebophyra such as Amoebophyra ceratii cannot reproduce before the parasite completes its life cycle and kills the host. It will continue to increase in size through nuclear divisions without the need for cytokinesis, resulting in a beehive appearance within the host. Afterwards, Amoebophyra grows to become mobile like a worm, but soon separates into dinospores. These new dinospores then have {{a short amount of time}} to find new hosts since their survival time in water is meager. Of course, the success and efficiency of the infection can be greatly affected by the nutrient environment. The environment can greatly affect the success of Amoebophyra, as a nutrient environment can influence its reproductive ability as well as their offsprings’ infectivity.|$|E
5000|$|Pepstatin is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of aspartyl proteases. It is a hexa-peptide containing the unusual amino acid statine (Sta, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), having the sequence Isovaleryl-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta). [...] It was originally isolated from cultures of various species of Actinomyces due to its ability to inhibit pepsin at picomolar concentrations. Pepstatin A is well known to be an inhibitor of aspartic proteinases such as pepsin, cathepsins D and E. Except for {{its role as a}} proteinase inhibitor, however, the pharmacological action of pepstatin A upon cells remain unclear. Pepstatin A suppresses receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Pepstatin A suppresses the formation of <b>multinuclear</b> osteoclasts dose-dependently. This inhibition of the formation only affected osteoclast cells, i.e., not osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, pepstatin A also suppresses differentiation from pre-osteoclast cells to mononuclear osteoclast cells dose-dependently. This inhibition seems to be independent of the activities of proteinases such as cathepsin D, because the formation of osteoclasts was not suppressed with the concentration that inhibited the activity of cathepsin D. Cell signaling analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in pepstatin A-treated cells, while the phosphorylation of IκB and Akt showed almost no change. Furthermore, pepstatin A decreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). These results suggest that pepstatin A suppresses the differentiation of osteoclasts through the blockade of ERK signaling and the inhibition of NFATc1 expression.|$|E
50|$|From spectroscopic data, it {{has been}} shown that Cr3+ binds tightly to chromodulin (Kf = 1021 M−4), and that the binding is highly {{cooperative}} (Hill Coefficient = 3.47). It has been shown that holochromodulin binds 4 equivalents of Cr3+. Evidence for this comes from in vitro studies which showed that apochromodulin exerts its maximal activity on insulin receptors when titrated with 4 equivalents of Cr3+. Chromodulin is highly specific for Cr3+ as no other metals are able to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. It is believed to stimulate the phosphorylation of the 3 tyrosine residues of the β subunits of the insulin receptor. From electronic studies, the crystal field stabilization energy was determined to be 1.74 x 103 while the Racah parameter B was 847 cm−1. This indicates that chromium binds to chromodulin in the trivalent form. In addition, magnetic susceptibility studies have shown that chromium does not coordinate to any N-terminal amine groups but rather to carboxylates (although the exact the amino acids involved are still unknown). These magnetic susceptibility studies are consistent with the presence of a mononuclear Cr3+ center and an unsymmetric trinuclear Cr3+ assembly with bridging oxo ligands. In chromodulin isolated from bovine liver, x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have shown that the chromium (III) atoms are surrounded by 6 oxygen atoms with an average Cr—O distance of 1.98 Å, while the distance between 2 chromium (III) atoms is 2.79 Å. These results are indicative of a <b>multinuclear</b> assembly. No sulfur ligands coordinate to chromium and instead, {{it has been}} proposed that a disulfide linkage between 2 cysteine residues occurs owing to a characteristic peak at 260 nm.|$|E
