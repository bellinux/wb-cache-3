LayTracks combines {{the merits of}} two popular direct techniques for quad mesh generation - Quad meshing by decomposition and Advancing front quad meshing. The algorithm uses the <b>MAT</b> to <b>lay</b> rails across an arbitrary set of connected planar patches. Each rail starts from a node on the boundary and propagates towards the MA and then from the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track formed by adjacent rails. Spacing between the rails and between the nodes on the rails are xed at the boundary of the region. The medial axis therefore serves as the natural termination for the propagation of both the rail and the mesh. The algorithm uses the medial axis transform to both decompose the region and avoid the expensive interference checks of advancing [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{verandah}} there was a round table. On it a paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three inner sides. The fourth side was open, and faced the river. Between the rough supports of the high-pitched roof hung torn rattan screens. There was no ceiling, and the harsh brilliance of the lamp was toned above into a soft half- light that lost itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters. The front wall was cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red curtain. The women's room opened into that passage, which led to the back courtyard and to the cooking shed. In one of the side walls there was a doorway. Half obliterated words--"Office: Lingard and Co."--were still legible on the dusty door, which {{looked as if it had}} not been opened for a very long time. Close to the other side wall stood a bent- wood rocking-chair, and by the table and about the verandah four wooden armchairs straggled forlornly, as if ashamed of their shabby surroundings. A heap of common <b>mats</b> <b>lay</b> in one corner, with an old hammock slung diagonally above. In the other corner, his head wrapped in a piece of red calico, huddled into a shapeless heap, slept a Malay, one of Almayer's domestic slaves--"my own people," [...] he used to call them. A numerous and representative assembly of moths were holding high revels round the lamp to the spirited music of swarming mosquitoes. Under the palm-leaf thatch lizards raced on the beams calling softly. A monkey, chained to one of the verandah supports--retired for the night under the eaves--peered and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the bamboo roof sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried leaves to settle on the shabby table. The floor was uneven, with many withered plants and dried earth scattered about. A general air of squalid neglect pervaded the place. Great red stains on the floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate betel-nut chewing. The light breeze from the river swayed gently the tattered blinds, sending from the woods opposite a faint and sickly perfume as of decaying flowers.|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{breeding}} in seasonal environments {{are under}} strong selection to time reproduction to match offspring demand {{and the quality}} of the post-natal environment. Timing requires both the ability to accurately interpret the appropriate environmental cues, and the flexibility to respond to inter-annual variation in these cues. Determining which cues are linked to reproductive timing, what these cues are predicting and understanding the fitness consequences of variation in timing, is therefore of paramount interest to evolutionary and applied ecologists, especially in the face of global climate change. We investigated inter-annual relationships between climatic variation and the timing of reproduction in Canada’s largest breeding population of Arctic common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in East Bay, Nunavut. Warmer spring temperatures predicted both earlier mean annual laying dates and the earlier ice-free conditions required by ducklings for post-natal growth. Warmer springs had higher variation in this temperature cue, and the population <b>laying</b> <b>distribution</b> became increasingly positively-skewed in warmer summers, potentially indicating that more low-quality females had the opportunity to commence laying in warmer years. Females that timed laying to match duckling hatching just prior to fully ice-free conditions obtained the highest duckling survival probability. Inter-annual data on repeated breeding attempts revealed that the individuals examined show a similar degree of laying flexibility in response to climatic variation; however, there was significant individual variation in the absolute timing of laying within an average year. This work sheds light on how reproductive timing is related to and influenced by variation in local climate and provides vital information on how climate-related variation in reproductive timing influence a fitness measure in an Arctic species. Results are especially relevant to future work in polar environments given that global climatic changes are predicted to be most intense at high latitudes...|$|R

The rate is even lower in rural areas {{where most of the}} population in these countries lives. One of the main obstacles to rural electrification (RE) is the high cost of <b>laying</b> the <b>distribution</b> infrastructure owing to the dispersed nature of loads and low demand. Thus, electrifying the rural areas needs to be considered holistically and not just on the financial viability. To reduce cost, it is important that un-conventional rural electrification (URE) technologies, which are cheaper than the conventional ones be explored. Un-conventional rural electrification (URE) technologies have been tried successfully {{in some parts of the}} world. However, the literature review showed that no work had so far been done with regard to maximum penetration level of these technologies on power transmission networks, especially the Capacitor Coupled Substation (CCS) and Auxiliary Service Voltage Transformers (ASVTs). These two technologies have the ability to tap power directly from high voltage transmission lines and convert it to distribution level single or three phase supply for the purpose of rural electrification.

Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} organizations reduce errors as much as possible. However, organizations cannot effectively reduce errors until they understand the factors that determine and influence them and can isolate the sources of those errors. Product <b>distribution</b> at Frito <b>Lay</b> is very critical in the supply chain activities of the company and understanding and managing the level of errors that occur at the distribution phase of operations is critical for the firm’s long term sustained competitiveness. This study examines Frito Lay’s order filling processes and how order volumes affect the level of errors. The company uses two types of order picking technologies: prepick and bulk order, conventionally also known as pick-to-light and voice-pick technology respectively. The main objectives of the study are: (a) to examine the impact of size of volume processed at the distribution center on errors recorded for each order pick technology and (b) the impact of regional and seasonal differences across Frito <b>Lay’s</b> <b>distribution</b> network. The data pertaining to pre-pick volume, pre-pick error, bulk volume and bulk error were collected for ten consecutive quarters time period ranging from first quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2011 and across 16 divisional distribution centers in four regions of the U. S. The data were organized into a panel for analyses using Stata® 12. 1. With no a priori foundation for choosing any particular structural equation form, a number of structural equations were estimated and compared to consistency with economic theory and internal consistency. Two different sets of models were estimated: one for each technology. The regression results from the analysis from the pre-pick order picking technology models showed the quadratic model was the “best” model, whereas the linear model {{turned out to be the}} “best” structural form for bulk order picking system. This research provides valuable information to management in attempt to address errors in the order fulfillment system. Because errors may be human, and these human errors may emanate from lack of knowledge or poor skills, they can be addressed with training and education. The human errors may also be a result of processes in the plant. These could be addressed by the reconfiguration of processes and educating people about those processes. Finally, the errors may be motivational, leading to poor focus in executing responsibilities. To address these types of errors, management may choose to implement both positive and negative incentives. Positive incentives will provide rewards to employees who meet error reduction targets that are established at the beginning of certain periods. Negative incentives may include penalties for exceeding pre-specified error thresholds. The Frito Lay system would benefit more from this research if the data had included human resource demographic data as well as economic information. It would have allowed the research to estimate the effect of errors on the economic performance of the different distribution centers and help determine the economically optimal level of errors at the different centers...|$|R

The paper also compares the restricted market with broader instruments by including all sectors. The results obtained show that the costs of reaching the objects set by the EU for Spain are of little significance.

We set out some elements regarding nature, scale, significance and impact of the mobility of this population of prolific inventors. In particular the paper suggests an analysis that measures the effects on mobility on individual inventive productivity {{and the value of}} invention. We call “prolificness ” the capacity to accumulate knowledge and experience through mobility (that is to say through their capital of contacts and interactions). The first goal {{of this paper is to}} survey the literature dealing with the category of prolific inventor. It is a piece of a larger research project that aims to assess the mobility of this population of prolific by measuring its effect on the individual inventive productivity and the value of invention (see footnote 1). As a consequence we survey the literature on inventor mobility 2 as well. In the last part we give some insight on what we call “The Economics of prolificness”. 1. Literature Survey on prolific inventors a. The precursors. In the literature there are three basic references. First the well-known seminal study of Lotka (1926). He observes that the number of highly productive scientists was a relatively small fraction of all scientists. Acknowledging that a population of highly prolific inventors does exist, he suggests a law for <b>laying</b> out their <b>distribution.</b> Secondly, the study from Levine (1986) analysing the statistical distribution of a bulk of patents from a sample of 7392 inventors who received 9 patents or more under the time period 1975 - 1984. He observes the frequency distribution of patent output per inventor revealing “an 1 The research has been funded by ANR (project n ° 06 -APPR- 002 - 001...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 47). RobiAxiata Limited is the third largest telecommunication service provider in Bangladesh and, over time, it is steadily increasing its customer base and number of subscribers. In order to do so, Robi has to constantly increase its investment prospects to get an ideal return on invested capital. The decision to invest and which areas would provide the greatest return and least risk is crucial and must be made with care. So, Robi has to constantly analyze its potential and in which investment areas {{it is wise to}} deploy its Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Previously, the system of CAPEX <b>distribution</b> <b>lay</b> solely in the control of the Market Operations and Technology. Market Operations would routinely send monthly demand forecast to the Technology division. The Technology department would then assess the areas where new technology is required or a new BTS implementation is required to send a budget requirement form to the Integrated Planning department of the Finance division. The finance division would then send the required CAPEX. The CAPEX deployed to these areas would be done without any intervention from the Finance department {{and there would be no}} financial calculations conducted, such as calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) or the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of these investment prospects. Thus, there was no way to calculate the required rate of return (RRR) of these projects and whether they will generate a net profit anytime soon. As a result, it was seen that, despite the large amounts of CAPEX deployed in these areas, there weren’t any profits being accumulated and the CAPEX was being tied down in loss generating investments.
