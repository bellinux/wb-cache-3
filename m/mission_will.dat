5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his spotter {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be {{considered}} a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|The Little Busters {{will also}} {{participate}} in missions to accomplish some goal, and a <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> either be completed or failed {{depending on the}} choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The {{first time that the}} game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E
40|$|The three {{remaining}} Apollo <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> {{have significantly}} increased scientific capabilities. These result from increased payload, {{more time on}} the surface, improved range, and more sophisticated experiments on the surface and in orbit. Landing sites for the last three <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be carefully selected to maximize the total scientific return...|$|R
40|$|Future {{exploration}} <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> require NASA {{to integrate}} more automation and robotics {{in order to}} accomplish mission objectives. This presentation will describe on the future challenges facing the human operator (astronaut, ground controllers) as we increase the amount of automation and robotics in spaceflight operations. It will describe how future exploration <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> have to adapt and evolve {{in order to deal with}} more complex missions and communication latencies. This presentation will outline future human-automation-robotic integration challenges...|$|R
50|$|In 2020, the 6 cargo <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be {{launched}} in close succession, {{consisting of two}} living units, two life-support units, and two supply units.|$|R
25|$|There may {{be several}} key terrain {{features}} {{in an area}} of operation, however, not every <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> have decisive terrain.|$|E
25|$|The ISRO {{plans to}} send a follow up mission to its Mars Orbiter Mission in the 2021–2022 timeframe; it is called Mangalyaan 2. This <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> consist of a lander and {{possibly}} a rover.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2017, the United Nations Security Council {{announced}} that the <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> end in October 2017. It is set {{to be replaced by}} a follow-up mission: the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH), which is expected to have just under 1,300 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The mission's planet finding {{component}} {{was set up}} {{to serve}} as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. SIM Lite was to perform an important task that these <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the SIM was envisioned to perform for the future <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets SIM has detected.|$|R
50|$|More quests and <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> {{be added}} to S.U.N. to {{continue}} the ongoing story. Additionally, when a mission is near completion, tips will appear for readers to unlock hidden missions.|$|R
50|$|Option 1: The {{participant}} {{can return}} to their normal life, never having to be summoned by Gantz again. As a price, their memories of Gantz and the <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be erased.|$|R
25|$|The Kepler {{mission is}} NASA's first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets. The Kepler <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> monitor the {{brightness}} of stars to find planets that pass {{in front of them}} during the planets' orbits. During such passes or 'transits,' the planets will slightly decrease the star's brightness.|$|E
25|$|On 10 Nov 2014, China {{unveiled}} a prototype {{model of a}} Mars rover based on its lunar rover Yutu at an annual air show at Zhuhai. The CASC also said that a mission including an orbiter, lander and the rover (2020 Chinese Mars <b>Mission)</b> <b>will</b> be sent in 2020.|$|E
25|$|Mission objective: As {{part of the}} Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP) led by ESA {{to cover}} primary {{research}} objectives, the EarthCARE <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be the third Earth Explorer Core Mission. The <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be implemented in collaboration with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency who will provide one of the core instruments. The EarthCARE mission has been specifically defined with the basic objective of improving the understanding of cloud-aerosol-radiation interactions so as to include them correctly and reliably in climate and numerical weather prediction models. EarthCARE will meet these objectives by measuring simultaneously the vertical structure and horizontal distribution of cloud and aerosol fields together with outgoing radiation over all climate zones. SSTL's role in this mission {{is to provide a}} Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) Instrument by development, manufacturing, testing and operations support during Phase B/C/D/E1.|$|E
50|$|Astronauts on {{deep space}} <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> not have Earth's protections so {{understanding}} {{the factors that}} may affect their exposure to cosmic rays and the solar wind is critical to manned space exploration.|$|R
50|$|Investigations {{characterized}} by definition, development, mission operations, and data analysis costs {{not to exceed}} $15.0M (real year dollars) total cost to NASA. UNEX <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be launched {{by a variety of}} low cost methods.|$|R
50|$|Money {{and points}} can be earned by {{completing}} missions. Money and points {{can also be}} lost if the player does not complete a mission or too late. <b>Missions</b> <b>will</b> take points from the player after a set amount of time {{from the start of}} the mission while it remains uncompleted. Some <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> eventually be canceled resulting in a point loss or will not reward anything after completion. Missions like MEDEVAC or firefighting <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> result in large penalties if the victim dies or if the area gets destroyed by the fire. When the player has accumulated enough points, the game lets them move on to the next city. The player then has a choice of going into a new city of the same difficulty or advancing to the next level. There are twelve levels of difficulty, with new types of jobs being introduced and previous types of jobs increasing in difficulty. Jobs will be randomly spawned around the city, but the player's actions can also create jobs (see below).|$|R
25|$|The <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> {{complement}} ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer launching in 2022, {{which will}} fly-by Europa twice and Callisto multiple times before moving into orbit around Ganymede. Launching {{around the same}} time as the Europa Clipper, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will have a cruise phase some three times as long.|$|E
25|$|The enemy AI has {{improved}} {{in terms of}} situational awareness. If players frequently use particular weapons or tactics to subdue enemy soldiers, repeats of the <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> see the enemy increase in numbers and be outfitted with better equipment; for example, the frequent use of headshots will see enemy soldiers don metal helmets to make targeting the head harder.|$|E
25|$|The band {{continued}} to tour {{in support of}} Another Fall from Grace into 2017. The tour culminated in a headline set at Wave Gotik Treffen. Shortly after this, Wayne Hussey announced via Facebook that the band would be taking a break with no definite plans {{in place for the}} near future. The <b>Mission</b> <b>will</b> support Alice Cooper in November 2017; their last shows for the time being.|$|E

25|$|In October 2015, {{with the}} {{approval}} of the Cameroonian government, the U.S. military deployed 300 personnel to Cameroon, their primary <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> revolve around providing intelligence support to local forces as well as conducting reconnaissance flights.|$|R
25|$|ExoMars {{goals are}} {{to search for}} signs of past life on Mars, {{investigate}} how the Martian water and geochemical environment varies, investigate atmospheric trace gases and their sources and by doing so demonstrate the technologies for a future Mars sample return mission. The <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> search for ancient biosignatures of Martian life, employing several spacecraft elements {{to be sent to}} Mars on two launches.|$|E
25|$|Next funded earth {{observation}} mission after GOSAT is the GCOM (Global Change Observation Mission) earth observation programme {{as a successor}} to ADEOS II (Midori) and the Aqua mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, GCOM-W (Shizuku) was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The launch of the second satellite, GCOM-C is currently planned for 2017.|$|E
25|$|As {{the joint}} AFBiH began to develop, troops {{began to be}} sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina {{deployed}} a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel {{as part of the}} Multinational force in Iraq. The unit was first deployed to Fallujah, then Talil Air Base, and is now located at Camp Echo. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be to protect/guard Camp Victory in Baghdad.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} review {{potential}} power system concepts {{for the development}} of the lunar outpost including power generation, energy storage, and power management and distribution (PMAD). In particular, the requirements of the initial robotic <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be discussed and the technologies considered will include cryogenics and regenerative fuel cells (RFC), AC and DC transmission line technology, high voltage and low voltage power transmission, conductor materials of construction and power beaming concepts for transmitting power to difficult to access locations such as at the bottom of craters. Operating conditions, component characteristics, reliability, maintainability, constructability, system safety, technology gaps/risk and adaptability for future lunar <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be discussed for the technologies considered...|$|R
5000|$|No law {{of physics}} or biology forbids cheap travel and {{settlement}} {{all over the}} solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> start sometime late in the twenty-first century.Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the game}} was {{originally}} planned to be multiplayer only, a single player mode will be added in an update planned for Summer 2017, despite the stretch goal for [...] to unlock it not being reached. The mode will consist of objective-based <b>missions</b> that <b>will</b> allow the player {{to take control of}} Jason against offline camp counselor bots. Some of the <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> be adaptations of the films, while others are original scenarios.|$|R
25|$|On 21 May 2012 {{the leaders}} of the NATO-member {{countries}} endorsed an exit strategy during the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago. The NATO-led ISAF Forces will hand over command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013, while shifting at the same time from combat to a support role of advising, training and assisting the Afghan security forces and then withdraw most of the 130,000 foreign troops by the end of December 2014. A new and different NATO <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> then advise, train and assist the Afghan security forces including the Afghan Special Operations Forces.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the plan}} has gained little {{traction}} among member states. The UN did not require that {{the remainder of the}} funds allocated to the MINUSTAH be repurposed for Cholera reparations, which resulted in many member nations taking back their contributions. As of July 2017, the UN had raised just $9.22 million of the promised $400 million total. Advocates have voiced their displeasure with these results, and the public outcry has grown more forceful as of late; The UN has announced the MINUSTAH <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> be ending in October 2017, and many are calling for the new approach to be funded {{by the time of the}} mission's departure.|$|E
25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital {{astrobiology}} experiment by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The <b>mission</b> <b>will</b> collect cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E

40|$|Future human space {{exploration}} <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> lengthen to years, and keeping crews clothed without a huge resupply burden {{is an important}} consideration for habitation systems. A space laundry system could be the solution; however, the resources it uses must be accounted for and must win out over the reliable practice of simply bringing along enough spare underwear. NASA has conducted trade-off studies through its Logistics Reduction Project to compare current space clothing systems, life extension of that clothing, traditional water-based clothes washing, and other sanitizing techniques. The best clothing system depends on the mission and assumptions but, in general, analysis results indicate that washing clothes on space <b>missions</b> <b>will</b> start to pay off as mission durations approach a year...|$|R
