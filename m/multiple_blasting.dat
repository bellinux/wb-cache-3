50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after wet blasting are extremely clean, there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the blasted surface. Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of wet blasting or dry blasting because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for <b>multiple</b> <b>blasting</b> operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|E

It was found that the best model was as a function of the blasting layout and the initial soil conditions represented by the SPT (N₁) ₆₀ blow counts and the effective overburden pressure, σ’[subscript v 0], expressed in kPa. The model was evaluated on case history data and it was found to be valid for blasting layouts that are relatively simple (i. e. square grid or circular array with less than 30 charges), but became unreliable for complex blasting layouts consisting of many charges (more than 30) or erratic blasting patterns. In addition, it was found that the model was statistically acceptable to be used for single blasts as well. The new empirical model estimates the extent of liquefaction and residual pore pressure for both single and <b>multiple</b> <b>blasts</b> and can be used in design of future blasting studies. Although the empirical model has yet to be validated from experimental field tests, it is anticipated that this model could be a step in the development of energy-based design for assessing liquefaction potential and in performing ground improvement evaluations.

Due the severity of these issues and the need of data required for a safety design, more research is required about explosions and shock waves. This paper presents an assessment of blast wave overpressures using a computational fluid dynamics software. Analyses of phenomena as reflection of shock waves and channeling effects were done and a comparison between numerical results and analytical predictions has been executed, based on the simulation on several models. The results suggest that the common analytical predictions aren’t accurate enough for an overpressure analysis in small stand-off distances and that poorly designed buildings may increase the shock wave overpressures due <b>multiple</b> <b>blast</b> wave reflections, increasing the destructive potential of the explosions...|$|R

These results suggest that the NBS-LRR genes identified in the growth chamber may be more effective against single blast strains than against <b>multiple</b> <b>blast</b> strains. Under blast nurseries conditions, in contrast, the specific NBS-LRR R genes are difficult to detect because of the diversity of M. oryzae strains. Consequently, the genes involved in the recognition and signaling of the PAMP-triggered immunity, such as receptor-like protein kinase genes and transcription factors are more likely to be activated in the blast nurseries than in the growth chamber, and these genes may play more important roles in blast resistance in the blast nurseries than in the growth chamber (single isolate condition).|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic RNA {{polymerase}} III transcribes tRNA genes, {{and this}} requires the transcription factor TFIIIC. Promoters are within genes, {{with which the}} B-block binding subunit of TFIIIC associates to initiate transcription. The binding subunits are more than 1000 amino acids in length in various eukaryotic species. There are four regions with conserved sequence similarities in the subunits. The helix-turn-helix motif is included {{in one of these}} regions and has been characterized as the B-block_TFIIIC family in the Pfam database. In the NCBI and EMBL translated protein databases, there are archaeal proteins (approximately 100 amino acids in length) referred to as B-block binding subunits. Most of them contain a B-block_TFIIIC motif. DELTA-BLAST searches using these archaeal proteins as queries showed significant <b>multiple</b> <b>blast</b> hits for many eukaryotic B-block binding subunits on the same proteins.

Most HERVs are ancient and invaded our genome at least 25 million years ago, {{except for the}} evolutionary young HERV-K group. The far majority of the encoded genes are degenerate due to mutational decay {{and only a few}} non-HERV-K loci are known to retain intact reading frames. Additional intact HERV genes may exist, since retroviral reading frames have not been systematically annotated on a genome-wide scale. Results By clustering of hits from <b>multiple</b> <b>BLAST</b> searches using known retroviral sequences we have mapped 1. 1 % of the human genome as retrovirus related. The coding potential of all identified HERV regions were analyzed by annotating viral open reading frames (vORFs) and we report 7836 loci as verified by protein homology criteria. Among 59 intact or almost-intact viral polyproteins scattered around the human genome we have found 29 envelope genes including two novel gammaretroviral types. One encodes a protein similar to a recently discovered zebrafish retrovirus (ZFERV) while another shows partial, C-terminal, homology to Syncytin (HERV-W/FRD). Conclusions This compilation of HERV sequences and their coding potential provide a useful tool for pursuing functional analysis such as RNA expression profiling and effects of viral proteins, which may, in turn, reveal a role for HERVs in human health and disease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach that}} improves the blasting efficiency in open pit mines. The aim {{of the study is}} the development of an environmentally friendly, low-emission production of dimension stone and gravel in six different quarries by optimizing the blasting technology. In addition to an improved energy-effective production of the muck pile two correlations of blast parameters were found. Both correlate the strain with the peak particle velocity: the first involves a “momentum-distance” relation and the second involves an “energy-distance ” relation. These relations suggest that the vibrations are controllable by adjusting the type of explosives, charge weights, borehole lengths, and borehole diameter. The simultaneous ignition of multiple charges according to the momentum theory does not increase the vibrations compared to consecutive ignition of smaller charges. This fact makes large blasting systems possible. The vibra-tion relations have to be determined individually for each quarry site. The zone of permanent deformation is defined on the basis of strain measurements at distances close to the blasting. Remarkably, damage in the form of crack formation does not occur in constructions outside of this zone, and this is independent of the construc-tion type. This is also valid for <b>multiple</b> <b>blast</b> impacts. parameters are calculated. If the forecast method is improved, the dimensioning of blasting systems is also improved...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The blast {{technique}} {{has been used}} as an effective soil improvement method to compact loose coarse-granular soils since 1930 s, {{and the use of the}} blast technique is extended as an application of in-situ liquefaction testing to investigate the performance of full scale foundations and countermeasures against liquefaction in recent decades. Several guidelines have been provided to determine optimum blast specification; however “Trial and Error” is mostly used in designing blast-induced liquefaction. Then, the mechanism of blast-induced liquefaction is still poorly understood. Accordingly, not consistent design procedures for blast-induced liquefaction has effectively been used in various types of soils. The objective of this work is to improve the relationship between explosive energy and ground vibration, ground surface settlement, and residual pore water pressure resulting from blast-induced liquefaction. In order to achieve this objective, the data from USA, Japan, Canada, and New Zealand, including blast densification and in-situ liquefaction testing in terms of explosive, are collected and screened for quality.
