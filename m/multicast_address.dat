2500|$|DR's {{exist for}} the purpose of {{reducing}} network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> 224.0.0.6. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> 224.0.0.5. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. [...] The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. [...] DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. [...] DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. [...] DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is {{also used}} by {{multiple}} hosts, which acquire the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> destination by participating in the multicast distribution protocol among the network routers.

50|$|Similar to a unicast address, the prefix of an IPv6 <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> {{specifies}} its scope, {{however, the}} set of possible scopes for a <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is different.

50|$|<b>Multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> {{are formed}} {{according}} to several specific formatting rules, depending on the application.|$|R
50|$|The 234.0.0.0/8 {{range is}} {{assigned}} by RFC 6034 as {{a range of}} global IPv4 <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> space provided to each organization that has /24 or larger globally routed unicast address space allocated; one <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is reserved per /24 of unicast space. A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the mechanisms in IPv4 and IPv6 become more similar.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of using this <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> {{arises from the}} use of flow control between network switches. The particular <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> used is selected from a range of address which have been reserved by the IEEE 802.1D standard which specifies the operation of switches used for bridging. Normally, a frame with a multicast destination sent to a switch will be forwarded out to all other ports of the switch. However, this range of <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is special and will not be forwarded by an 802.1D-compliant switch. Instead, frames sent to this range are understood to be frames meant to be acted upon only within the switch.|$|E
50|$|SSDP is a text-based {{protocol}} {{based on}} HTTPU. It uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the underlying transport protocol.

The protocol creates a segmented logical network based on <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing</b> associated with hospital beds. The objective of MP-HA is to ensure the determinism on network through medium access control mechanism increasing the transmission throughput. Thus, it creates a periodical environment making use of the parallel cycles which is called multicycles...|$|R
50|$|IPv6 {{addresses}} {{are classified}} by the primary addressing and routing methodologies common in networking: unicast addressing, anycast <b>addressing,</b> and <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{applications}} {{may use the}} source-specific <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> {{derived from}} the local IPv6 routing prefix, with group ID C (decimal 12).|$|R
50|$|However, {{to prevent}} any {{intervening}} Ethernet switches from flooding the multicast frames out of all switch ports, which turns the traffic profile into something more like broadcast, intermediate switches should implement MLD snooping, which {{would allow them to}} send traffic that is addressed to a solicited-node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> (or any other <b>multicast</b> <b>address)</b> to be sent out only on the ports that lead to stations that have subscribed to receive that traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} this process is the IPv6 link-local {{solicited}} node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> that the Neighbor Solicitation packet is sent to.|$|E
50|$|Because a solicited-node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is a {{function}} of the last 24-bits of an IPv6 unicast (or anycast) address, the number of hosts that are subscribed to each solicited-node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is very small. This number would typically be one, but there could be a few because the mapping function is not a 1:1 mapping. This means that a host should not need to be interrupted as often to service neighbor solicitation requests, compared to ARP in IPv4.|$|E
5000|$|Routing Information Protocol (RIP) {{runs over}} the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Version 1 {{operates}} in broadcast mode, while version 2 uses <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), {{the next}} {{generation}} Internet Protocol, does not implement the method of broadcast, and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. Instead, IPv6 uses <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing</b> to the all-hosts multicast group. No IPv6 protocols are defined to use the all-hosts address, though; instead, they send and receive on particular link-local <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses.</b> This results in higher efficiency, because network hosts which are not listening for the particular multicast protocol(s) in use are not disturbed or interrupted, as they would be by broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|If {{the least}} {{significant}} bit of the first octet is set to 1, the frame will still be sent only once; however, NICs will choose to accept it based on criteria other than the matching of a MAC address: for example, based on a configurable list of accepted <b>multicast</b> MAC <b>addresses.</b> This is called <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
