Biosolid rates from 2 to 10 t/ha were applied in 1993. Shoot dry matter production {{at different stages of}} plant development (9 and 15 weeks after sowing) and grain production of Triticum durum and Hordeum vulgare, as well as nutrient concentration in shoots and grain, were taken as indicators for comparing nutrient availability of the 2 sources. A 2 -t biosolid application was found to enhance dry-matter production and yield to the same extent as a <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application</b> of 20 kg N/ha, 20 kg P/ha, and 1. 8 – 2. 8 kg Zn/ha. In some crop rotations and on sites with a high yield potential, additional nitrogen with 2 t biosolids/ha would be necessary to achieve such yields. However, development of durum wheat fertilised with 2 t biosolids was slower and P uptake lower than with mineral fertiliser until late booting. Durum wheat fertilised with 4 t biosolids showed similar P-uptake values as plants fertilised with the mineral fertiliser. The Zn-uptake of plants was positively correlated with biosolid application rates, showing a linear relationship. A 2 -t biosolid application alleviated micronutrient deficiency to the same extent as the same rate of Zn (and Cu) given in mineral form. Karin Weggler-Beaton, Robin D. Graham and Michael J.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve {{understanding}} of the role of organic inputs and soil organic matter (SOM) for crop production in contemporary arable farming in Europe. For this purpose, long-term experiments were analysed on the additional yield effect of organic inputs and savings in mineral fertiliser. In addition, a farm survey was conducted to find drivers and barriers for the use of organic inputs and to assess if arable farmers in Europe perceive a deficiency of SOM. The findings in this thesis suggest that at least on the shorter term, on average, {{there seems to be no}} immediate threat from a deficiency of SOM to crop production in arable farming in Europe. The long-term experiments showed that with sufficient use of only mineral fertilisers, on average, similar yields could be attained over multiple years as with the combined use of organic inputs and mineral fertiliser. This was reflected in the farm survey, in which a large majority of farmers indicated not to perceive a deficiency of SOM. Analysis of long-term experiments also showed that more mineral fertiliser N was saved when using farmyard manure at high N rates (with <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application)</b> than at low N rates (without <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application),</b> based on comparisons at equal yield. Specific crops and environments did benefit from organic inputs and more SOM in terms of crop production. Long-term experiments showed that organic inputs give benefit to crop production in wet climates and on sandy soils. In addition, farmers perceived a higher deficiency of SOM on steep slopes, sandy soils, wet and very dry climates. The additional yield effect of organic inputs was significant for potatoes. More in general, farmers who cultivated larger shares of their land with specialized crops (including potatoes, sugar beets, onions and other vegetables) than cereals perceived a higher deficiency of SOM. It seems that while the functions of SOM can be replaced with technical means to a large extent (e. g. tillage, use of mineral fertilisers), there are limits to this technical potential when environmental conditions are more extreme and crops are more demanding. The farm survey revealed that farmers perceive a trade-off between improved soil quality on the one hand and increased pressures from weeds, pests and diseases and financial consequences on the other hand when using organic inputs. If policies aim to stimulate the maintenance or increase of SOM, more insight is needed into the conditions that regulate the pressures of weeds, pests and diseases in response to organic inputs. Financial consequences (at least on the short term) should also be accounted for. More importantly however, benefits from SOM for crop production cannot be taken for granted. Only in specific situations such benefits will exist. If European policies on SOM aim to include benefits for crop production, focus should be on areas with more extreme environmental conditions (very dry or wet climates, steep slopes, sandy soils), or cropping systems with more specialized or horticultural crops rather than cereals...|$|E

Moench], cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and groundnut (Arachnis hypogeae L.) {{was conducted on}} severely P-deficient acid sandy soils of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso to measure changes in pH and nutrient availability as affected by distance from the root surface and by <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application.</b> Treatments included three rates of phosphorus (P) and four levels of nitrogen (N) application. Bulk, rhizosphere and rhizoplane soils were sampled at 35, 45 and 75 DAS in 1997 and at 55 and 65 DAS in 1998. Regardless of the cropping system and level of mineral fertiliser applied, soil pH consistently increased between 0. 7 and two units from the bulk soil to the rhizoplane of millet. Similar pH gradients were observed in cowpea, but pH changes were much smaller in sorghum with a difference of only 0. 3 units. Shifts in pH led to large increases in nutrient availability close to the roots. Compared with the bulk soil, available P in the rhizoplane was between 190 and 270 % higher for P-Bray and between 360 and 600 % higher for P-water. Exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) levels were also higher in the millet rhizoplane than in the bulk soil, whereas exchangeable aluminium (Al) levels decreased with increasing pH close to the root surface. The results suggest an important role of root-induced pH increases for crops to cope with acidity-induced nutrient deficiency and Al stress of soils in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa...|$|E

30|$|Studies of {{regional}} differences in Douglas-fir wood density have identified elevation, temperature, rainfall, soil, and silvicultural factors as drivers of wood density in New Zealand and elsewhere (Erickson and Lambert 1958; Jozsa and Brix 1989; Brix 1993; Beets et al. 2001; Kantavichai et al. 2010; Kimberley et al. 2017). Two important environmental drivers influencing wood density variation in New Zealand-grown Douglas-fir and radiata pine are mean annual temperature and nitrogen fertility of the site, while stocking/thinning {{has a small}} effect on density (Kimberley et al. 2017). The importance of nitrogen supply on wood density was clearly demonstrated for radiata pine growing on nitrogen-deficient coastal dunes, where nitrogen inputs from <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>applications</b> and legumes decreased wood density and latewood percent (Beets et al. 2001). The influence of temperature on density was more evident in overseas studies than in New Zealand, where historic surveys of breast height outerwood density did not find a relationship with temperature. This unexpected result was previously ascribed to confounding owing to seedlot differences in density, as discussed by Kimberley et al. (2017). The most recent compilation and analysis has clearly shown that temperature is the main climatic factor determining outerwood density variation in New Zealand, and that the fertility of the site is also relevant (Kimberley et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Using 40 -year {{experiment}} {{data from}} a mono-modal rainfall area of northern Togo, we analyzed soil fertility dynamics when 2 and 3 -year fallows were alternated with 3 -year rotation of groundnut, cotton and sorghum. The control treatment consisted to continuous cultivate the soil in a rotation of groundnut/cotton/sorghum without fallow periods. For each rotation, two fertilisation rates were applied: no fertilisation and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application</b> during the cropping and/or the fallow periods. Yields of unfertilised crops, which averaged 1 t ha- 1 during {{the first years of}} cultivation, were often nil in the long-term. In the long-term, yields of fertilised cotton and sorghum decreased by 32 and 50 %, respectively compared to the average of 2. 4 and 1. 6 t ha- 1 obtained during the first decade of cultivation. The long-term decline in crop productivity was mitigated when fallow periods were alternated with cropping periods, and consequently there was partial compensation in terms of production for the unproductive fallowed plots. Long-term yields of fertilised cotton and sorghum in the periodically fallowed plots were 40 and 50 % higher than those in continuously cropped plots, respectively; they were 90 and 60 % higher than those in continuously cropped plots without fertilisation. Like for crop productivity, soil C, N and exchangeable Ca and Mg decreased less in periodically fallowed plots than in continuously cropped plots. The limited soil C decline when fallows were alternated with crops appears to be the consequence of no-tillage period rather than the effect of the highest C inputs to the soil...|$|E

A multifactor, 40 year field experiment was conducted in Kompolt, Hungary on a carbonate-free, slightly acidic chernozem brown forest soil (USDA: Ustolls) {{with the objective of}} determining the effect of different management systems with concurrent removal of the above ground biomass on the SOM content of the 0 - 320 mm layer. A multifactor experiment composed of treatments involving different crop rotation (CR), beef manure application, <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application,</b> above ground BR (vs. biomass incorporation, BI) and lucerne management options for different rotations are the basis of this study. CR had no significant effect on SOM content. Management options that included a four year lucerne stand produced significantly higher SOM content in five out of six fertiliser and biomass management combinations. Continuous manure applications and manure + NPK fertiliser resulted in a significantly greater SOM content than management options that minimised or eliminated fertiliser or manure additions. SOM content for different soil amendments and biomass treatments ranked: BR < NPK + BR < BI < manure + BR = NPK + manure + BR with SOM contents of 2. 75 < 2. 82 < 2. 87 < 2. 92 per cent (w/w) respectively. Manure had the most profound effect because its significance was most consistent across a range of management combinations and years.

40|$|Article in pressIt {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} argued that <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application</b> combined with in situ retention of crop residue biomass can sustain long-term productivity of West African soils. Using 20 -year experimental data from southern Togo, a biannual rainfall area, we analysed {{the effect of}} two rates of mineral NPK fertiliser application to maize–cotton rotation on the long-term dynamics of soil C and nutrient contents, as compared with two control treatments. Mineral fertiliser treatments consisted of application to both maize (first season) and cotton (second season) the research-recommended NPK rates (Fertiliser-RR) and 1. 5 times these rates (Fertiliser- 1. 5 RR). Control treatments consisted of cropping maize and cotton without fertiliser use (No-Fertiliser) and of double annual soil tillage (as done for planted treatments) without planting a crop (Tillage-NoCrop). Maize residue biomass was every year returned to the soil of crops planted treatments, whereas cotton stems were uprooted, piled and burnt on the experimental plots as done locally for phyto-sanitary reasons. Treatment effects were analysed through a long-term change in crop productivity, in soil C and nutrient contents. Our results indicate that productivity of maize and notably of cotton cannot be sustained in this Ferralsol without nutrient inputs. On average, maize yields without fertilisers decreased from 2 t ha? 1 after woodland clearing to 0. 5 t ha? 1 after 10 years of cultivation, while cotton yields decreased from 1. 5 to 0. 5 t ha? 1 only after 5 years. In spite of the need of mineral fertiliser use to sustain productivity of this soil, there was little justification to increase inputs of mineral fertiliser over the research recommended rate. Over 20 -year experiment, both maize and cotton while received N, P and K inputs at the research-recommended rates produced virtually the same yields as when these rates were increased by 50 %. Although C inputs to soil under RR and 1. 5 RR were greater than in the No-Fertiliser control (nil for Tillage-NoCrop), and the N input was more favourable for 1. 5 RR, the rates in which contents of soil C and N decreased over time did not differ substantially between treatments. Soil available P decreased for all treatments, while exchangeable K concentration increased under RR and 1. 5 RR and decreased in unfertilised treatments (No-Fertiliser and Tillage-NoCrop). In fertilised plots and in tillage no-planted plots, soil pH decreased more than in No-Fertiliser plots. A decline of soil pH {{was associated with a}} decline of exchangeable Ca and Mg, which were on average 20 and 40 % higher in fertilised plots than in No-Fertiliser plots.

We examined the influence of manure and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>applications</b> on temporal trends in the stable N (15 N) and C (13 C) isotopes of wheat collected during 1968 - 1979 and 1996 - 2005, and of soil collected in 1966 and 2000. The soil 15 N values in 1966 and 2000 were higher in manure than the mineral N supplied soil; the latter had similar or higher 15 N values than non-fertilised soil. The straw 15 N values significantly decreased in all N treatments during 1968 to 1979, but not for 1996 - 2005. The straw 15 N values decreased under the highest mineral N supply (192 kg N ha- 1 year- 1) by 3 from 1968 to 1979. Mineral N supply significantly increased to straw 13 C values in dry years, but not in wet years. Significant correlations existed between wheat straw 13 C values with cumulative rainfall (March to June). The cultivar Hereward (grown 1996 - 2005) was less affected by changes in environmental conditions (i. e. water stress and fertiliser regime) than Cappelle Desprez (1968 - 1979). We conclude that, in addition to <b>fertiliser</b> type and <b>application</b> rates, water stress and, importantly, plant variety influenced plant 13 C and 15 N values.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the long-term (up to nine years) impacts of nutrient management strategies and their local feasibility on crop productivity, soil fertility status and rainfall infiltration on two contrasting soil types and different prior management regimes in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. The nutrient management strategies employed in the study were: a control with no fertiliser, amendments of 100 kg N ha− 1, 100 kg N + lime, three rates of manure application (5, 15 and 25 t ha− 1) in combination with 100 kg N ha− 1, and three rates of P fertiliser (10, 30 and 50 kg P ha− 1) in combination with 100 kg N, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha− 1. Maize grain yields in sandy soils did not respond to the sole application of 100 kg N ha− 1; manure application had immediate and incremental benefits on crop yields on the sandy soils. A combination of 25 t ha− 1 manure and 100 kg N gave the largest treatment yield of 9. 3 t ha− 1 on the homefield clay soils, 6. 1 t ha− 1 in the clay outfield, 7. 6 t ha− 1 in the homefield and 3. 4 t ha− 1 in the eighth season. Yields of the largest manure application on the sandy outfields were comparable to yields with 100 kg N in combination with 30 kg P, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha− 1 in the homefields suggesting the need to target nutrients differently to different fields. Manure application improved rainfall infiltration in the clay soils from 21 to 31 mm h− 1 but on the sandy soils the manure effect on infiltration was not significant. Despite the large manure applications, crop productivity and SOC build-up in the outfield sandy soils was small highlighting the difficulty to recover the fertility of degraded soils. The major cause of poor crop productivity on the degraded sandy soils despite the large additions of manure could not be ascertained. The current practice of allocating manure and fertiliser to fields closest to homesteads exacerbates land degradation in the sandy outfields and increases soil fertility gradients but results in the most harvest for the farm. On clay soils, manure may be targeted to outfields and mineral fertiliser to homefields to increase total crop productivity. Farmers who owned cattle in the study site can achieve high manure application rates on small plots, and manure application can be rotated according to crop sequences. Consistent application of manure in combination with mineral fertilisers can be an effective option to improve crop yield, SOC and moisture conservation under smallholder farming conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{selected}} processes of N fluxes in Swedish and Nigerian agricultural systems and relate them {{to the use of}} mineral and organic amendments and other agricultural management practices. Long-term effects of crop rotation, crop residue treatment and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application</b> levels on topsoil carbon (C), plant N uptake, net N mineralisation and soil organic matter fractions in temperate soils were investigated using soils from Swedish long-term agricultural field experiments (16 - 40 years). Topsoil carbon (C) was measured and plant N uptake was estimated in a pot experiment using soils (0 - 30 cm) from six locations in Sweden: Fjärdingslöv, Lönnstorp, Lanna, Bjertorp, Högåsa and Röbäcksdalen. Topsoil C content was significantly affected by crop rotation (ley > cereals), although crop residue return had no significant effect. Plant N uptake was up to 50 % higher in soils from crop rotations with long-term leys than cereals. Net N mineralisation and microbial respiration was measured in an incubation study using soils from four locations: Lönnstorp, Lanna, Bjertorp, Röbäcksdalen. Net N mineralisation was greater in soils from ley crop rotations. Crop residue return had no effect on net N mineralisation. Soils from two locations (Lönnstorp and Lanna) were size-density fractionated. Preliminary results indicate that an unexpectedly high fraction of soil C and N in the low-input soils was found in fine fractions not associated with minerals. Abundance and mobilisation of non-exchangeable ammonium (NEA) in soils (0 - 30 cm) from five locations of the long-term experiments in Sweden was estimated. NEA contents in these Swedish soils ranged from 20 - 200 ppm and increased with clay content. NEA content decreased over 168 days by up to 60 % during a pot experiment where ryegrass was grown, suggesting that NEA partly can become plant-available during the cropping season. The potential for in situ produced legume organic matter (OM) was tested in a dry season legume fallow rotation in a field experiment in Ibadan, Nigeria. Five legumes (Pueraria phaseoloides, Vigna unguiculata, Glycine max, Mucuna pruriens and Cajanus cajan) were evaluated in terms of dry season biomass production, effect on following maize crop and fertiliser yield increase. Biomass production ranged from 1000 - 8300 kg ha- 1, which was generally greater than that of the natural fallow. Maize yields, which ranged between 1000 - 2600 kg ha- 1, increased with 10 - 35 % after addition of the in situ produced legume OM. Depending on legume placement (early incorporation, surface application and late incorporation) maize grain yield increased with up to 25 kg for every kg of fertiliser added. N 2 O fluxes were measured in situ in a legume-maize crop rotation in a field trial in Ibadan, Nigeria, where OM was incorporated prior to maize planting. Fluxes were measured during two rainy seasons and one dry season. Fluxes up to 138 µg m- 2 h- 1 were observed. Annual N 2 O-related N losses were estimated to be up to 8 kg N ha- 1. The results presented here indicate that farmer management decisions, be it in Sweden or Nigeria, can significantly affect N fluxes, which will in turn affect long-term agricultural and environmental sustainability...|$|E

The experiment was set up according to an incomplete, optimal design, with 3 factors at five levels and 12 treatments including a control with two replications. Grain yields were greatly influenced by the amount of rain during the growing season, and by soil water at sowing. Annual mean grain yields ranged from 3 to 10 t ha- 1 and treatment mean yields from 4. 2 to 7. 2 t ha- 1. The WUE ranged from 40 in treatments with balanced nutrient inputs in dry (weather/or soil) years to 6. 5 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 for the control treatments in wet years.

Balanced combination of stover (3000 – 6000 kg), manure (1500 – 6000 kg) and N fertiliser (105 kg) gave the highest yield and hence WUE. It is suggested that 100 kg N per ha should be a best choice, to be adapted according to availability of stover and manure. Possible management options under variable rainfall conditions to alleviate occurring moisture stress for crops must be tailored to the rainfall pattern.

It was further developed to compare nutrient fluxes (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, humus) and pollutants (heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) of pig and cattle slurry as well as human urine. The data used is taken from literature and, {{in the case of}} pharmaceuticals in urine, daily excretion rates were calculated. An amount of 19 m 3 ha- 1 a- 1 undiluted urine can be applied, limiting factor is sulphur. Without taking over-fertilisation into account, an addition of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is required to any organic <b>fertiliser</b> <b>application.</b> In general, heavy metal, antibiotic, and hormone fluxes are higher by using animal manure then urine as fertiliser. However, additional loads of other pharmaceuticals consumed by humans have to be considered. Overall, the model is a suitable tool worthwhile to be extended in aspects of hygiene, environmental impacts as for example, degradation processes as well as ecotoxicology...|$|R

Recovery of 15 N in wheat was 37 %, 10 % and 47 % from urine, faeces and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> respectively, and decreased strongly in the residual years. In total 41 %, 15 % and 50 % of 15 N applied as urine, faeces and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was recovered by the three crops. 15 N recovered from originally applied urine, faeces and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in the topsoil (0 – 18 cm) {{at the end of the}} third vegetation period was 19 %, 25 % and 20 %, respectively. Of urine-, faeces- and mineral fertiliser- 15 N, 40 %, 61 % and 29 %, respectively, was not recovered by the three crops and in topsoil suggesting significant transport of 15 N-labelled components to deeper soil layers. CONMIN and BIOORG differed neither in fertiliser N use efficiency by crops nor in 15 N recovery in soil indicating insignificant difference in the turnover and utilization of the applied manure nitrogen in the conventional and the bio-organic cropping systems...|$|R

40|$|How land-application of {{digestate}} sourced from {{anaerobic digestion}} (AD) of animal waste influences {{the functioning of}} a mixed pasture agroecosystem is not well characterised, {{particularly with regard to}} the response of the actively growing microbial community. We studied the impact of the liquid AD digestate on the decomposer community in two different soils, seeded with two different common grassland crops; a mixture of either grass or grass/clover in a greenhouse experiment. We studied bacterial (leucine incorporation into bacteria) and fungal (acetate incorporation into ergosterol) growth responses to AD cattle slurry digestate, undigested cattle slurry, <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (NPK and N) added at a rate equivalent to 150 kg N ha(- 1), and a no-fertiliser control treatment. Differences in fungal and bacterial growth were evident between the soil and sward types. However, the fertilisers consistently stimulated a higher bacterial growth than the no-fertiliser control, and liquid digestate resulted in a level of bacterial growth higher or equal to that of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> whilst undigested slurry resulted in lower bacterial growth. These fertiliser effects on bacterial growth mirrored the effects on plant growth. In contrast, the fungal community responded only marginally to fertiliser treatments. We conclude that the application of digestate stimulates the bacterial decomposer community in a similar way to that of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Our results suggest that <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> can be exchanged for liquid digestate with limited impact on the actively growing soil microbial community that, in turn, regulate important soil processes including nutrient cycling in agricultural soils...|$|R

Kohlrabi was grown in two pot experiments in consecutive years using digestate, <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (urea) with a nitrogen (N) content equivalent to that in the digestate, <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> with N, phosphate (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) contents equivalent to the digestate, and an unfertilised control. At harvest, the soil receiving the digestate application had higher P, K and Mg contents than the control and the urea treatment. The soil Nmin content was balanced in all fertilised treatments. Soil pH was unaffected by all treatments. Kohlrabi bulbs from the unfertilised control had the lowest weight, nitrate content and ascorbic acid content. Digestate and NPKMg fertiliser treatments increased bulb weight compared with the N-only urea treatment. Ascorbic acid content did not differ between fertilised treatments. There were no differences in bulb nitrate content between the <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments, but digestate application gave a low nitrate content.

The field study was performed between May- 1997 and May- 2000 in a commercial dairy-cattle farm located in Northwest Portugal. Five treatments were employed: Control with no N fertiliser (T 0); one application of cattle-slurry at maize sowing with 187 (T 1) or 340 (T 2) kg total N ha- 1 year- 1; two applications, 258 kg total N ha- 1 at maize and 150 kg total N ha- 1 at ryegrass sowing plus application of 190 kg total N ha- 1 to maize and 50 kg total N ha- 1 to ryegrass as <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> totalizing 648 kg total N ha- 1 year- 1 (T 3), and; application of 240 kg total N ha- 1 year- 1 as <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to both crops like in T 3 (T 4). Net N mineralisation was measured in soil layer 0 - 30 cm in each treatment. Significant amounts of N were released (160 - 290 kg N ha- 1 year- 1) by mineralisation due cattle-slurry application to soil, with apparent net N mineralisation varying between 45 and 95 % of the total N applied. The <b>application</b> of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> led to N immobilisation (- 23 %) of the total N applied.

40|$|Applying {{nitrogen}} fertilisers in legume {{species has}} been subjected to scientific research due to the efficacy of these fertilisers on yield (symbiotic atmospheric nitrogen fixation). In general, applying high rates of nitrogen fertilisers on legume species does not correlate directly with green matter production because these species take the necessary nitrogen from the atmosphere.

40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried out during 1999 - 2003 in {{southern}} Sweden in order to evaluate the effect of anaerobically digested, source separated food waste originating from households as fertiliser in cereal pro-duction. The aim of the trials was to study {{the effect of the}} fertiliser on yield and grain quality in produc-tion of spring-sown cereals and to establish nutrient field balances. The field trials were designed as split plot trials with three replications with seven treatments in 1999, 2000 and 2003, and eight treatments in 2001 and 2002. The digested residues (DR), with a dry matter con-tent of 1 - 3 %, were compared to <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (all years) and slurry from dairy cattle (2001 - 2003). Two different spreading strategies were evaluated in 1999 and 2000; spreading at time of sowing as well as spreading when the crop was between 15 and 20 cm high. In 2002 and 2003 a treatment with concentrat-ed DR was included. Results show that DR is a fertiliser that can replace <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in cereal production.
