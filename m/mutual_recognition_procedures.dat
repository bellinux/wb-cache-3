40|$|The {{regulatory}} system for medicinal products includes {{the existence of}} a legislative framework and a medicines agency as the regulatory body. The legislative framework for medicinal products has been amended several times so as to align it with the EU acquis communautaire, where medicinal products represent one of the best regulated and aligned areas. For the purpose of regulating the Croatian medicines market, the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices was established in 2003 to implement the procedure of granting marketing authorisation for medicinal products, to supervise the adverse reactions of medicinal products, to conduct laboratory tests of the quality of medicines and vaccines sampled from the market, to issue licences for the manufacture and distribution of medicinal products, to monitor medicine consumption, and to inform about medicines and promote their rational use. Medical devices are regulated under a special act, and the Agency conducts entries into the register in that field and carries out vigilance over medical devices. In this way, products intended for health care on the Croatian market are of the appropriate quality, safety and efficacy, and are under the constant supervision of the competent body that assesses their risk-to-benefit ratio. Upon accession of the Republic of Croatia to full membership in the European Union, the Agency will be included in the European authorisation procedures for medicines, such as the centralised procedure in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and above all, the <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>procedure</b> and decentralised procedure in which the role of the agencies of EU Member States is greater.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the outcomes of marketing authorisation applications via the <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> and decentralised <b>procedures</b> (MRP/DCP) and assess determinants of licensing failure during CMDh referral procedures. METHODS: All MRP/DCP procedures to the Co-ordination group for <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> and Decentralised procedures-human (CMDh) during the period from January 2006 to December 2013 were analysed. Reasons for starting referral procedures were scored. In addition, a survey under pharmaceutical companies was performed to estimate the frequency of licensing failure prior to CMDh referrals. RESULTS: During the study period, 10392 MRP/DCP procedures were finalized. Three hundred seventy-seven (3. 6 %) resulted in a referral procedure, of which 70 (19 %) resulted in licensing failure, defined as refusal or withdrawal of the application. The frequency of CMDh referrals decreased from 14. 5 % in 2006 to 1. 6 % in 2013. Of all referrals, 272 (72 %) were resolved through consensus within the CMDh, the remaining 105 (28 %) were resolved at the level of the CHMP. Most referrals were started because of objections raised about the clinical development program. Study design issues and objections about the demonstration of equivalence were most likely to result in licensing failure. An estimated 11 % of all MRP/DCP procedures resulted in licensing failure prior to CMDh referral. CONCLUSION: Whereas the absolute number of MRP/DCP procedures resulting in a referral has reduced substantially over the past years, no specific time trend could be observed regarding the frequency of referrals resulting in licensing failure. Increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via the MRP/DCP...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{may benefit}} from new uses for old drugs. Competent {{authorities}} such as the European Medicines Agency evaluate the quality, efficacy and safety of a medicinal product for the use in a well-defined therapeutic indication. Innovations may continue upon the approval, for example through the licensing of new therapeutic indications or dosage forms, which {{is also known as}} post-innovation innovation. The development of new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, could allow for a quicker and cheaper drug development by the utilisation of existing knowledge. The aim of the present thesis was to provide insight in the performance of the drug regulatory system for medicines in the post-innovation phase of their life cycle. Special interest {{has been paid to the}} period after the approval of the first generic product version of a drug: the post-generic phase. That occasion may significantly affect the intellectual property prospects of a drug and may limit the opportunities to make a return on investments for further innovations. First, we showed through two studies that in the European Union’s Decentralised <b>Procedure</b> and the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> <b>procedure,</b> which are frequently used to obtain approval for generic medicinal products, licensing failure occurred in about 1 out of 10 licensing procedures. The reasons for licensing failure varied widely and were both of a drug quality and clinical nature. It was also concluded that increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via both procedures. Subsequently, we studied to what extent the drug regulatory system allowed for innovation during the post-innovation phase of the drug life cycle. We showed that extensions of the indication of already licensed medicinal products were mainly authorised a few years before approval of the first generic product version and ceased thereafter. On the contrary we found that old drugs were licensed as new medicinal products approved for new therapeutic indications or other innovations. A case study indicated that the viability of the business case for the development of such medicines may depend on a specific window of opportunity within a therapeutic area and the possibility to establish a period of relative exclusivity. We also demonstrated that after approval of a first generic product version the number of clinical trials with those drugs decreased but a considerable amount of clinical research still remained. Our analysis of the EU legislation and case-law of the European Court of Justice showed that the need for prior market approval has consistently been considered to be the general rule of the EU legislation on medicinal products; also for post-innovation innovation. However, we observed a clinical need for unlicensed pharmacy preparations and off-label use, while there are even more potential new uses. These observations in combination with society’s struggle with the need to license new uses of existing drugs and the lack of adequate incentives to do so, suggests that the drug regulatory system is under pressure. Regulatory reform is needed to enhance post-innovation innovation and use every drug to its full potential...|$|R

Comparing <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> to its alternative – harmonization and national treatment – it gives an introductory overview of the characteristics of the principle. <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> it is shown, faces significant preconditions as rules to be mutually recognized have to be equivalent; moreover, rules {{with a high degree of}} input legitimacy are difficult to transfer.

40|$|Because <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is now {{enshrined}} in the Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties and judicial cooperation instruments (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between police, customs and judicial cooperation and move ahead with the introduction of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{appreciated}} innovations of the EU. The idea is that one can pursue market integration, indeed "deep' market integration, while respecting 'diversity' amongst the participating countries. Put differently, in pursuing 'free movement' for goods, <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> facilitates free movement by disciplining the nature and scope of 'regulatory barriers', whilst allowing some degree of regulatory discretion for EU Member States. This BEER paper attempts to explain the rationale and logic of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> in the EU internal goods market, its working in actual practice for about three decades now, culminating in a qualitative cost/benefit analysis and its recent improvement in terms of 'governance' in the so-called New Legislative Framework (first denoted as the 2008 Goods package) thereby ameliorating the benefits/costs ratio. For new (in contrast to existing) national regulation, the intrusive EU <b>procedure</b> to impose <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is presented as well, with basic data so as to show its critical importance to keep the internal goods market free. All this is complemented by a short summary of the scant economic literature on <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition.</b> Subsequently, the analysis is extended to the internal market for services. This is done in two steps, first by reminding the debate on the origin principle (which goes further than <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> EU-style) and how <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> works under the horizontal services directive.

In an assessment of the two main <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> schemes - the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> Agreement (MRA) and the Trans-Tasman <b>Mutual</b> <b>Recognition</b> Arrangement (TTMRA) - the Commission found that they brought benefits through increased mobility of labour and greater movement of merchandise between jurisdictions.

40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> is therefore {{nothing less than}} a specific application of that other fundamental aspect of building the Community: the {{principle of}} subsidiarity enshrined in Article 3 b of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty on European Union [Commission, 1994, p. 35] The principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> has been derived from Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, and is claimed to be a practical example of subsidiarity. <b>Mutual</b> <b>recognition,</b> however, whilst striking down trade barriers does not create a Single Market for it results in product characteristics being determined by location of production.
