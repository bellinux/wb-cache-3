2500|$|Schweitzer {{developed}} a technique for recording {{the performances of}} Bach's music. Known as [...] "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what {{is commonly known as}} <b>mid-side.</b> The <b>mid-side</b> sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular <b>mid-side.</b> The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.|$|E

5000|$|At the apexes of the {{triangle}} corresponding to the points [...] and [...] of Jupiter's orbit, the Hildas approach the Trojans. At the <b>mid-sides</b> of {{the triangle}}, they {{are close to the}} asteroids of the external part of the asteroid belt. The velocity dispersion of Hildas is more evident than that of Trojans in the regions where they intersect. It {{should also be noted that}} the dispersion of Trojans in inclination is twice that of the Hildas. Due to this, as much as one quarter of the Trojans cannot intersect with the Hildas, and at all times many Trojans are located outside Jupiter's orbit. Therefore, the regions of intersection are limited. This is illustrated by the adjacent figure that shows the Hildas (black) and the Trojans (gray) along the ecliptic plane. One can see the spherical form of the Trojan swarms.|$|R
40|$|FEMsimulation {{of large}} {{deformations}} as occur in metal forming processes is usually accompanied with highly distorted meshes. This leads first {{to a reduction}} of accuracy and later to loss of convergence when implicit solvers are used. Remeshing {{can be used to}} reduce element distortion, but repeated remeshing will result in smoothing of data like equivalent plastic strain, due to averaging and interpolation. A meshless method circumvents the problem of mesh distortion, but depending on the integration of the weak formulation of equilibrium mapping of data and hence smoothing of data still remains unless a nodal integration scheme is used. Starting with a LocalMaximum Entropy approach [1] with nodal integration, we end-up with a smoothed Finite Element formulation in the limit of local approximations [2]. It is straightforward to adapt the triangulation in every increment, yielding an Adaptive Smoothed Finite Element Method, in which large deformations can be modelled with a Lagrangian description without the necessity to map data from one step to the other. A cell based stabilized conforming nodal integration method (SCNI) [3] is used. Depending on the configuration of nodes, nodal integration can yield singular stiffness matrices, resulting in spurious displacement modes [4]. A stabilization is used, based on minimizing the difference between a ‘linear assumed’ and the consistent strain field. The cells are based on the Delaunay triangulation, connecting <b>mid-sides</b> and centres of gravity of the triangles (Figure 1).

5000|$|A {{different}} Eldorado Brougham {{was sold}} for 1959 and 1960. These cars were {{not quite so}} extravagantly styled but were very unusual pieces in themselves. Priced at $13,075, they cost $1 more, each, than their older siblings. The company contracted out the assembly to Pininfarina of Italy, with whom the division has had a long-running relationship, and these Eldorados were essentially hand-built in Italy. Ironically only now did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs and doorsill moldings, presumably because the design work and final touches were still being done by Fleetwood. Discreet, narrow taillights integrated into modest tailfins, and a squared-off rear roof line with rear ventiplanes caused the Italian-built Brougham to contrast sharply to the rounded roof lines, and especially the new [...] "rocketship" [...] taillights and flamboyant fins of the standard 1959 Cadillacs, which are a feature only of that year. A vertical crest medallion with Brougham script plate appeared on the front fenders and a single, thin molding ran from the front to rear along the <b>mid-sides</b> of the body. It did not sport Eldorado front fender letters or body sill headlights. A fin-like crest, or [...] "skeg," [...] ran from behind the front wheel opening {{to the rear of}} the car on the lower bodysides and there were special crest medallions on the trailing edge of the rear fenders. The Brougham's styling cues would prove to indicate where standard Cadillac styling would head from 1960 through the early-mid-1960s. The standard equipment list was pared down to match those of other Eldorados, plus Cruise Control, Autronic Eye, air conditioning and E-Z Eye glass. The Brougham build-quality was not nearly to the standard of the Detroit hand-built 1957-1958 models, and thus the 1959-1960 Broughams did not sell as well as their forebears. However, collector interest and values for these cars remain high. The Eldorado Brougham was moved to its own unique Series 6900 for its remaining two years.|$|R

Both these systems have been studied extensively and used correctly should give reasonably reliable results. Pre wool classing micron test results are a useful guide for classers in determining lines of wool to be made. Samples of fleece can also be shorn from the animal and sent to a laboratory for measurement ("midside sampling"). Most fleece-testing laboratories nowadays use related instruments to those mentioned—either the OFDA models or the Laserscan.

Twelve locations, one flock per flock were studied. Three sites have been sampled from each animal (Shoulder, <b>mid-side</b> and breech).

40|$|The {{portable}} fibre-testing instrument OFDA 2000 has {{applications in}} the mohair industry for both fibre classing and animal selection. A comparison was completed between single-staple <b>mid-side</b> testing using an OFDA 2000 and conventional laboratory <b>mid-side</b> testing using an OFDA 100. <b>Mid-side</b> mohair samples (n= 504) were collected from two consecutive shearings of a mixed sex group of Angora kids at 6 and 12 months of age. The samples were at the fine end (average 20. 9 µm) of the mean fibre diameter range of mohair. There was a bias between the estimates of mean fibre diameter at both shearings. The other traits studied also had biases between measurement methods. The regression analyses results of mean fibre diameter from the two test methods accounted for 91 % and 88 % of the variance for first and second shearings, respectively. Regression analyses between test methods for standard deviation, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature accounted for less variance than the regressions of mean fibre diameter results. The results indicate OFDA 2000 is suitable for estimation of mean fibre diameter of greasy kid mohair staples and is therefore useful for both mohair classing and Angora selection. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

[...] The hierarchical degenerated plate shell element has four comer nodes, four <b>mid-side</b> nodes and one central node on the mid-surface of the shell geometry with five degrees of freedom at each node.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} how the average mohair staple length (SL) differences between nine sampling sites vary between sex and flock, to identify differences in SL variability between sampling sites as a result of between-animal and between-sire variability and to determine SL correlations between sampling sites in between-animal and between-sire variability. Australian Angora goats (n= 301) from two farms in southern Australia were sampled at 12 and 18 months of age at nine sites (mid side, belly, brisket, hind flank, hip, hock, mid back, neck and shoulder). Staples were taken prior to shearing at skin level and stretched SL determined. For each shearing, differences in SL between sampling sites, how these differences were affected by farm, sex and sire, and the covariance between sites for sire and individual animal effects were investigated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analyses. The median <b>mid-side</b> SL at 12 and 18 months of age was 110 and 130 mm, respectively, but the actual range in <b>mid-side</b> SL was 65 – 165 mm. There was an anterior–posterior decline in SL with the hock being particularly short. There was no evidence that the between-site correlation of the sire effects differed from 1, indicating that genetic selection for SL at one site will be reflected in SL over the whole fleece. However, low heritabilities of SL at the hock, belly and brisket or at any site at 12 months of age were obtained. There was more variability between sites than between sires, but the between-animal variation was greater. The hip and mid-back sites can be recommended for within-flock (culling) and genetic selection for SL due to their low sampling variability, moderate heritability and ease of location. <br /...|$|E

To help alleviate this problem, a new objective function for optimization-based smoothing is proposed for triangular and quadrilateral elements, linear or quadratic. Unlike the current popular approaches, this objective function makes it possible for a smoothing algorithm to untangle and smooth in a single process. This objective function has higher order continuous derivatives and only one minimum, if any, that make it suitable for optimization techniques. Even though optimization-based smoothing obtains much higher quality results compared to other algorithms, such as constrained Laplacian smoothing, it is also slower than these algorithms. That said, we also present an effective way {{to limit the number of}} calls to optimization-based smoothing such that the highest quality mesh is obtained in the least amount of time...|$|E
