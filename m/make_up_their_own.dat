5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E

25|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians {{supported}} capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now {{so that it would}} not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents though, thought that the death penalty was a useful tool to deter crime and terrorism. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response to the calls for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> minds, and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{some basic}} {{concepts}} of multimodal transportation and swarm intelligence were described and reviewed and analyzed related literatures of multimodal transportation scheme decision and swarm intelligence methods application areas. Then, this paper established a multimodal transportation scheme decision optimization mathematical model based on transportation costs, transportation time, and transportation risks, explained relevant parameters and {{the constraints of}} the model in detail, and used the weight coefficient to transform the multiobjective optimization problems into a single objective optimization transportation scheme decision problem. Then, this paper is proposed by combining particle swarm optimization algorithm and ant colony algorithm (PSACO) to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of multimodal transportation scheme decision for the first time; this algorithm effectively combines the advantages of particle swarm optimization algorithm and ant colony algorithm. The solution shows that the PSACO algorithm has two algorithms’ advantages and <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> problems; PSACO algorithm is better than ant colony algorithm in time efficiency and its accuracy is better than that of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is proved to be an effective heuristic algorithm to solve the problem about multimodal transportation scheme decision, and it can provide economical, reasonable, and safe transportation plan reference for the transportation decision makers...|$|R

Heldal-Lund commented, [...] "People {{should be able to}} have easy access to both sides and <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> opinions. Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion." [...] He also stated that [...] "Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card ...

It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Frank and Roo {{decide to}} get married because she is pregnant. Downing said that the serial was {{approaching}} sex before marriage in a liberal way. The writers dealt with it [...] "sensibly" [...] because Frank and Roo <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> minds. She added {{that it was important}} to let teenagers show their maturity if they want to marry. Roo keeps her baby's paternity a secret until the wedding day. In the middle of exchanging vows, Roo decides to be honest and tells Frank the truth. A wedding scenario had been planned for Roo, by the serial's writing team from the off-set. Bateman said that the wedding was not just to attract more viewers. He opined that people think that weddings were always based on the [...] "consummation of love". Roo and Frank's wedding highlighted that it does not always work that way. The wedding episode resulted in a ratings boost and heightened media interest for Home and Away. Magazines and newspapers labelled it as a [...] "shotgun wedding". Frank and Roo's wedding storyline was also covered by TV Week as their main story. Papps and Clarke were the first ever Home and Away cast members to feature on the cover of the magazine. Papps told J Clayden that Frank would never get over Roo lies about the baby's father. When Frank learns the truth, he leaves Roo at the altar. He then crashes his car and which leaves Frank in a coma.|$|E

60|$|The fifth {{thing to}} be considered, is, {{that the members of}} the grand jury being merchants, and {{principal}} shopkeepers, can have no suitable temptation offered them, as a recompense for the mischief they will suffer by letting in this coin, nor can be at any loss or danger by rejecting the bill: They do not expect any employments in the state, to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> private advantage, the destruction of their country. Whereas those who go about to advise, entice, or threaten them to find that bill, have great employments, which they have a mind to keep, or to get greater, which was likewise the case of all those who signed to have the author prosecuted. And therefore it is known, that his grace the Lord Archbishop of Dublin,[1] so renowned for his piety, and wisdom, and love of his country, absolutely refused to condemn the book, or the author.|$|R
50|$|The Lebanese Forces' early {{armoured}} corps in 1977 inherited a motley collection of captured light tanks, Charioteer tanks, M42 Duster SPAAGs, APCs, and some models of locally tailored armoured cars {{from the old}} Kataeb Regulatory Forces or handed over by the other, recently incorporated Christian factions. Thanks to the steady influx of Israeli aid, it grew from a small battalion to a powerful {{armoured corps}} by June 1982, capable of aligning some forty M50 Super Sherman medium tanks, twenty-two Ti-67 TIRAN (Israeli-modified T-54/55s) MBTs (other sources list a total of thirty-six Ti-67s on the LF inventory), M3/M9 Zahlam half-tracks, M113 and BTR-152 APCs. Following the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) withdrawal from west Beirut in October 1982, the LF salvaged seven UR-416 armoured cars {{left behind by the}} departing PLO forces, from which one vehicle was later captured by the Popular Nasserite Organization (PNO) militia during the battle for the Sidon bridgehead in 1985. The collapse of the Lebanese Army again in February 1984 allowed the LF to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> losses incurred in the 1983-84 Mountain War by seizing seven M48A5 MBTs, five AMX-13 light tanks, and twelve Panhard AML-90 armoured cars. Later in the war, sixty-four T-54A, T-55A and T-62 tanks, along with eighteen BTR-60PB (8x8) APCs were received from Iraq via Jordan; a few M577 command vehicles and Panhard M3 VTT armoured personnel carriers were also seized from the Lebanese Army. The LF also fielded three Soviet-built ZSU-23-4M Shilka Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns (SPAAG) captured from the PLO in West Beirut early in 1982, which they employed in their battles for control of east Beirut at the last phase of the war in 1988-90.|$|R

The [...] "Allen's Alley" [...] stereotypes make some cringe, as Allen biographer Robert Taylor noted (in Fred Allen: His Life and Wit), but others find them lancing more than lauding stereotypes, letting listeners <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> minds about how foolish they could be. [...] "Interestingly enough," [...] wrote Frank Buxton and Bill Owen in The Big Broadcast 1920-1950, [...] " [...] were never criticized as being anti-Southern, anti-Semitic, anti-New England or anti-Irish.

2500|$|In turn, {{allowing}} {{federal courts}} to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> independent judge-made law only made the problem worse. [...] Parties who felt disadvantaged {{by a state}} judge-made rule could create diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts by simply moving to another state or reincorporating there (if a party was a corporation). [...] In the worst cases a party who had lost in {{the state supreme court}} would simply begin all over again in federal courts; since the federal district court had its own set of common law rules, it could hold it was not bound by the state supreme court ruling.

2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds {{that what is}} at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E

2500|$|With the long-time {{popularity}} of the label cockapoo, used since at least 1960 and constructed by combining elements of its two contributing breeds (Cocker Spaniel/Poodle), it has become extremely common to find crossbred dogs given labels likewise invented by portmanteau.

None of these have become recognised by any major registry as purebred breeds. However, as of 2006, the portmanteau words cockapoo and Labradoodle are found in some dictionaries.
