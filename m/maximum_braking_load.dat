40|$|In {{the field}} of {{numerical}} crash simulations in road safety research, {{there is a need}} to accurately define the initial conditions of a frontal impact for the car occupant. In particular, human models used to simulate such impacts barely take into account muscular contracting effects. This study aims to quantify drivers'behaviour in terms of posture and muscular activity just before a frontal impact. Experiments on volunteers were performed in order to define these conditions, both on a driving simulator and on a real moving car. <b>Brake</b> pedal <b>loads,</b> lower limbs kinematics and muscle activation were recorded. Coupling instantaneous data from both experimental protocols (simulator versus Real car), a standard emergency braking configuration could be defined as (1) joint flexion angles of 96 ◦, 56 ◦ and 13 ◦ for the right hip, knee and ankle respectively; (2) a <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> pedal <b>load</b> of 780 N; (3) a muscular activation of 55 % for the anterior thigh, 26 % for the posterior thigh, 18 % for the anterior leg and 43 % for the posterior leg. The first application of this research is the implementation of muscle tone in human models designed to evaluate new safety systems.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The braking torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required braking torque and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required braking torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required braking torque is to be equal to the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque. In the case of normal braking, the command braking torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required braking torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque and the command braking torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required braking torque is smaller than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required braking torque is bigger than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

40|$|The {{brake torque}} of a direct-{{injection}} diesel engine {{is known to}} plateau over a range of injection timings. Injection timing affects the engine?s ignition delay and the fractions of fuel which burn in premixed and diffusion modes. Therefore, the characteristics of combustion for swept injection timings along the <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> torque plateau are determined. The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition. These results are significant in diesel engine design because cheaper, lighter engines may be built if desired <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> torque may be produced with lower peak in-cylinder pressures. More critically, different emissions composition profiles exist for the desired <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> torque, which will allow designers to choose injection calibrations which favor some emissions over others. In fact, both favorable emissions and in-cylinder pressure criteria {{can be achieved by}} implementing more retarded timings along the brake torque plateau without losses in efficiency or power output...|$|R
