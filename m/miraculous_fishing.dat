By listening to a conversation among the natives he finds out that the ingenious invention has become the property of Pigliatutto, {{the owner of the}} island. He introduces himself with some presents to Pigliatutto, who mistakes him for someone else he is expecting. Vinerblut pretends to be an itinerant clairvoyant luminary and predicts a terrible fate for the island and its inhabitants, promising {{at the same time to}} deliver an antidote.|$|E

50|$|Legend {{has it that}} {{near where}} he was living, a <b>miraculous</b> <b>fish</b> would present itself to Saint Corentin in a fountain. He would cut {{a small piece of}} the fish to feed himself, and that piece would regrow (he would {{otherwise}} feed himself with herbs and roots found in the forest). Corentin also fed the king Gradlon and his court, on a day when they had gotten lost during a hunt and had stumbled across Corentin.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the number}} of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, 154, is {{possibly}} related to the figure 153 of the <b>miraculous</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Gospel (John, XXI, 1 - 14), as was pointed out by A. Fowler (1970), T. P. Roche (1989) and is mentioned in K. Duncan-Jones edition (1997), precedents {{in the use of}} this figure in can - zonieri by Continental Petrarchists and in other genres are ignored by students of early modern English poetry. This paper continues previous work on elements of the numerological exegesis of Augustine of Hippo (In Iohann. evang. tract., 122) in Juan Boscán’s Libro II (1543) – the first canzoniere to be printed in Spanish- and in Petrarch’s Canzoniere as a precedent. The paper calls for a revaluation of the influence of Spanish Petrarchism on English poetry in this period, and advances some proposals which will be futher substantiated in the forthcoming book Composición numérica, petrarquismo y redención («Numerological Composition, Petrarchism and Redemption»). The paper ends with a brief interpretation of an ottava rima by Thomas Wyatt, written on his leaving Spain in 1939, which is considered here a veiled homage to Garcilaso de la Vega...|$|E
40|$|In 1938 Franjo Fancev {{published}} two epistles of Marko Marulić Pecinić adressed to the Benedictine nun Katarina Obirtić. By {{that time}} they had remained unoticed by literary historians, owing to {{the simple fact that}} the copist wrongly spelt Marulić’s second surname Pecinić as Peunić. Unfortunately, both epistles have been preserved but fragmentarily. Only {{the end of the first}} one has been preserved, while the other one shows numerous lacunae. The addressee of the two epistles was a nun from the Benedictine monastery in which Marko’s sister Bira spent the last years of her life. In the second epistle, whose distant model was Saint Jerome’s epistle to Eustochium, written as a gift offered in return of gifts received (antidoron), Marko Marulić, after having received a fish from the nun, presented her with this essay treating of the fifth day of the Creation, the five senses and the places in the Holy Scripture where the fish has been mentioned: Jonah, the <b>miraculous</b> <b>fishing,</b> the Apostles fishermen, the history of the Church. Written in warm and cordial words this fresh epistle is a true pearl of the Croatian epistolary literature...|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{instance}} of religious warfare was perpetrated by Nhu's right-hand man in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found {{swimming in a}} small pond near Đà Nẵng.

As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, Ngô family officials mined the pond and raked it with machine gun fire, but the fish survived. Nhu's special forces grenaded the pond, finally killing the fish. This backfired, however, because it generated more publicity — newspapers across the world ran stories about the <b>miraculous</b> <b>fish.</b> ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, and paratroopers filled their bottles with water they believed to be magical.|$|R

Tobias with his fish was an early type of baptism. Raphael leading Tobias always expresses protection, and especially protection to the young. The picture is believed to have been painted around 1512-14 to commemorate the introduction of Book of Tobit to the canonical books of the Roman Catholic Church. St. Jerome translated the Book of Tobit into Latin, which explains his presence on the right of Mary.|$|R

5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng.
