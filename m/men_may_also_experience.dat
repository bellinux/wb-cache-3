Men {{and children who}} are exposed to estradiol may develop symptoms of feminization, such as breast development, and <b>men</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> hypogonadism and infertility.

Estradiol should not be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who have breast cancer.|$|E

Online math courses therefore can be restructured to prevent math anxiety by catering to individual learning styles, providing tools that aid concept attainment, and using problem-based learning strategies. Adults {{returning to}} school face many challenges from balancing life and work schedules, to overcoming age-old math anxiety (Hembree, 1990). Math anxiety is defined as “an inability by an otherwise intelligent person to cope with quantification ” (Krantz, 1999, p. 100). Students who suffer with math anxiety start by doing poorly in mathematical courses, then avoiding such courses, and eventually choosing careers that require minimal math (Betz, 1978). At college level, math anxiety has many causes, including mathematics presented as fixed rules, passive classrooms, teaching styles that do not match learning styles, and students ’ lack of confidence and inability to see {{the relevance of the}} mathematical topics (Trujillo & Hadfield, 1999). Students who are too shy to ask questions or view mathematics as only for <b>men</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> math anxiety (Trujillo & Hadfield, 1999). Betz (1978) found 61 % to 68 % of student...|$|E
40|$|Transition to {{parenthood}} is {{a critical}} stage of life due to several changes the couple has to handle. A large body of studies described how transition to parenthood {{can be linked to}} the onset of depressive symptoms, as well as the perception of a low social support, and an increased stress, representing a risk for the early mother—baby relationship. Infant Massage (IM) emerged as an helpful tool to improve maternal skills in interacting with the baby, and leading toward a decreasing of post partum symptoms. However, a growing body of literature highlights that <b>men</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>experience</b> post-partum diseases, representing an additional risk {{for the development of the}} baby. To date, no study observed the impact of the infant massage on both partners. The aim of the current qualitative research is to observe the impact of the IM on a single couple of parents at childbirth. Pre (Time 1) and post-intervention (Time 3) procedure has been established to observe the changes occurring over the time in the couple. In particular, each member of the couple filled out the EPDS, the BDI-II, the MSPSS and the PSI-SF both at Time 1 and at Time 3. The treatment (Time 2) was represented by the IM training, and lasted 4 weeks. Findings revealed a decrease in depressive symptoms in both partners, as well as an improvement of their perception of stress related to parental role. No changes has been detected with respect to the perception of social support. The IM seems to be a helpful approach to prevent the establishment of pathological conditions in new parents. Although no direct measures on the child were used, the current qualitative data seem to suggest that the IM may represent a valuable tool to prevent the onset of early negative outcomes of the baby. Further investigations and empirical data are needed to improve the knowledge in this field...|$|R
