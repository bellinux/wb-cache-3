50|$|An ortho-mode {{transducer}} is also {{a component}} commonly found on high capacity terrestrial microwave radio links. In this arrangement, two parabolic reflector dishes operate in a point to point microwave radio path (4 GHz to 85 GHz) with four radios, two mounted on each end. On each dish a T-shaped ortho-mode transducer is mounted {{at the rear of}} the feed, separating the signal from the feed into two separate radios, one operating in the horizontal polarity, and the other in the vertical polarity. This arrangement is used to increase the aggregate data throughput between two dishes on a point to point <b>microwave</b> <b>path,</b> or for fault-tolerance redundancy. Certain types of outdoor microwave radios have integrated orthomode transducers and operate in both polarities from a single radio unit, performing cross-polarization interference cancellation (XPIC) within the radio unit itself.|$|E

The proposed model considers the combustion products in the exhaust plume, ambient air entrainment downstream of the nozzle, and a plasma attenuation model to estimate the total radio-frequency signal attenuation.

For example, if a <b>microwave</b> radio <b>path</b> fails for half-second intervals, the voting comparator may vote out that receiver site until silence is detected. This can cause dropped syllables in the voted audio.

Signal attenuation is aggravated in heavy rain climatic regions. As it has been experimentally verified, the long-term behaviour of rain attenuation induced on a <b>microwave</b> <b>path</b> in tropical regions is approximated by a gamma distribution. In this paper, the outage performance analysis of a satellite-terrestrial {{diversity reception}} system operating at frequencies above 10 GHz is presented, employing spatially correlated gamma fading channels.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed for the estimation of tropospheric <b>microwave</b> <b>path</b> delays from water vapor radiometer (WVR) data, which does not require site and weather dependent empirical parameters to produce accuracy better than 0. 3 cm of delay. Instead of taking the conventional linear approach, the new algorithm first uses the observables with an emission model to determine an approximate form of the vertical water vapor distribution, which is then explicitly integrated to estimate wet path delays in a second step. The intrinsic accuracy of this algorithm, excluding uncertainties caused by the radiometers and the emission model, has been examined for two channel WVR data using path delays and corresponding simulated observables computed from archived radiosonde data. It is found that annual rms errors {{for a wide range}} of sites average 0. 18 cm in the absence of clouds, 0. 22 cm in cloudy weather, and 0. 19 cm overall.

The intrinsic accuracy of this algorithm has been examined for two channel WVR data using path delays and stimulated observables computed from archived radiosonde data. It is found that annual RMS errors {{for a wide range}} of sites are in the range from 1. 3 mm to 2. 3 mm, in the absence of clouds. This is comparable to the best overall accuracy obtainable from conventional linear algorithms, which must be tailored to site and weather conditions using large radiosonde data bases.

Long-term rain rate statistics and rain rate duration statistics are usually available from meteorological data. In this paper, a spatial-temporal analysis is employed in order to evaluate the rain attenuation power spectrum of a terrestrial/ satellite path. The predicted power spectrum is compared with experimental data. Based on the spectral analysis of rainfall rate a method for converting rain rate duration statistics to link fade duration statistics is also proposed. Fade duration statistics are presented for terrestrial and satellite links and compared with available experimental data.

The use of trade names {{in this document}} {{does not constitute an}} official endorsement or approval of the use of such commercial hardware or software. Do not cite this document for advertisement. This article describes microwave line-of-sight radio, one of several transmission media in modern telecommunications networks. The topic is approached from two standpoints: the physics of microwave propagation and project implementation. Inasmuch as a microwave link is a circuit between terminals separated by a sizable distance, it can be considered a type of transmission line; but unlike copper or fiber optic cables, terrestrial microwave signals are propagated through the lower atmosphere. Thus they are sensitive to terrain, atmospheric, and climatic conditions adverse to error-free reception. An important part of microwave engineering is to account for these conditions and provide technical corrections. On the project side, constructing a microwave relay system is an interdisciplinary activity; besides <b>microwave</b> <b>path</b> and equipment engineering, several other engineering disciplines are required: civil engineering for site preparation and access roads; structural engineering for towers, foundations, supports, and buildings; and electrical engineering for power, lighting, and grounding...|$|E

40|$|In modern {{wireless}} mesh networks, the transmitted-information {{signals from}} the source node arrive at the final destination through relay stations. The introduction of relay stations into metropolitan-area networks allows the provision of ubiquitous broadband access, even in remote places, and increases the scalability potential. Due to the increased demand for bandwidth and the spectral congestion at low frequencies, these wireless mesh networks usually operate at frequencies above 10 GHz, satisfying the line-of-sight condition. In this frequency range, the most dominant fading mechanism degrading the availability of radio links and exposing spatial and temporal stochastic variation is rain attenuation. In this paper, the optimum placement of radio relays in a dual-hop configuration is studied, based on physical prediction models for the total outage probability. The {{focus is on the}} spatial inhomogeneity of rain attenuation over the converging <b>microwave</b> <b>paths,</b> which leads to the incorporation of the two-dimensional lognormal distribution.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a non-invasive method {{to measure the}} time an individual particle takes to move through a length of stainless steel pipe.

30|$|While the sporadic-E (Es) {{layer of}} the {{ionosphere}} has been attracting broad research interest since the 1930 s (e.g., Whitehead 1989; Mathews 1998; Haldoupis 2011), there still remain large uncertainties in {{the dynamics of the}} Es. Recently, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver data have been used to derive the total electron content (TEC) along the <b>microwave</b> propagation <b>path</b> between the GNSS satellite and receiver. Taking advantage of the dense GNSS receiver network data in Japan, Maeda and Heki (2014, 2015) derived the TEC anomalies associated with midlatitude Es episodes in Japan and demonstrated the detailed morphology and dynamics of Es. In terms of the spatial resolution in the observation of Es, however, satellite-based InSAR imaging is more advantageous than the GNSS network. Maeda et al. (2016) first succeeded in demonstrating an Es episode in Japan using both GNSS TEC and an InSAR image derived from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR). ALOS was launched in 2006 by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Another advantage of InSAR imaging is that no receivers have to be deployed on the imaging area, whereas the temporal resolution of InSAR is seriously limited by the satellite’s recurrence interval, which is 46  days in the case of ALOS/PALSAR.|$|R
