50|$|Dr Peter McBride FRSE (1854-1946) was a Scottish {{physician}} and {{expert on the}} larynx. In 1897 he was first to identify the <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the nose known as Granuloma Syndrome or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Edinburgh’s McBride Lecture was named in his honour in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The maxillary sinus {{is known}} for its thin floor walls and close {{proximity}} to the posterior maxillary teeth. Dental procedures such as extraction of these teeth sometimes cause OAC. The posterior maxillary molars and maxillary sinus are innervated by the same branch of nerves which is the maxillary division of trigeminal nerve. This innervation complicates the situation as the pain from maxillary sinus might be indistinguishable from a posterior maxillary toothache. Other known causes of OAC are fracture across the antral floor typically Le Fort I, displacement of posterior maxillary molar roots into antrum, and direct trauma. Extraction of primary teeth are not considered a risk of OAC due to the presence of developing permanent teeth and the small size of a developing maxillary sinus. OAC can happen for many other reasons, such as acute or chronic inflammatory lesions around the apex of tooth root present in close proximity with the maxillary antrum, necrotic lesions of the maxilla, failure of sublabial incision to heal after Caldwell-luc antrostomy, multiple and extensive fractures of the facial region, Osteomyelitis of the maxilla, injudicious use of instruments during oral procedures, malignancy of the maxillary sinus, Syphilis, <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma,</b> radiotherapy, implant denture, removal of a large cyst or resection of large tumour involving maxilla, development of tumour causing bone destruction and loosening of teeth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Manifestation of Hodgkin’s {{malignant}} disease in dogs {{has a low}} incidence in Romania. Detailed cyto-morphological analysis of canine Hodgkin’s <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma,</b> is particularly important, as it can avoid some diagnosis errors, in {{a significant number of}} anatomical and clinical forms of cancer disease with giant cells. It shows some representative images and details of comparative diagnosis and specific comment. There can be noticed that mono or polynuclear giant cells in dogs are associated with malignant cells in different locations, while in Hodgkin’s disease they are placed exclusively in <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma.</b> Diagnostic errors that can occur are discussed, according to the presented images...|$|E
40|$|The {{vaccine therapy}} is an {{adjuvant}} therapy combined with chemotherapy in stage III and IV <b>malignant</b> melanoma. <b>Granuloma</b> is {{a side effect}} of vaccines. Three stage IV patients were treated with the polyvalent vaccine consist of melanoma cell lysates. All patients have granulomas on injection sites with F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptakes on PET. Granuloma is an organized collection of macrophages. Macrophages contain intense Glut- 1 which is the most important deteminant of F- 18 FDG uptake in cells. Granulomas can mimic skin or lymph node involvement of malignant melanoma on F- 18 FDG PET...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{clinical}} studies have revealed {{the potential of}} [18 F]-fluoro-L-α-methyltyrosine (18 F-FAMT) for the differential diagnosis of malignant tumours from sarcoidosis. However, one concern regarding the differential diagnosis with 18 F-FAMT {{is the possibility of}} false negatives given the small absolute uptake of 18 F-FAMT that has been observed in some malignant tumours. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a usefulness of dynamic 18 F-FAMT positron emission tomography (PET) for differentiating <b>malignant</b> tumours from <b>granulomas.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a 61 -year-old Japanese {{woman who had}} been aware of a lesion on her left thigh for 10 years. Pathological examination demonstrated a well-circumscribed encapsulated nodule at the dermal-subcutaneous boundary, composed of eosinophilic spindle cell bundles, connective tissue, and numerous small vessels. Immunohistochemically, these eosinophilic cells were positive for a-smooth muscle actin. The granulomatous areas in the tumor were composed focally of epithelioid cells and lymphocytes. The epithelioid cells were negative for a-smooth muscle actin. We diagnosed this case as an angioleiomyoma with epithelioid <b>granuloma.</b> <b>Malignant</b> tumors with granulomatous change have sometimes been reported in the literature, but benign tumors with epithelioid granuloma, such as the present one, are rare. We thought that epithelioid cell granuloma might transform to angioleiomyoma through the action of IL- 1 released from vascular smooth muscle cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{their study}} of a case of lethal midline-granuloma, the authors {{describe}} the relations between this affection, Wegener’s granulomatosis and lymphoma. The case under review illustrates the difficulty in accurately defining the nosologic picture of the disease. Anatomo-pathological examinations present two possibilities: one being <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the Stewart type, the other that of lymphoma. From its subsequent evolution, we may eventually learn whether this is purely a local illness or represents the onset of a systemic disease. © 1979 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|Granuloma of {{the nose}} which does not heal is a {{tripartite}} disease, including classical <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma,</b> Wegener's granulomatosis, and a third group with neoplastic characteristics (granuloma gangrenescens). Five cases of this third type are described and 20 others from the literature are tabulated. The primary lesion is in the nasal or palatal region; after a latent period, metastases develop in many organs. The histological features are those of malignancy. Reasons are given for regarding the condition as a sarcoma of the reticulo endothelial system...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In a {{histological}} {{study of}} biopsy and postmortem material from 30 cases of nasal disease {{in which a}} clinical diagnosis of 'midline granuloma ' or Wegener's granuloma had been given, we selected 10 cases {{on the basis of}} the presence of widespread coagulative necrosis and atypical cells. Evidence is provided that such changes represent a malignant neoplasm of histiocytic lymphoma type. Local invasion and spread to cervical and more distant lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney were seen in some of the cases. Erythrophagocytic activity was marked in the spleen in three cases and histiocytic infiltration of the bone marrow in two cases, indicating a more generalised activity of histiocytic cells. Terms such as 'malignant granuloma ' should be abandoned. In obstructive and ulcerating conditions of the nose efforts should be concentrated on making an accurate histological diagnosis. A condition variously referred to as non-healing granuloma, midlinegranuloma, <b>malignant</b> <b>granuloma,</b> granuloma gangrenescens or Stewart's granuloma is characterised by a relentlessly progressive ulceration of the nose and adjacent structures...|$|E
30|$|Recently, Zhao et al. [11] {{reported}} {{the usefulness of}} dynamic PET imaging of L- 11 C-methionine (11 C-MET; {{the most frequently used}} amino acid tracer) for the differential diagnosis of <b>granulomas</b> from <b>malignant</b> tumours, in rat models. This tracer exhibited a significantly different dynamic profile in granulomas compared to tumours. The success of dynamic PET using 11 C-MET for the differential diagnosis raised the intriguing possibility that 18 F-FAMT could be used as an alternative amino acid PET tracer. However, the dynamic profile of 18 F-FAMT was unknown, and several characteristics of 18 F-FAMT, such as the mechanism of transport and metabolism, could lead to a dynamic profile distinct from that of 11 C-MET. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the usefulness of dynamic 18 F-FAMT PET for the differentiation of <b>malignant</b> tumours from <b>granulomas</b> in comparison with 18 F-FDG in an experimental rat model.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the space}} demands in the cerebellopontine angle lie extra-axially. Important {{structures}} run within the cisterns of the cerebellopontine angle, such as the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear nerves {{as well as the}} anterior inferior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and the veins which lead to the petrosal sinus. The most common space demands are caused by acoustic neuromas, meningeomas, vascular ectasia and aneurysms. Less common are epidermoid and other schwannomas as well as metastases, paragangliomas and arachnoidal cysts. Intra-axial tumours {{in the area of the}} cerebellopontine angle include the medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and the ependymoma, which occurs predominantly in children, in addition to the uncommon choroid plexus papilloma. Nearby, there are also space demands around the petrous bone, such as cholesterol <b>granuloma,</b> <b>malignant</b> otitis media, paraganglioma and metastases. For differential diagnosis, an understanding {{of the space}} requirements of the tumours in the cerebellopontine angle is needed in addition to knowledge of the anatomical structures...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{histological}} {{finding of}} pleural inflammation (pleuritis/fibrosis) is frequently found in pleural biopsies taken at thoracoscopy. This is a nonspecific finding, representing a common endpoint of many pleural conditions. Additional features, such as <b>malignant</b> cells, caseating <b>granulomas</b> {{and evidence of}} vasculitis, are required to make an aetiological histological diagnosis; {{in the absence of}} these features, the term 'nonspecific pleuritis/fibrosis' (NSP) is used. The cause of NSP is obscure and presents a particular dilemma: whether this apparently benign result represents a 'false-negative' sampling error in malignancy. RECENT FINDINGS: In a recent longitudinal follow-up study of 142 patients undergoing thoracoscopy, NSP was found in 31 %. Of these, a likely cause for the NSP was found in 38 % and malignancy occurred in 12 %. These data were consistent with previous studies. SUMMARY: NSP is a histological diagnosis made in approximately 30 - 40 % of patients with an undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion. The majority of cases adopt a benign course, although 8 - 12 % may be subsequently found to have malignancy, particularly mesothelioma. In 25 - 91 % no cause for the NSP is found; these patients are considered to have 'idiopathic pleuritis'. Prolonged follow-up, with occasionally further (usually more invasive) biopsies, is essential to rule out malignancy. © 2011 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma is a {{neoplasm}} {{that develops}} as multifocal lesions, often involving the skin, {{characterized by a}} complex histologic picture including numerous vascular spaces, perivascular and interstitial spindle-shaped cells, and extravasated erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Using an antibody against factor XIIIa, which identifies dermal dendrocytes, numerous factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes were detected among the spindle-shaped cells in 12 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -associated, and five non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes were also increased in histologic simulators of Kaposi's sarcoma such as dermatofibroma, angiomatoid <b>malignant</b> fibrous histiocytoma, <b>granuloma</b> annulare, and early wound healing, but were absent in keloids. The increased number of dermal dendrocytes, which are often in an angiocentric configuration and which also express CD 4, lymphocyte function associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1), and Leu M 3 in Kaposi's sarcoma, may be important to the angioproliferative response. The results suggested that the spindle-shaped cells that are present {{in a variety of}} cutaneous lesions are dermal dendrocytes and belong to the reticuloendothelial system, unlike other mesenchymal cell types such as the endothelial cell. Apparently a diverse array of stimuli, including human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) infection and trauma, can stimulate the accumulation of factor XIIIa expressing dermal dendrocytes in the skin. These cells can then participate in different stages of a variety of cutaneous alterations including Kaposi's sarcoma, dermatofibroma, granuloma annulare, and early wound healing. Thus, the factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocyte is a common cellular denominator among diverse clinical entities that share some histologic features...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{whether the}} dynamic profile of 11 C-MET {{may have an}} additional value in differentiating <b>malignant</b> tumors from <b>granulomas</b> in experimental rat models by small animal PET. Methods: Rhodococcus aurantiacus and allogenic rat C 6 -glioma cells were inoculated respectively into {{the right and left}} calf muscles to generate a rat model bearing both granulomas and tumors (n = 6). Ten days after the inoculations, dynamic 11 C-MET PET was performed by small-animal PET up to 120 min after injection of 11 C-MET. The next day, after overnight fasting, the rats were injected with 18 F-FDG, and dynamic 18 F-FDG PET was performed up to 180 min. The time-activity curves, static images, and mean standardized uptake value (SUV) in the lesions were calculated. Results: 11 C-MET uptake in the granuloma showed a slow exponential clearance after an initial distribution, while the uptake in the tumor gradually increased with time. The dynamic pattern of 11 C-MET uptake in the granuloma was significantly different from that in the tumor (p < 0. 001). In the static analysis of 11 C-MET, visual assessment and SUV analysis could not differentiate the tumor from the granuloma in all cases, although the mean SUV in the granuloma (1. 48 ± 0. 09) was significantly lower than that in the tumor (1. 72 ± 0. 18, p < 0. 01). The dynamic patterns, static images, and mean SUVs of 18 F-FDG in the granuloma were similar to those in the tumor (p = NS). Conclusions: Dynamic 11 C-MET PET has an additional value for differentiating malignant tumors from granulomatous lesions, which deserve further elucidation in clinical settings...|$|R
