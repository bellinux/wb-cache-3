500|$|In 1912, Moreno {{attended}} one of Sigmund Freud's lectures. [...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was in the}} perilous {{fires of}} the Carter {{administration}} that my ideology was forged," [...] she wrote. [...] "In the seventies, Carter taught <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> against, {{and then in the}} eighties, Reagan taught <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> for." [...] She also details why she {{went to work for the}} Internal Revenue Service. She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, [...] "from the inside out." [...] She also commented on her role as a Tea Party leader. [...] "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke," [...] she admitted. [...] "I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
6000|$|... "You hear!" [...] Herr Paul said, violently sarcastic: [...] "nothing {{she could}} have prevented! Enfin! Will you please tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much, I'm afraid," [...] {{replied the}} lieutenant. [...] "Well, then, don't talk nonsense, but tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to do to}} recover my little maid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This was {{the letter}} left for me," [...] whispered he, [...] "by a country fellow this morning. Look {{at it and}} tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 14, United States Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) {{stated that}} [...] "militarization {{of the police}} {{escalated}} the protesters' response." [...] St. Louis Chief of Police Sam Dotson stated {{he would not have}} employed military-style policing such as that which transpired. According to Chief Dotson, [...] "My gut told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself." [...] Another reason Dotson did not want the city and county police to collaborate was because of the history of racial profiling by police in that county. In an email to a St. Louis Alderman who brought up concerns of racial profiling, he wrote: [...] "I agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson." ...|$|E
60|$|B. came in just as I had got {{everything}} into a pile. He {{stared at the}} bed, and asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I told him I was packing.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{asked him}} {{what he was going to}} do about Footsack and the bottle of gin, which he countered by asking <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do with that diamond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I now {{hasten to}} the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that {{impressed}} me with feelings which, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been,</b> have made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Forgive the word, in one who ne'er [...] With such a word {{can more}} offend; [...] And since thy heart I cannot share, [...] Believe <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> thy friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} I didn't expect that," [...] replied Adrian in a fury. [...] "And now, {{if you have}} all the power you pretend, tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were nearly}} a minute insensible {{when you first}} fell, and when you {{recovered}} you only rested for about one second. After that you raved, and I invented suitable answers until you suddenly asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking about." ...|$|E
60|$|KATHERINE. Last {{night you}} used the word--bargain. Quite right. I meant to buy you. I meant to kill your faith. You showed <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I don't like to be shown up as a driver of bargains, Stephen.|$|E
6000|$|We sang {{some of his}} old Adventist hymns {{together}} and then he asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> planning to do. [...] "I haven't any definite plans," [...] I answered, [...] "except to travel. I want to travel. I {{want to see the}} world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leaping, you know, is a froglike accomplishment," [...] {{continued}} the Frogman modestly, [...] "but please tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to do when}} I reach {{the other side of}} the wall." ...|$|R
5000|$|If you ask <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> {{will answer}} either <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{mountain}} or river, {{but if you}} ask <b>me</b> <b>what</b> my heart <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> {{do not know how to}} answer. (24th statue) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} would," [...] said the Senor benevolently; [...] "but I see no present {{necessity}} for that, nor for any trouble whatever, {{if you will}} kindly tell <b>me</b> <b>WHAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{really are}} so cruel hard upon <b>me!</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to make}} {{inquiries}} was no more than, might you have any apprehensions--leastways beliefs or suppositions--that the company's property mightn't be altogether to be considered safe, if I used the house too regular?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] said Stacy. [...] "When you {{returned}} {{the other day}} you were bound to find <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> or a beggar. But nothing between. However," [...] he added, [...] "this {{has nothing to do}} with the forgery, or," [...] he smiled grimly, [...] "everything to do with it. Hush! Barker is coming." ...|$|E
60|$|With one {{man whom}} I had known in past days and who {{recognized}} me, I {{did manage to}} have a short talk. He asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing in Zululand at that time. I replied that I was {{on a visit to}} Zikali, whereon he said I should be safer with him than with any one else.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{a race of}} executioners, {{but we are not}} the unnurtured herd {{that people}} fancy. 'Tis the will of Berne that made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and no desire nor wants of my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is all rot,' he said, 'but {{without this}} I cannot show you, {{by virtue of}} my oath to Te-iki-pa, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean to show you. Now repeat after <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to trouble you," [...] said the old lady, on {{learning}} I could speak English and read German, [...] "but would you mind telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and where <b>I</b> have to go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] cried she. [...] "Let us wed, even at {{the door}} of the sepulchre! My life is gone in vanity and emptiness. But at its close there is one true feeling. It has made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in youth; it makes me worthy of you. Time is no more for both of us. Let us wed for Eternity!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He fixed {{me for a}} {{long time}} without {{replying}} and then spoke with a weak extravagance and with such pauses between his words as might have represented the slow prompting of an inner voice. [...] "You asked me when you first knew <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> 'Nothing,' I said, 'nothing of any consequence.' Nothing I've always supposed myself to be. But I've wronged myself--I'm a great exception. I'm a haunted man!" ...|$|E
60|$|So I made {{my sweet}} girl lean upon my shoulder--how little {{thinking}} what was heavy on her mind!--and I {{said she was}} not quite well, and put my arm about her, and took her upstairs. When we were in our own room, and when she might perhaps have told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so unprepared to hear, I gave her no encouragement to confide in me; I never thought she stood in need of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} ruin of my life," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "Help me; tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to do; <b>I</b> have, alas! neither the virtues of a priest nor the dexterity of a rogue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't fair. He {{ought to}} tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> accused of," [...] I cried, [...] "Every {{one who is}} arrested {{has a right to}} know that. I have done no wrong and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{one thing}} to the other, I came at last to the bundle of letters at the bottom--the letters of the man for whom I once sacrificed and {{suffered}} everything; {{the man who has}} made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "To tell ye the truth, I wouldn't {{have bothered}} about this," [...] {{explained}} old Grisley, {{in a burst}} of confidence; [...] "but, you see, Fogg knew the mortgage was due and he come to me and asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> goin' to do about it. And then when word come that your money had been stolen, he told me that I'd better foreclose or otherwise I might git next to nothin'." ...|$|E
60|$|They asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French; but I {{understood}} none of them; {{but at last}} a Scots sailor, who was on board, {{called to}} me, and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they had me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods.|$|E
6000|$|O living always, always dying! [...] O the burials of me {{past and}} present, [...] O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, {{imperious}} as ever; [...] O <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;) [...] O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and [...] {{look at where}} I cast them, [...] To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind.|$|E
5000|$|... "Oh great one, {{to restore}} my power, tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> like. <b>I</b> will ask {{questions}} {{so that you}} can tell my story [...] [...] Every idea is a good idea, however simple or odd or rushed, because it is yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll quit pretending. I owe {{a little}} to the country that has made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and these new hardy wheats are going to play a big part in its development. I want to see them tried on the poorest land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the sake}} of mercy," [...] said Rebecca, [...] "tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to expect as the {{conclusion}} of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it my life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down cheerfully." ...|$|R
