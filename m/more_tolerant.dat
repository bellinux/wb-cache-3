5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes.

5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party.

They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake at least {{he is willing to}} try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> {{and the two of them}} get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
5|$|The decade from 1954 to 1964 was {{the most}} {{successful}} period in the ACLU's history. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. During the ACLU's bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight {{cases in which the}} ACLU was involved; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight. The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects. The ACLU's success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, <b>more</b> <b>tolerant,</b> and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of Transandinomys extends from eastern Honduras through Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela, generally west and north of the Andes. The ranges of the two species overlap, but are distinct. T.bolivaris occurs from Honduras mainly on the Caribbean side of Central America south to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador, up to 1800m (5900ft) above sea level. T.talamancae, which is found up to 1525m (5000ft) above sea level, is less widely distributed in Central America, as {{it is not known}} further north than northwestern Costa Rica, but is more widely distributed in South America, occurring into far southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela. It has also been recorded south of the Venezuelan Andes, in the narrow strip of forest between the Llanos and the mountains. Both species are forest rats, but whereas T.bolivaris is restricted to humid forest formations, T.talamancae apparently is <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of drier forest, which explains its wider South American distribution.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} event {{of his tenure}} in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike, a layman and very prominent member of his church, collided with him {{during the winter of}} 1675 to 1676. There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men, one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker insurgence into New England, whereas Pike was much <b>more</b> <b>tolerant</b> of their evangelism. Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637, Pike traveled all the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office. A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier. Pike had made certain claims of Wheelwright, to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court, and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright. Not easily rebuked, Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town, following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities.|$|E

40|$|Individual {{tree and}} stand basal area growth were studied in a {{thinning}} experiment established over two sites in subtropical eastern Australia. The experiment compared the less shade tolerant species Eucalyptus dunnii with the <b>more</b> shade <b>tolerant</b> Corymbia citriodora var. variegata, both grown in plantation monoculture. Growth was compared over a 2 ½− 3 year period that immediately followed thinning at 5 ½− 7 ½ years of age. Towards {{the end of}} the growth period, tree crown depths and leaf mass per unit area were measured at one site. Crown depth and leaf mass per area of C. citriodora were greater than of E. dunnii, characteristics consistent with a <b>more</b> shade <b>tolerant</b> species. Gross stand basal area growth of E. dunnii was faster than that of C. citriodora. Individual-tree basal area growth behaviour was consistent with inter-tree competition involving asymmetric competition for light. Opening the stand by thinning reduced inter-tree competition to near zero. In unthinned control stands, smaller, more shaded trees of C. citriodora were better able to retain their basal area growth rates than those of E. dunniiin the face of competition. In consequence, the <b>more</b> shade <b>tolerant</b> C. citriodoradeveloped a more evenly spread frequency distribution of tree diameters than less shade tolerant E. dunnii. This would have consequences for the assortment of log sizes that would be available ultimately from monocultures of the two species...|$|R
