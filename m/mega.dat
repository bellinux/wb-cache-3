5|$|Another Charizard {{appears in}} Pokémon X and Y, under the {{ownership}} of Alain. This Charizard can <b>Mega</b> Evolve into <b>Mega</b> Charizard X and has shown to be powerful by defeating 10 <b>Mega</b> Evolutions {{in a row and}} defeating Ash's Greninja, who had a type advantage. It also defeated Trevor's Charizard, who can easily <b>Mega</b> Evolve into <b>Mega</b> Charizard Y.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man is sent by his creator, Dr. Light, {{to defeat}} Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters. <b>Mega</b> Man crushes the eight new Robot Masters and then {{challenges}} Wily himself. During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves beneath his fortress and when <b>Mega</b> Man follows, attempts to trick <b>Mega</b> Man into thinking he is a space alien, but <b>Mega</b> Man defeats the alien revealing {{it to be}} a holographic projection device which malfunctions showing Dr. Wily at the controls. After the scientist begs for mercy, <b>Mega</b> Man spares Wily and returns home.|$|E
5|$|A platform-action game, <b>Mega</b> Man 3 {{follows the}} same format {{set forth by}} its two predecessors. The player, as <b>Mega</b> Man, must {{complete}} a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will {{throughout the rest of}} the game. <b>Mega</b> Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as <b>Mega</b> Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of <b>Mega</b> Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.|$|E
5|$|Charizard {{made its}} video game debut in 1996 with the Japanese release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is {{available}} only through Pokémon evolution from the starter Pokémon Charmander. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, and their remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Charizard is used by Red, who acts as the games' final boss. Charizard {{is one of several}} Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y that is able to use the new <b>Mega</b> Evolution mechanic, becoming either <b>Mega</b> Charizard X or <b>Mega</b> Charizard Y. It was given a <b>Mega</b> Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and Y. Charmander (along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Charizard's <b>Mega</b> Evolution.|$|E
5|$|Compilations {{that include}} the game are Sonic Compilation (1995) for the Sega <b>Mega</b> Drive/Genesis; Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn; Sonic <b>Mega</b> Collection (2002) for the Nintendo GameCube; Sonic <b>Mega</b> Collection Plus (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC; Sega Genesis Collection (2006) for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable; Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; and Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised <b>Mega</b> Man for {{its overall}} design, though {{the game was}} not a {{commercial}} success. <b>Mega</b> Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs. The game has since been included in game compilations and rereleased on mobile phones, console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled <b>Mega</b> Man Powered Up in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>Mega</b> Man 4 {{receiving}} positive critical reviews {{during its}} early 1990s release, {{the game is}} widely regarded today to represent a downward shift from {{the quality of the}} first three games in the series. The <b>Mega</b> Buster itself has been considered an overused mechanic by several sources. <b>Mega</b> Man 4 was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation, PlayStation Network, and mobile phones; the North American <b>Mega</b> Man Anniversary Collection; and worldwide on the Virtual Console for 3 Nintendo systems (Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of <b>Mega</b> Man 2 {{released}} two years earlier, <b>Mega</b> Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, <b>Mega</b> Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, {{and as part of}} various <b>Mega</b> Man franchise compilations.|$|E
5|$|Maverick Hunter is the codename for a {{cancelled}} first-person shooter {{video game}} in the <b>Mega</b> Man franchise {{that would have been}} developed by Armature Studio and published by Capcom. It was intended to be a darker entry in the <b>Mega</b> Man X series. <b>Mega</b> Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X {{in the first two games}} and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier <b>Mega</b> Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other <b>Mega</b> Man titles were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man & Bass debuted on {{the aging}} 16-bit Super Famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with <b>Mega</b> Man 8. Producer Keiji Inafune claimed <b>Mega</b> Man & Bass was created {{with regard to}} younger players who did not yet own {{one of the more}} {{advanced}} gaming systems. The game received positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though many found the difficulty to be too steep. Although <b>Mega</b> Man & Bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series, the ninth numbered title would not be released until 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man & Bass was {{originally}} available in Japan through the Nintendo Power game service in Lawson convenience stores. Its popularity prompted Capcom to later release {{the game in}} Super Famicom cartridge form. Until its GBA re-release, {{it was one of}} the few <b>Mega</b> Man titles not localized for English-speaking countries. The company commemorated the 15th anniversary of the <b>Mega</b> Man franchise with the GBA version of the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man & Bass, {{known in}} Japan as , is an action-platform video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Capcom. It is a spin-off title in the original <b>Mega</b> Man series and was originally released exclusively in Japan on April 24, 1998 for the Super Famicom. <b>Mega</b> Man & Bass was ported to the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld in 2002 and was localized in North America and PAL regions the following year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} <b>Mega</b> Man. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill <b>Mega</b> Man’s health at any time. Also introduced is a password system. After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, <b>Mega</b> Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man 2 is a {{platform}} and action game like its predecessor, <b>Mega</b> Man. The player controls <b>Mega</b> Man as he traverses eight stages {{to defeat the}} bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing {{the order in which}} the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, <b>Mega</b> Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow <b>Mega</b> Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man 2 {{takes place}} {{one year after}} the {{original}} <b>Mega</b> Man. After his initial defeat Dr. Wily, the series' main antagonist, creates his own set of Robot Masters in an attempt to counter <b>Mega</b> Man: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man; along with a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man 2, {{known in}} Japan as , is an action-platform game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second installment in the original <b>Mega</b> Man series. The game was released in Japan 1988 and in North America and PAL regions the following years. <b>Mega</b> Man 2 continues the titular protagonist's battle against the evil Dr. Wily and his rogue robots. The game features graphical and gameplay changes from the first <b>Mega</b> Man game, {{many of which have}} remained throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man 5 {{takes place}} during the 21st century, about {{two months after the}} events of <b>Mega</b> Man 4, when the mad {{scientist}} Dr. Wily once again attempted to take over the world. Proto Man, secret brother and once ally to the world's greatest hero <b>Mega</b> Man, leads an army of robots in a series of destructive attacks on the world. To cripple the world's defenders, he kidnaps his own creator, the genius scientist Dr. Light. <b>Mega</b> Man wonders why Proto Man is doing this, but with little choice left, he sets out to stop him, assisted by Beat, a robot bird gifted to him by Dr. Cossack.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man X has {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews for its gameplay, sound, and graphics, {{as well as its}} attempt to augment the aging <b>Mega</b> Man franchise. A longterm commercial success on the SNES, <b>Mega</b> Man X has since been ported to personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices, included in the North American <b>Mega</b> Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2), and released on the Virtual Console download service for the Wii, the Wii U, and the New Nintendo 3DS. The game also received a remake on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) titled <b>Mega</b> Man Maverick Hunter X. Nintendo re-released <b>Mega</b> Man X in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mega</b> Man X was {{developed}} by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running <b>Mega</b> Man series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted {{that the development of}} <b>Mega</b> Man X required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original <b>Mega</b> Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original <b>Mega</b> Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for <b>Mega</b> Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that <b>Mega</b> Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis {{represents}} Sega's {{entry into}} the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In Japan, Sega released the <b>Mega</b> Jet, a portable version of the <b>Mega</b> Drive designed for use on Japan Airlines flights. As a condensed version, the <b>Mega</b> Jet requires a connection to a television screen and a power source, and so outside of airline flights it is only useful in cars equipped with a television set and cigarette lighter receptacle.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Enker, who {{debuted in}} Dr. Wily's Revenge, {{appeared as a}} boss in the Game Boy game <b>Mega</b> Man V and as a playable character in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game <b>Mega</b> Man Soccer. A downloadable stage in <b>Mega</b> Man 10 features Enker as its boss and his Mirror Buster weapon as the reward for beating him.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy incarnation of the <b>Mega</b> Man series came {{after the release of}} <b>Mega</b> Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to <b>Mega</b> Man. The North American version of this game and the first DOS <b>Mega</b> Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple touch-up of <b>Mega</b> Man 3s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} {{arc of the}} <b>Mega</b> Man comic series adapts the {{original}} <b>Mega</b> Man game, though with certain artistic liberties, such as Dr. Wily's robot factory reusing the design of <b>Mega</b> Man 2s Wily Castle, <b>Mega</b> Man becoming obsessed with stopping the reprogrammed Robot Masters {{to the point of}} having an identity crisis, and Dr. Light mistaking a Sniper Joe controlled by Dr. Wily for Proto Man.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES <b>Mega</b> Man title and has similar gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero <b>Mega</b> Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. <b>Mega</b> Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter and a life meter. <b>Mega</b> Man can lose health by touching enemies or their projectiles, while lives will be lost when Lives will be consumed if <b>Mega</b> Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} the night was the main event between The <b>Mega</b> Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The <b>Mega</b> Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The <b>Mega</b> Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The <b>Mega</b> Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The <b>Mega</b> Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the <b>Mega</b> Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The <b>Mega</b> Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E
5|$|The odds of {{matching}} all six numbers {{to win the}} <b>Mega</b> Millions jackpot are 1 in 258,890,850. The odds of winning any prize are 1 in 14.7. As of September 2017, nine <b>Mega</b> Millions jackpots have been won in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The robot creator Doctor Light created two human-like robots with {{advanced}} artificial intelligence named <b>Mega</b> and Roll. Following this, he created eight more robots intended for industrial use: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, Elec Man, Time Man, and Oil Man. He received a Nobel Prize for Physics, and his old colleague and rival Doctor Wily has grown bitter {{for not being}} acknowledged {{for his work on}} the project. Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before <b>Mega</b> and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear energy supply to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight industrial robots to attempt world domination. <b>Mega</b> volunteered to stop Wily and the robots and was converted into a fighting robot called <b>Mega</b> Man. After defeating all eight robots, <b>Mega</b> Man goes through Dr. Wily's fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, he surrenders and asks <b>Mega</b> Man to spare him.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{defeating}} the eight Robot Masters — Toad Man, Bright Man, Pharaoh Man, Ring Man, Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man, and Drill Man — <b>Mega</b> Man {{makes his way}} to Cossack's icy fortress. However, {{in the middle of his}} battle with Cossack, <b>Mega</b> Man's brother Proto Man teleports in with Cossack's daughter, Kalinka. The girl begs <b>Mega</b> Man to stop fighting her father and elaborating that Dr. Wily had kidnapped her and forced her father into building an army of robots. With Wily's plan undone by Proto Man, he steps out of the shadows. <b>Mega</b> Man pursues his nemesis and fights through the scientist's Wily Castle, but Wily manages to escape in the end. <b>Mega</b> Man escapes as the fortress begins to self-destruct, and rides home on the top of a passing train, where he is greeted by Roll and Rush.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transition}} to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained {{that the development of}} <b>Mega</b> Man X involved reinventing <b>Mega</b> Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES <b>Mega</b> Man games that came before it, <b>Mega</b> Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character {{at the end of each}} stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, <b>Mega</b> Man X adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.|$|E
5|$|A Mewtwo, {{which was}} created by Mr. Fuji, appears in the anime miniseries Pokémon Origins, which is {{generally}} based on {{the plot of the}} video games Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. As such, Red goes to Cerulean Cave, and uses the <b>Mega</b> Evolution mechanic introduced in Pokémon X and Y to <b>Mega</b> Evolve his Charizard for the fight with Mewtwo, whom Red captures.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the evil Dr. Wily many times, the robotic hero <b>Mega</b> Man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light {{in order to}} create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, <b>Mega</b> Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. <b>Mega</b> Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sales for}} <b>Mega</b> Man were unimpressive, Capcom allowed the Rockman team {{to create a}} sequel. They worked {{concurrently}} on other Capcom projects, using their free time to develop the game. Unused content from the previous title was integrated into <b>Mega</b> Man 2. Takashi Tateishi composed the soundtrack, with Yoshihiro Sakaguchi serving as a sound programmer.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>Mega</b> Man, Capcom {{primarily}} made arcade games, {{and their}} console releases were mostly ports of these titles. In the mid-1980s, Capcom {{made plans to}} develop <b>Mega</b> Man specifically for the Japanese home console market. They decided to bring in fresh, young talent for the small team, including artist Keiji Inafune, a recent college graduate who started on the Street Fighter team. Inafune recalled that the <b>Mega</b> Man development team worked extremely hard to complete the final product, with a project supervisor and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of the game.|$|E
5|$|Between WWE and AAA, Hennigan {{has held}} a dozen total championships {{including}} two world championships (ECW World, AAA <b>Mega).</b>|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge is {{an action}} and {{platform}} game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) <b>Mega</b> Man games. The player is tasked with completing {{a series of}} four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be selected at will and used {{throughout the rest of}} the game. Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original <b>Mega</b> Man and <b>Mega</b> Man 2, including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism {{introduced}} the <b>mega</b> sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The <b>mega</b> sale event is held {{three times a}} year— in March, May and December— during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination in Asia.|$|E
