5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E

5|$|As Barbara {{moved toward}} the Canadian Maritimes, it began to undergo an extratropical transition, {{completing}} the transition by late on August15 just south of Nova Scotia. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August16. At this time, a trough developed to the southeast of the storm, and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland. A new low formed {{in association with the}} trough, and as Barbara rapidly headed northward, the developing center <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> slowly. However, the new low quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems. Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity, dissipating late on August16.|$|E
30|$|The result further {{indicated}} that on Thursdays, from 6  am through to 12 noon, the taxis seem to <b>move</b> <b>more</b> than the private cars.

Finally, on weekends, the movement of taxis seems to be more than the private cars in Nanjing. Nonetheless, from 4  pm to 7  pm the private cars <b>move</b> <b>more</b> than the taxis during weekends.|$|R

50|$|Eat Smart, <b>Move</b> <b>More,</b> Weigh Less is a 15-week adult weight {{management}} program that uses strategies {{based on evidence}} for weight loss and/or weight maintenance. The Eat Smart <b>Move</b> <b>More</b> Weigh Less classes focus on the 12 evidence-based eating and physical activity behaviors for weight management. The program {{does not provide a}} prescriptive diet plan, it teaches small lifetime changes. The program teaches mindfulness as a strategy to become more aware of eating and physical activity. Eat Smart, <b>Move</b> <b>More,</b> Weigh Less includes methods for planning and tracking healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. In 2007, Eat Smart, <b>Move</b> <b>More,</b> Weigh Less curriculum was developed by a writing team from NC State University and NC Division of Public Health. A complete listing of authors and their respective affiliations {{can be found on the}} program website. The 15-lesson curriculum was peer reviewed by state and local nutrition and physical activity professionals, representatives from the medical community, and a CDC project officer.|$|R
5|$|B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at {{an annual}} salary of $600 (today $) with {{perquisites}} of $400. By comparison, the kosher butcher's salary was $300, not including what he earned killing poultry. Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir, and was in effect the rabbi. Under his leadership, the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world. For example, at a congregational meeting in , they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering Moroccan Jews, and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf. The congregation also <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> towards Orthodoxy, and passed a rule stating that only those members who were Sabbath observant could receive Torah honors on the High Holy Days.|$|E
5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
5|$|Sarsgaard {{was born}} at Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois, the son of Judy Lea and John Dale Sarsgaard. His father was an Air Force {{engineer}} and later worked for Monsanto and IBM. His surname originates in Denmark, where two of his paternal great-great-grandparents were born. Sarsgaard was raised a Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy. His family <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> than 12 times during his childhood, following his father's job. At the age of 7, Sarsgaard originally {{wanted to become a}} soccer player and took up ballet to help improve his coordination. After suffering several bad concussions while playing soccer, he gave up the sport and became interested in writing and theater.|$|E

5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|With Roosevelt's help, Taft {{had little}} {{opposition}} for the Republican nomination {{for president in}} 1908, and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November. In the White House, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs, and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then {{a major source of}} governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> and more. Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates, and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of re-election; he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson's victory.|$|E
5|$|Based in Nui Dat, the SASR was {{responsible}} for providing intelligence to both the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, {{with each of the}} three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory. Operating in small groups of four to six men they <b>moved</b> <b>more</b> slowly than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter, with the SASR working closely with No. 9 Squadron RAAF which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height. On occasion, SASR patrols were also deployed by M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their drop-off point despite the noise they made moving through the jungle. An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.|$|E
