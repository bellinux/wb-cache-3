40|$|Diamond’s two-period OLG growth {{model is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the stock of capital in any period is equal to the wealth accumulated in the previous period by the generation of pensioners. This stock equlibrium condition may appear an innocuous paraphrase of the ordinary <b>macro-economic</b> <b>flow</b> equilibrium condition, S = I. This is not the case. In this note I demonstrate that Diamond’s solution is unstable in a monetary market economy where households and firms make independent decisions as to how much to save and how much to invest. An increase in the rate of interest above the Diamond long-run equilibrium level will cause saving to fall by more than investment and, hence, result in excess demand for loanable funds and an upward pressure on the rate of interest. However, substituting the ordinary S = I flow equilibrium condition for Diamonds stock equilibrium condition reveals that the model has another solution - the rate of interest equals the rate of growth - and that this solution is stable in a capital-based economy (contrary to the pure consumption loan model of interest suggested by Samuelson(1958)). The model has interesting implications. Diamond’s model predict that an increase in rate of time preference causing the young generation to save less will reduce the capital stock and raise the rate of interest. However,the S = I based two period OLG model reveals that the old generation’s consumption falls by more than the the young generation’s consumption increases. Consequently, excess supply of loanable funds will drive down the rate of interest. If the rate of interest is equal to the rate of growth an increase in the time preference has no effect on the supply of loanable funds and, consequently, neither on the rate of interest or the stock of capital. Whether people prefer to consume as young or old should not be a matter of public concern (although the transition from one state to another may be) ...|$|E
40|$|How do {{international}} currencies get {{established and}} consolidated? What {{domestic and international}} political foundations support an international currency? And what kinds of <b>macro-economic</b> <b>flows</b> enable an international currency? In this essay we consider these perennial questions of modern IPE scholarship in reverse order to ask whether the euro could ever have become, or seek to become, a true international currency rivalling the US dollar, used not only for passive foreign exchange reserves {{but also as a}} major commercial currency outside the EU. We argue that the EU lacks the will, the ideas and the capacity to promote the euro into the status of an international currency. In this article, we concentrate on this final issue of capacity, as the will and ideas issues have already been well explored. Capacity is an issue coeval with, if not prior to, the first two issues. The EU's current institutional arrangements and its economic geography create macro-economic consequences that diminish the euro's capacity to operate as a top currency. These conflicts go beyond the well-recognized issue that the euro-zone is not an optimum currency area. Examining the euro's debilities sheds light not only on the euro's (in) capacity to rival the dollar as an international currency, but also on the future of both the euro and the dollar {{in the aftermath of the}} euro-zone crisis...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{integration}} policies {{should take}} the language skills of arriving migrants into account. However, {{little is known about}} the determinants of these skills, because most survey-based studies cannot distinguish between language learning before and after migration. We present a new dataset which reports the extent of language course and exam participation at the German Goethe institutes in 91 countries for the period 1966 2013. The dataset allows for a detailed examination of the determinants and consequences of adult language learning on the institute and country level. We estimate a fixed-effects model for the relationship between language learning and a set of <b>macro-economic</b> variables. Immigration <b>flows</b> are positively correlated with exam participation. Additionally, in EU countries, migrant stocks are positively correlated with course and exam participation. They may act as a proxy for otherwise unobserved short-term migration and cultural ties, both of which could influence language learning decisions. In non-EU countries, the link between migration and language learning is strengthened by two factors: By positive economic conditions, indicating that migrants who leave amidst economic turmoil may arrive with worse language skills. And by linguistic distance, indicating that migrants react to distance by increasing learning effort instead of refraining from learning the language...|$|R
