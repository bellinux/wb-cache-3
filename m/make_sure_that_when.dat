The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

40|$|In {{order for}} a power system to {{function}} properly, {{it is necessary that}} the power production is equal to the power demand at all times. The next day's power balance is scheduled by the transmission system operators (TSO's) {{as a result of what}} the power consumers and producers declare they want to buy and sell. However, unpredictable events are bound to happen. Therefore there are additional controls using three frequency reserve markets; primary, secondary, and tertiary reserves. The focus in this master's thesis is secondary frequency control, which uses Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR). Today there is one central proportional-integral controller handling the secondary frequency control of the entire Nordic power system. In this thesis a design and analysis of an alternative control structure is presented. A simplified version of the Nordic synchronous system comprising eleven areas is modeled using Simulink. The areas consist of one generator in accordance with the installed power generation per area, and one load equal to the value during an actual high load hour. The model uses a combination of the swing equation and DC power flow to do the network calculations. Three Automatic Generation Controllers (AGC's) are included in the system for decentralized secondary frequency control. The input to the controllers is the frequency deviation, and the power flow and capacities in specific tie lines between the areas; while the output is the change in power production. The AGC's are modeled as classical AGC's with a few modifications. The most important modification of the AGC's is that the tie line power flow is only taken into account when the power flow in the tie lines exceed the capacity limits. In other words, the Area Control Error (ACE) only regards the system frequency and is common for the entire system as long as there are no congestions in the controlled tie lines. The system is split into two or more areas operating with individual ACE's when congestions occur. The activation of secondary frequency control is based on a merit order list comprised of available volumes and prices of the aFRR in each bidding zone. Hence, the control structure <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> disturbances occur, the cheapest available aFRR is activated. The activation depends on whether there are any congestions. When the power transfer in any of the tie lines exceed the capacity limits, aFRR is instead activated in areas where the congested line is not a hindrance. As secondary frequency control is relatively new in the Nordic power system, it is currently paid for by all the Nordic TSO's. By implementing AGC's in all bidding zones, the areas experiencing disturbances will be the ones actually paying for frequency restoration by purchasing the cheapest aFRR available. The Nordic countries and areas would be in control of their own ACE, in addition to cooperating by buying and selling aFRR. One of the simulated cases in this thesis shows that AGC's in only three areas is not enough because other than the three controlled tie lines may be congested. If the proposed solution is to be implemented in the Nordic power system, an important challenge in the control structure is to control as many tie lines as possible in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no grid capacities are exceeded...|$|R
500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene. As the {{popularity}} of 80's pop gave way to alternative rock, Yankovic {{decided it was time}} to record a parody of the Seattle-based band's huge hit single [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic later said, [...] "I wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I came back after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn't until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender." [...] To secure permission for the parody, Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain. After learning that Nirvana was to perform on Saturday Night Live, Yankovic called up his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, who was, at the time, a regular cast member on the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was [...] "going to be a song about food". [...] Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how [...] "no one can understand [...] lyrics" [...] to the original, which Cobain thought was funny. After receiving permission, Yankovic wrote and recorded [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] on January 27, 1992.|$|E
