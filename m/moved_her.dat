5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, she changed tack, and was reconciled with the Grand Ducal family. That particular reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 of Anna Maria Luisa.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, {{as it was}} {{becoming}} clear that Mao Zedong's Communists were winning the Chinese Civil War, Xu Lai <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> family from Shanghai to British Hong Kong, while Tang Shengming went to Changsha to join the surrender of Hunan Governor Cheng Qian to the Communists. His brother Tang Shengzhi also surrendered. In 1950, Tang Shengming was appointed deputy commander of 21st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army and fought battles against the Kuomintang troops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1815 Austen <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> {{work from}} Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who {{published}} Emma in December 1815 {{and a second}} edition of Mansfield Park in February 1816. Emma sold well but the new edition of Mansfield Park did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from Emma. These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte {{had been}} her sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a {{document}} declaring that the children were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname. Soon after, Juana <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> children to a one-room apartment in Junín. To pay the rent on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.|$|E
5|$|Smith's third {{victim was}} Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old care home worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work. Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, {{fracturing}} her hip. Fearing {{that he would be}} caught, Smith <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8:50am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank.|$|E
5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.|$|E

5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogotá, a subject that deeply <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E
5|$|For 2011, Robson hired a new coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, and <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> working base to Paris. Her {{season was}} {{disrupted}} by injury at the Hopman Cup {{and she did}} not compete in a tournament until March 2011; her comeback was then delayed for a further month by an injury in her second competition. Returning again at the end of April 2011, Robson's best performance to date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{began her}} 2017 {{season at the}} Auckland WTA International, but lost {{in the first round}} of {{qualifying}} to Tereza Martincová.

She then played an ITF $60,000 tournament at Andrézieux-Bouthéon and reached the quarterfinals, before losing in straight sets to Amra Sadiković. Between the end of January and the beginning of May, Robson reached three quarterfinals on the ITF circuit. Robson won the biggest title of her career at an ITF $60,000 tournament in Kurume, defeating fellow Briton Katie Boulter in straight sets. The tournament win <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> up 80 places in the ranking, causing her to reach the top 200 for the first time since 2014.|$|E

5|$|After {{a three-month}} hiatus from television, Fox resurfaced on the November 18 episode of ECW, {{managing}} English wrestler DJ Gabriel, in a fan favorite role. Their on-screen association was explained by WWE claiming that Fox had <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> wedding planning business to England during her hiatus from WWE television, {{where she had}} met Gabriel. Gabriel and Fox began feuding with the Burchill siblings (Paul and Katie Lea) in late December 2008. Fox made her ECW in-ring debut on January 6, 2009, in a loss to Katie Lea. The following week, Gabriel and Fox defeated the Burchill siblings in a mixed tag team match, giving Fox her first win {{as part of the}} brand. In March, Fox and Gabriel feuded with Tyson Kidd and Natalya, with Natalya defeating Fox on March 3 episode of ECW. Fox competed in the 25 Diva battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, which was ultimately won by Santina Marella.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had <b>moved</b> <b>her</b> to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{conversion}} disorder (such as hystericalparalysis) has always been controversial (Ron, M. A. (1996). Somatization and conversion disorders. In: B. S. Fogel, R. S. Schiffer & S. M. Rao (Eds.), Neuropsychiatry. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD). Although the diagnosis is recognised by current psychiatric taxonomies, many physicians still regard such disorders either as feigned or as failure to find the responsible organic cause for the patient's symptoms. We report a woman with left sided paralysis (and without somatosensory loss) in whom no organic disease or structural lesion could be found. By contrast, psychological trauma {{was associated with the}} onset and recurrent exacerbation of her hemiparalysis. We recorded brain activity when the patient prepared to move and tried to <b>move</b> <b>her</b> paralysed (left) leg and when she prepared to move and did <b>move</b> <b>her</b> good (right) leg. Preparing to <b>move</b> or moving <b>her</b> good leg, and also preparing to <b>move</b> <b>her</b> paralysed leg, activated motor and/or premotor areas previously described with movement preparation and execution. The attempt to move the paralysed leg failed to activate right primary motor cortex. Instead, the right orbito-frontal and right anterior cingulate cortex were significantly activated. We suggest that these two areas inhibit prefrontal (willed) effects on the right primary motor cortex when the patient tries to <b>move</b> <b>her</b> left leg...|$|R
