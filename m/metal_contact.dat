This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions (Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008. This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%.

25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two <b>metal</b> <b>contact</b> plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters.

A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the carbon pile controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|E
2500|$|A full area <b>metal</b> <b>contact</b> is made on {{the back}} surface, and a grid-like <b>metal</b> <b>contact</b> made up of fine [...] "fingers" [...] and larger [...] "bus bars" [...] are {{screen-printed}} onto the front surface using a silver paste. This is an evolution of the so-called [...] "wet" [...] process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by Bayer AG. The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or [...] "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front, and a polymer encapsulation on the back.|$|E

Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as resonant tunneling diode. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by resonant tunneling through two or more potential barriers (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to Fermi level, tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases.
