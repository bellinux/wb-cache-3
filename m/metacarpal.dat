5|$|The forelimbs were {{proportionally}} {{shorter than}} in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like <b>metacarpal</b> that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like <b>metacarpal</b> as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|The only {{overlapping}} material between BMNH R3078 and the holotype of Cetiosauriscus leedsi is an ilium. However, in both specimens the ilium was {{preserved in}} insufficient ways. Since the only overlapping material {{was impossible to}} compare, Charig found that BMNH R3078 was of a different species and he named it Cetiosauriscus stewarti. <b>Metacarpal</b> 1 is short and massive, with the prominent process on {{the lower part of}} the posterior margin of the lateral face, a characteristic of the diplodocoids Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Dicraeosaurus.|$|E
50|$|In four-legged animals, the <b>metacarpals</b> {{form part}} of the forefeet, and are {{frequently}} reduced in number, appropriate {{to the number of}} toes. In digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the <b>metacarpals</b> are greatly extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature that typically enhances the animal's speed. In both birds and bats, the <b>metacarpals</b> {{form part of}} the wing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>metacarpals</b> of neosauropods {{are bound}} together, {{allowing}} a digitigrade posture with the manus raised {{up off the}} ground. Prosauropods and basal sauropods have <b>metacarpals</b> which are articulated at the base, but this is further developed in neosauropods such that the articulation continues down the shafts. The ends of the <b>metacarpals</b> also form a tight arch with wedge-shaped shafts fitting closely together.|$|R

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large <b>metacarpal</b> (cannon), small <b>metacarpal</b> (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1974 season, pitching to a 3–8 win-loss record and 4.54 ERA through July 10. Subsequently he won eight consecutive games and nine out of ten, pitching seven completed games in that ten-game stretch. A line drive off of the bat of Willie Montañez fractured the fifth <b>metacarpal</b> bone in Ellis' pitching hand on September 10, prematurely ending his season. Ellis had the seventh best walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (1.155). The Pirates won the NL East, but they lost the 1974 NLCS three games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support the massive head. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers, along with an {{additional}} small <b>metacarpal</b> representing the remnant of a third digit. In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance the massive head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E
40|$|Shortening of <b>metacarpals</b> is {{a useful}} {{diagnostic}} marker in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia) with Albright′s hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) phenotype or pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP). There are very rare reports of <b>metacarpals</b> shortening in idiopathic primary hypoparathyroidism (IPH) cases in the literature. Here we described {{a young woman with}} IPH who presented with hypocalcaemia and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She had shortening of forth and fifth <b>metacarpals</b> which was prominent in her right hand. Based on our finding and other previous case reports we conclude that metarpals shortening is not a specific finding of PHP-Ia or PPHP and it may be found in IPH cases...|$|R

5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular <b>metacarpal</b> to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
5|$|It is {{plausible}} that ceratosaurians underwent BDR {{independent of the}} tetanurans, and therefore has no bearing {{on the issue of}} avian digit homology. In particular, as demonstrated by teratological analysis, the abbreviation (mesomelia) and loss of digits (hypophalangia) in the forelimb of Limusaurus is likely the result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout the evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians, and is unconnected to the pattern of digital reduction and frameshift that occurred in tetanurans. This is supported by the hands of the ceratosaurians Ceratosaurus, Berberosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus having plesiomorphic (i.e. more similar to the ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs) <b>metacarpal</b> bones comparable to those of the more basal theropod Dilophosaurus. The divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function; tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping, while the hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played no role in predation.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gasol {{signed with}} the San Antonio Spurs. On November 11, 2016, he had season highs with 21 points and six assists in a 96–86 win over the Detroit Pistons. On January 19, 2017, he was ruled out indefinitely after {{breaking}} his left ring finger during pregame warmups earlier that night. He underwent surgery the following day to repair a fracture of his left fourth <b>metacarpal.</b> On February 24, 2017, in a 105–97 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Gasol had 17 points and 11 rebounds off the bench in his return from a 15-game absence because of the finger injury. On April 12, 2017, Gasol scored 13 points to reach 20,000 career points in a 101–97 regular-season finale loss against the Utah Jazz, becoming the second European player to reach the mark after Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E

5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the <b>metacarpal</b> bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial <b>metacarpal</b> of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the second digit of the hand is the largest, even when the third digit is not present.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turner {{signed a}} four-year, $70 million {{contract}} with the Portland Trail Blazers. Turner battled Maurice Harkless for the starting small forward role through the preseason, {{but in the end}} he lost out. He debuted with a 3-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist performance in a 113–104 win over the Utah Jazz in 26 minutes off the bench. With Harkless injured on December 8, Turner started against the Memphis Grizzlies and notched a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double in a 8886 loss, despite a pair of go-ahead free throws by Turner with 27 seconds left. On January 5, 2017, he scored 15 of his season-high 20 points {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Trail Blazers' 118–109 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Turner's 11 assists off the bench on January 11 against the Cleveland Cavaliers was the most by a Portland reserve in nearly 3 years. On February 8, he was ruled out for approximately five to six weeks after sustaining a fracture of the third <b>metacarpal</b> in his right hand the night before playing against the Dallas Mavericks. He returned to action, wearing a protective brace, on March 18 after missing 14 games. The team was 77 without Turner. He opened the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double in a 12-point loss to the Golden State Warriors. The Trail Blazers were swept in four games, however.|$|E

5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third <b>metacarpal.</b> P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body.
