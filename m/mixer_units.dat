These include the survival under high mechanical stress such as vibration during the launch and extensive thermal cycling to cryogenic temperatures during the tests of the mixer unit and the instrument. An excellent (S 21 > - 0. 25 dB) IF signal transmission of the bias-T is achieved by special high reliability connections in the signal path. Different coefficients of thermal expansion are compensated by the mechanical flexibility of the connections. These special parts have been developed, manufactured, integrated and tested within this work in a three phase design cycle (Demonstration Model(DM) - Qualification Model (QM) - Flight Model (FM)). In addition to the high transmission, the bias-T provides filter circuits, which effectively protect the signal path from electromagnetic interference (EMI) entering the mixer unit via the unshielded bias lines. The <b>mixer</b> <b>units</b> have passed all performance and environmental tests and are presently integrated into the HIFI instrument. The second project is the development and fabrication of very broadband nonuniform couplers, which can be used as - 3 dB 90 °-hybrids on the IF side of sideband separating mixers with large IF bandwidth. By the smooth (e. g., nonuniform, not stepped-uniform) change of the even- and odd-mode impedances along the wave propagation direction, uncontrolled reflections are avoided, which is indispensable to achieve a large bandwidth. Strong power coupling (- 3 dB, e. g., 50 %) is achieved with broadside coupled lines in a homogeneous stripline configuration, which ensures TEM mode propagation. This TEM mode propagation and the smooth distribution of the electrical parameters allow to achieve a large bandwidth. The impedances can be calculated by Fourier transformation of the power coupling bandshape. In order to determine the actual geometry (e. g., stripline width and spacing) from even mode line impedances, a design procedure has been developed, which is presented in this thesis. It includes an appropriate mix of analytic calculations and an interpolation scheme which uses results from a commercial 2 D EM-field solver. This procedure has been successfully applied in order to design various couplers, which have been manufactured and tested. By introducing mode launchers {{in the vicinity of the}} coupler ports, the TEM mode purity could be improved, which led to an increased coupler bandwidth of 1. 9 - 9. 3 GHz...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new “twisted” 3 D {{microfluidic}} mixer fabricated by a laser writing/microfabrication technique. Effective and efficient mixing using the twisted micromixers {{can be obtained}} by combining two general chaotic mixing mechanisms: splitting/recombining and chaotic advection. The lamination of <b>mixer</b> <b>units</b> provides the splitting and recombination mechanism when the quadrant of circles is arranged in a two-layered serial arrangement of mixing units. The overall 3 D path of the microchannel introduces the advection. An experimental investigation using chemical solutions revealed that these novel 3 D passive microfluidic mixers were stable and could be operated at a wide range of flow rates. This micromixer finds application in the manipulation of tiny volumes of liquids that are crucial in diagnostics. The mixing performance was evaluated by dye visualization, and using a pH test that determined the chemical reaction of the solutions. A comparison of the tornado-mixer with this twisted micromixer was made to evaluate the efficiency of mixing. The efficiency of mixing was calculated within the channel by acquiring intensities using ImageJ software. Results suggested that efficient mixing can be obtained when more than 3 units were consecutively placed.

50|$|The pumps {{can drive}} {{low-pressure}} (10 to 30 bar, 1 to 3 MPa) or high-pressure (125 to 250 bar, 12.5 to 25.0 MPa) dispense systems. Mix heads can be simple static mix tubes, rotary element mixers, low-pressure dynamic mixers, or high-pressure hydraulically actuated direct impingement <b>mixers.</b> Control <b>units</b> may have basic on/off and dispense/stop switches, and analogue pressure and temperature gauges, {{or may be}} computer controlled with flow meters to electronically calibrate mix ratio, digital temperature and level sensors, and a full suite of statistical process control software. Add-ons to dispense equipment include nucleation or gas injection units, and third or fourth stream capability for adding pigments or metering in supplemental additive packages.|$|R
40|$|A {{completely}} integrated microreactor {{was developed}} {{that allows for}} the processing of very small amounts of chemical solutions. The entire system comprises several pumps and valves arranged in different branches {{as well as a}} mixing unit and a reaction chamber. The streaming path of each branch contains two valves and one pump each. The pumps are driven by piezoelectric elements mounted on thin glass membranes. Each pump is about 3. 5 mm x 3. 5 mm x 0. 7 mm. A pumping rate up to 25 microliters per hour can be achieved. The operational voltage ranges between 40 and 200 V. A volume stroke up to 1. 5 millimeter is achievable from the membrane structures. The valves are designed as passive valves. Sealing is by thin metal films. The dimension of a valve unit is 0. 8 x 0. 8. 07 mm. The ends of the separate streaming branches are arranged to meet in one point. This point acts as the beginning of a <b>mixer</b> <b>unit</b> which contains several fork-shaped channels. The arrangement of these channels allows for the division of the whole liquid stream into partial streams and their reuniting. A homogeneous mixing of solutions and/or gases can be observed after having passed about 10 of the fork elements. A reaction chamber is arranged behind the mixing unit to support the chemical reaction of special fluids. This unit contains heating elements placed outside of the chamber. The complete system is arranged in a modular structure and is built up of silicon. It comprises three silicon wafers bonded together by applying the silicon direct bonding technology. The silicon structures are made only by wet chemical etching processes. The fluid connections to the outside are realized using standard injection needles glued into v-shaped structures on the silicon wafers. It is possible to integrate other components, like sensors or electronic circuits using silicon as the basic material...|$|R
