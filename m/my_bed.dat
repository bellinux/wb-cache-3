25|$|Emin {{has often}} {{made use of}} found objects in her work from the early use of a {{cigarette}} box found {{in a car crash}} in which her uncle died. The most well known example is <b>My</b> <b>Bed,</b> where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E

The show displayed her unique appliquéd blankets, paintings, sculptures, films, neons, drawings and monoprints. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art was the only UK venue for the show which then went to the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo in Málaga, Spain and then to the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland from 2009.|$|E
500|$|I have {{demonstrated}} on myself in an injury occasioned by a fall, that it [...] {{did for me}} what surgeons could not do. Dr. Cushing of this city pronounced my injury incurable and that I could not survive three days because of it, when {{on the third day}} I rose from <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> and to the utter confusion of all I commenced my usual avocations and notwithstanding displacements, etc., I regained the natural position and functions of the body.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Flea {{revealed}} that he once again considered leaving the band whilst touring {{in support of the}} album, stating that [...] "throughout the By the Way tour I would play a show and then go and sit on the end of <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> staring into space." [...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E

6000|$|I said it with bitterness, for I felt {{outraged by}} this calm, cold talk over these heartless new engines of assassination. The doctor looked grieved, but not offended.

Let me be a Chaldean shepherd, and {{contemplate the}} stars. Let me be the careful watch who patrols the deck, and guards the ship from foes and wreck. Let me be anything but the companion of men who snore like the famous Furies in the old Greek play." [...] While I am venting my indignation, and collecting <b>my</b> <b>bedding,</b> the smiling and sleepy face of Mr. Migott disappears slowly {{from the side of}} the hammock--and before I am on deck, I hear the oily purr once more, just as amiable, soft, and regular as ever.|$|R
500|$|In 1999, two {{performance}} artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, {{jumped on}} Tracey Emin's installation <b>My</b> <b>Bed,</b> a work {{consisting of the}} artist's own unmade bed, at the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize, in an unauthorised art intervention. Chai had written, among other things, the words [...] "Anti Stuckism" [...] on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of The Guardian wrote (in 1999) that the event [...] "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement." [...] Writing in The Guardian ten years later, Jonathan Jones described the Stuckists as [...] "enemies of art", and what they say as [...] "cheap slogans" [...] and [...] "hysterical rants".|$|E
500|$|Charles Thomson's painting, Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision, as Charlotte Cripps of The Independent wrote {{is one of}} {{the best}} known {{paintings}} to come out of the Stuckist movement, and as Jane Morris wrote in The Guardian it's a likely [...] "signature piece" [...] for the movement, standing for its opposition to conceptual art. Painted in 2000, the piece has been exhibited in laterStuckist shows, and featured on placards in Stuckist demonstrations against the Turner Prize. It depicts Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery and the usual chairman of the Turner Prize jury, and satirises Young British Artist Tracey Emin's installation, <b>My</b> <b>Bed,</b> consisting of her bed and objects, including knickers, which she exhibited in 1999 as a Turner Prize nominee.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Mara in February 1959 {{unsettled}} Bell and he experienced {{a heart attack}} later that month. He converted to Catholicism {{in the summer of}} 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, [...] "I'd rather die watching football than in <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> with my boots off." [...] Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.|$|E

500|$|Several {{winners of}} the prize have won other notable awards such as the Venice Biennale, and {{continue}} to present their works at various international exhibitions. [...] Winners' reactions to the award range from Damien Hirst's [...] "A media circus {{to raise money for}} the Tate and Channel 4" [...] to Jeremy Deller's [...] "It blew me away, people's hunger to see what I'd done". Auction prices for works by previous winners have generally increased. [...] The award has also seen some unexpected results: [...] Tracey Emin's <b>My</b> <b>Bed,</b> was overlooked in 1999 despite drawing large crowds to the Tate. [...] The Chapman brothers and Willie Doherty lost out to Grayson Perry in 2003– Perry accepted the award dressed as a girl while Jake Chapman described [...] "losing the Turner prize to a grown man dressed as a small girl" [...] as his [...] "most embarrassing moment".|$|E

[...] The lyrics contain direct {{references}} to Christianity, with Fantasia singing: [...] "Thank you for never leaving me Lord Jesus!". She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. I made it. I {{made it through the}} storm." [...] She describes having a close relationship and faith in religion by singing: [...] "I got to say thank you Lord for keeping me, for grace and mercy. I thank you, because I made it!" [...] According to Devin Lazerine of Rap-Up, Fantasia [...] "triumphantly" [...] expresses the song's message through her vocals on lyrics such as [...] "I made it I made it, y’all! Still standing." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
60|$|A most {{beautiful}} summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast {{we went out}} arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion.

And because he came and went away so strangely--just as white-headed old men come {{sometimes}} to <b>my</b> <b>bed's</b> foot in the night, and say what I can't remember when the bright day returns. He told me he'd come back. I wonder why he broke his word!' ...|$|R

"After I had {{bundled in}} my things somehow I struck a match {{and had a}} {{dazzling}} glimpse of my berth; then I pitched the roll of <b>my</b> <b>bedding</b> into the bunk but took no trouble to spread it out.

500|$|In 1963, {{the comedy}} picture Who's Been Sleeping in <b>My</b> <b>Bed?,</b> {{starring}} Dean Martin, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jill St. John and Carol Burnett, {{was shot at}} the hotel. In the 1970s, John Lennon and Yoko Ono hid out {{in one of the}} bungalows for a week. Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and presidential aide John Ehrlichman were eating breakfast in the Polo Lounge when they were informed of the Watergate [...] in 1972. In January, 1976, Peter Finch died of a sudden heart attack while sitting in the hotel lobby. Two months later, he was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Howard Beale in the film Network. His co-star Faye Dunaway stayed at the hotel after winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the same film; in one memorable photograph she was seated by the hotel pool lounging back in a chair surrounded by newspapers and her Oscar trophy. The exterior of the hotel was featured on the album cover art of The Eagles's [...] LP [...] "Hotel California" [...] that same year. Two years later, [...] California Suite was filmed at the hotel.|$|E
500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
