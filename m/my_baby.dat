I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E

25|$|During the AKB48 Group Rinji Sokai {{concert in}} Nippon Budokan in April 2013, AKB48 {{announced}} {{her return to}} Team K and concurrent membership with SNH48. In the 2013 AKB48 general election, she finished tenth overall. During the election results event, she declared her plans to focus on SNH48, and after confirmation with AKB48 management, became the first AKB48 member to voluntarily drop concurrency. As a result, she {{did not participate in}} the rock-paper-scissors tournament in 2013 and rarely appeared with the group until February 2014, when AKB48 announced Miyazawa's transfer to Nagoya-based SKE48 at the Grand Reformation Festival, while staying a concurrent member of SNH48. She was appointed the 'leader' of SKE48's Team S. This time, she accepted the new position after learning of the transfer via a live phone call from that event. However, she suffered a significant decrease in popularity in the process, as she lost over 21000 votes compared to 2013 in the 2014 AKB48 general election, but still managed to maintain the 12th position overall. In SKE48, Miyazawa appeared frequently as one of the leading members in commercial campaigns, TV and stage performances, and had since then been selected to appear in AKB48's 38th single, her first regular single appearance since Sayonara Crawl, and her 29th title track performance overall. In the general election for the 41st single in 2015, she recovered from the heavy loss in 2014, by adding 31,000 votes to her result and ranking in at the 8th position, her personal best. Before the event, she stated that she would not be participating in future fan elections. By the end of 2015, she had appeared in 32 single A-sides of AKB48, trailing only five other members. Kuchibiru ni Be <b>My</b> <b>Baby,</b> AKB48's 10th anniversary single, marked her return to the main selection of promoting members of AKB48 releases. It was her first appearance in a management selected conventional line up of 16 members since Give Me Five! in 2012, before her transfer to SNH48.|$|E

500|$|In Cheek to Cheek, Gaga sings solo on [...] "Lush Life", [...] "Bang Bang (<b>My</b> <b>Baby</b> Shot Me Down)" [...] and [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", while Bennett's solo {{includes}} [...] "Don't Wait Too Long" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady". According to Gaga, [...] "Lush Life" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] complemented each other; for Bennett, the complement {{came from}} the fact that Duke Ellington wrote [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] and later collaborated with Strayhorn for [...] "Lush Life". Gaga sang [...] "Lush Life" [...] in her school choir, but it was only later she understood the lyrical interpretation of the track, about failure and heartache. While recording Cheek to Cheek she was emotionally upset about her professional and personal conflicts encountered during the Artpop era; Bennett had to support and guide her through the process. Newman recalled that [...] "Bang Bang (<b>My</b> <b>Baby</b> Shot Me Down)" [...] was recorded during the taping of the duo's show at Lincoln Center. Gaga had informed the musicians about performing the song, and piano player Alex Smith made the necessary musical arrangements the night before the concert. They did not rehearse it, and recorded it live when Gaga performed the song in front of the audience.|$|E

[...] Erin Strecker from Billboard reviewed Gaga's performance of [...] "Bang Bang (<b>My</b> <b>Baby</b> Shot Me Down)" [...] calling her rendition as [...] "incredible" [...] and saying that her [...] "version is all big notes and dramatic tension.
