50|$|Deciding {{whether a}} <b>mirror</b> <b>entry</b> is {{hazardous}} or non-hazardous by composition involves {{reference to the}} Approved Supply List (ASL) initially. If a substance is not listed in the ASL then the regulations {{permit the use of}} other sources such as Manufacturer's Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) to classify the waste. These documents contain Risk Phrases, which describe the hazards that the substance or substances present. Risk phrases have threshold values attached to them that indicate what concentration of a substance must be present in order for the waste to be classified as hazardous by the Hazard Code attached to the Risk Phrase.|$|E
50|$|Absolute {{hazardous}} {{entries are}} hazardous {{not due to}} {{the composition of the}} waste but by virtue of the process that produced it, {{the same is true for}} non-hazardous absolute <b>entries.</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>entries</b> can either be hazardous or non-hazardous depending on the composition of the waste.|$|R
50|$|Marian Engel's first {{published}} novel, No Clouds of Glory, {{was published in}} 1968.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in characterising waste is {{to decide on the}} {{appropriate}} EWC code. These codes carry three categories - absolute non-hazardous, <b>mirror</b> <b>entries</b> and absolute hazardous. Initial assessment for the majority of wastes follows a simple derivation of industry (some 20 main categories) from which they were originally obtained (Agricultural, wood working (furniture), Electronics, etc. [...] ). Each Derived section (denoted by the first 2 sets of 2 numbers refers to a particular industry or sector). The final set of 2 numbers relates directly to the waste. Where a waste is hazardous by its very composition, the EWC is followed by an Asterix).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For fixed m> 1, {{we study}} {{the product of}} m {{independent}} N ×N elliptic random matrices as N tends to infinity. Our main result shows that the empirical spectral distribution of the product converges, with probability 1, to the m-th power of the circular law, regardless of the joint distribution of the <b>mirror</b> <b>entries</b> in each matrix. This leads to {{a new kind of}} universality phenomenon: the limit law for the product of independent random matrices is independent of the limit laws for the individual matrices themselves. Our result also generalizes earlier results of Götze and Tikhomirov [17] and O’Rourke and Soshnikov [32] concerning the product of independent iid random matrices. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLegislation {{published}} in December 2014 revised both the List of Waste (LoW) and amended Appendix III of the revised Waste Framework Directive 2008 / 98 /EC; the latter redefined hazardous properties HP 1 to HP 13 and HP 15 but left {{the assessment of}} HP 14 unchanged to allow time for the Directorate General of the Environment of the European Commission to complete a study that is examining the impacts of four different calculation methods {{for the assessment of}} HP 14. This paper is a contribution to the assessment of the four calculation methods. It also includes the results of a fifth calculation method; referred to as " Method 2 with extended M-factors ". Two sets of data were utilised in the assessment; the first (Data Set # 1) comprised analytical data for 32 different waste streams (16 hazardous (H), 9 non-hazardous (NH) and 7 <b>mirror</b> <b>entries,</b> as classified by the LoW) while the second data set (Data Set # 2), supplied by the eco industries, comprised analytical data for 88 waste streams, all classified as hazardous (H) by the LoW. Two approaches were used to assess the five calculation methods. The first approach assessed the relative ranking of the five calculation methods by the frequency of their classification of waste streams as H. The relative ranking of the five methods (from most severe to less severe) is: Method 3 > Method 1 > Method 2 with extended M-factors > Method 2 > Method 4. This reflects the arithmetic ranking of the concentration limits of each method whe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study conveys {{striking}} {{findings regarding}} the operando structural {{behavior of the}} Na/FePO 4 system during a charge and discharge cycle. From Rietveld refinements of synchrotron operando X-Ray diffraction data, {{it appears that the}} active material presents large, non-stoichiometric domains while undergoing structural phase transformation. The corresponding extended limits of solubility are characterized by continuous variations in the metrics that <b>mirror</b> the <b>entry</b> of Na occupancy values into thermodynamically forbidden regions. A major consequence of this smoothed phase transformation is a significant decrease in the lattice volume mismatch, which could well compensate for the less efficient Na-based systems with respect to SEI and adverse effect of cation size in comparison to Li batteries. Comparison of the lattice volume mismatch on charge and discharge revealed an explanation for the asymmetry of the electrochemical curve...|$|R

In this paper, I discuss a public crowdsourcing of twentieth century conflict heritage in Finland, launched by state-owned broadcasting company Yleisradio. Here emphasis is on analysing the user behaviour and incentives, which can inform analogous future initiatives. Many of the public <b>entries</b> <b>mirror</b> local perspectives on conflict heritage: pride of personally important loci and self-satisfaction appear to be important incentives for taking part. Finally, I summarize themes that other heritage crowdsourcing organizers could apply to their work...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between modularity and entry mode choice {{in the context of}} business functions offshoring. We define the degree of modularity of an activity as technical architecture (whether it can be detached {{from the rest of the}} value chain without loss of synergies). We refer to the entry mode chosen as organizational architecture (whether a captive solution, a partnership or outsourcing). We propose that the selection of entry mode should reflect the alignment of the technical and organizational architectures: that is, they need to be ‘mirrored’. Modular activities are more likely to be outsourced, as modularity decreases transaction costs and knowledge leakages risks, while not-modular activities reflect captive entry modes. Based on the analysis of 486 business function offshoring initiatives, we also argue that firms can “break” the <b>mirror</b> as the <b>entry</b> choice is contingent upon the level of disintegration of the value chain and the offshoring experience of the firms...|$|R

5000|$|Located on 9th Street between Market Street and [...] "C" [...] Court. The {{rectangular}} {{theater is}} 120 ft along 9th Street and 90 ft on Market Street and [...] "C" [...] Court. The Ninth Street front presents a trapezoid appearance as the street rises a full {{story from the}} east corner on [...] "C" [...] Court to the west corner on Market Street. Originally, three storefronts were located along 9th street with doors on the incline.The walls are patterned, buff-toned stucco with a muted backdrop for the classical decorative features. The decorative features are glazed, white terra cotta and applied around the main entrance. The roof above the auditorium is gabled and flat, abutting the parapets. It is brick and hollow clay tile construction with a steel truss roof system over the auditorium. Reinforced concrete beams support the proscenium arch and balcony.The main entrance is rounded at the northeast corner and sheathed in the terra cotta. The classical decorative features are concentrated around the entrance. Three arched openings form a semi-circular arcaded entry with a ticket window, a double leaf glass door, and terrazzo flooring and marble kickplating. A replicated three-part flower petal marquee projects out over the entranceway. The second story is enclosed and capped with decorative parapet with lighted finials. The fenestration on the upper facade of the turret-like corner <b>mirrors</b> the arcaded <b>entry</b> below and features three sets of segmented arch windows. The remainder of the primary facade is less ornamented. The stuccoed wall surface is divided into six bays along the length by terra cotta piers of classical design. The decorative terra cotta parapet extends the entire length with lighted finials where the piers abut the cornice line. Adjacent to the main entry, the upper story {{of the first three}} bays features fenestration and an ornamented cornice. Lighted finials smaller than the pier finials adorn the parapet. Storefronts occupied the first bays along the second level from the northwest corner. [...] The Market Street front has a replicated storefront on the corner and a stairwell from an emergency exit serving the auditorium below.|$|R
