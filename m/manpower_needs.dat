5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on <b>manpower</b> <b>needs,</b> but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA {{to focus}} better on its main role of {{recruiting}} for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections {{to deal with}} recruiting {{inside and outside the}} Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the SS-Führungshauptamt (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) SS-Brigadeführer Hans Jüttner on Hitler's expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would fall short of its <b>manpower</b> <b>needs</b> by at least 6,000 per year.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{began the}} World War with 35 pilots and 51 student pilots on its rosters. Like {{the rest of}} the Army, the Aviation Section {{concluded}} that training Reserve officers was the solution to its <b>manpower</b> <b>needs</b> and sent a panel of three representatives from each of six U.S. universities to Toronto from 7 to 11 May 1917 to study Canada's pilot training program. The Chief Signal Officer assigned Major Hiram Bingham III, an adventurer and reserve officer on the faculty of Yale, to organize a training program on the Canadian model. A three-phase Flying Cadet program came into being, and although systematic, pressing needs for manpower saw many overlaps of the phases.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Malaya's {{independence}} from the British in 1957, the population included many first or second-generation immigrants {{who had come to}} fill colonial <b>manpower</b> <b>needs</b> as indentured labourers. Chinese legal immigrants, who typically settled in urban areas, {{played a significant role in}} the commercial sector after the Indians left the country to return to India, many of the commercial sectors were sold to the Chinese immigrants. The Communities Liaison Committee (CLC), comprising leading politicians from different racial backgrounds, supported the promotion of economic equality for the Malays, conditional on political equality for the non-Malays. CLC member E.E.C. Thuraisingham later said, [...] "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals." [...] The massive demographic change happened to all British colonised countries of which these countries become multi religion and multiracial while Britain itself remain homogenous. The natives of British colonised countries such as Malaysia, South Africa, Fiji, Singapore, Uganda, Guyana, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago become minorities and discriminated against employment and education for 200 years. British workers (Chinese and Indians) on the other hand not only were encouraged to migrate to the colonised countries, they were also given business opportunities instead of to the natives. Thus affirmative action was implemented in British colonised countries using models of affirmative actions for the natives in Canada, USA, New Zealand and Australia. Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore and Guyana today are still ruled by British migrants (Chinese and Indians) and there are accusations that the natives of the countries are [...] still discriminated against in employment and education.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the late}} Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from {{a rural area}} (an adsiduus) who served for {{particular}} (often annual) campaigns, and who supplied his own equipment and, {{in the case of}} equites, his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200 BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies. After 200 BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as <b>manpower</b> <b>needs</b> increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with Gaius Marius in 107 BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (proletarii) were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long—up to twenty years if emergencies required it although Brunt argues that six or seven years was more typical. Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid stipendium (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously [...] "doubled" [...] payments to his troops to 225 denarii a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement. Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the auxilia) were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul. By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries were paid 900 sesterces a year and could expect a payment of 12,000 sesterces on retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the final}} report welcomed the {{expansion}} of higher education, correcting the prior situation of unequal and limited access, the World Bank did not favour further expansion: [...] "...the enrolment represents 8% of the 18–22 age group and could be considered adequate. ...In view of the rapidly increased university enrolments, which represent an uneconomical drain in the economy... gradual introduction of quantitative restraints" [...] (World Bank, 1977 Progress report). At the same time, the World Bank urged the Portuguese authorities to restrain enrolment quotas {{so as to make}} [...] "better use" [...] and rationalise the supply of higher education and improve the management of the system, namely in terms of accountability, coordination, and efficiency. Future expansions should be planned, taking into account <b>manpower</b> <b>needs,</b> and demographic and enrolment trends. Subsequently, the World Bank produced two [...] "Staff Appraisal Reports", which provided insights about the negotiations between the Bank's Mission and the Portuguese government, and further confirmed the Bank's priorities. In the first Report of Assessment (No. 1807-PO, 1978), the Bank insisted on three criteria: balancing the supply of higher education graduates with the economic needs of the country, developing a persistent and consistent policy towards vocational education, and upgrading teacher training programs. The Bank suggested that Portugal needed not only to train high level technicians but also middle level personnel (on a yearly basis: 1400 technicians with short cycle post-secondary education, 500 agricultural technicians and 6000 middle level managers). Subsequently, the government passed Decree-Law 397/77 of 17 September, which established a numerus clausus for every university study programme and eliminated the threat to the new short vocational education programs – that without reducing the supply of engineering jobs, graduates of the technician training institutes would find employment too scarce. The World Bank was critical of the erratic policies toward the existing technical institutes, and of the excessive enrolment in university engineering programs and the lax approach on managing vacancy quotas, and raised the issue of diseconomies of scale in the system, suggesting that there were too many institutions with small dimensions. The government replied to the Bank’s demands with Decree-Law 513-T/79, which established a network of polytechnic institutes, including Higher Schools of Education. The main objectives of Polytechnic education were: to provide education with an applied and technical emphasis and strong vocational orientation, and for training intermediate-level technicians for industries, service companies and educational units (first cycle of basic education).|$|E
