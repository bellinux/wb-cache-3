The <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> began the night of 8 November. Coalition forces attacked from the north, achieving complete tactical surprise.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{also participated}} in the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March. This time a 6-inch (152mm) {{howitzer}} battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes; five of the howitzer shells hit her armour and did no damage, but the seven that hit outside her armour protection did considerable structural damage and temporarily put one of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} attempt, a Sa'iqa company from the 103rd Battalion would occupy {{positions}} four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate the fort. It would be supported by an AT-3 Sagger ATGM platoon. The <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> would be launched from the east by a Sa'iqa company and a company from al-Mezahi's battalion as the first echelon. Other units of al-Mezahi's battalion would conduct a secondary attack from the west, while one company remained in reserve near Port Fouad along with a Sa'iqa company. A reinforced company (less one platoon) of al-Mezahi's battalion would land by sea directly upon the Israeli fort. The attack would be preceded by a 30-minute-long fire preparation.|$|E

5|$|As the VRS Herzegovina Corps {{positions}} around Tasovčići collapsed, the attacking {{forces were}} able to quickly move east along its planned line of advance. On 11 June, the Mostar HVO forces attacked VRS positions {{on the west bank}} of the Neretva River, south of the city of Mostar in support of the <b>main</b> <b>attack.</b> The advance was immediately successful, capturing the villages of Varda, Kruševo, Jasenica, Slipčići and the Orlovac Mountain. The HVO captured JNA/VRS Heliport Barracks in Mostar the same day. On 12 June, the HVO pushed all remaining VRS forces east across the river.|$|E
5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

5|$|Model's <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> was {{delivered}} by XLVII Panzer Corps, supported by 45 Tigers of the attached 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps, with an attached regiment of 83 Ferdinand tank destroyers. On the right flank, XLVI Panzer Corps consisted {{at this time}} of four infantry divisions with just 9 tanks and 31 assault guns. To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps, which consisted of the reinforced 78th Assault Infantry Division and two regular infantry divisions. While the corps contained no tanks, it did have 62 assault guns. Opposing the 9th Army was the Central Front, deployed in three heavily fortified defensive belts.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. By that time, the BEF {{consisted}} of 10 infantry divisions in three corps, a tank brigade and a Royal Air Force detachment of around 500 aircraft. The BEF was pinned by a German diversionary attack through Belgium and then isolated by the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> {{that came through}} the Ardennes forest. Well-equipped and highly mobile Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht overran the French and then British prepared defences. There was some fierce fighting, however being dwarfed by the German land forces most of the BEF withdrew to a small area around the French port of Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the <b>main</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{final phase}} of Zeppelin was codenamed Turpitude, the story for which was an {{overland}} invasion of Greece by British troops via Turkey and the Soviet Union via Bulgaria. It was planned in the most part by 'A' Force's Michael Crichton in Cairo. Deception efforts for Turpitude were focused in Syria, and around the ports of Tripoli and Lattakia. The Allies hoped to indicate a spoiling attack against the island of Rhodes before the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> against Salonika. Turpitude finished on 26 June and Zeppelin officially {{came to a close}} on 6 July 1944.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> {{across the}} Sangro by V Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey), {{comprising}} the British 78th Infantry Division (Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh) and 8th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Dudley Russell) with supporting and diversionary attacks further inland by the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg) and XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) was delayed by bad weather until late November. After {{several days of}} hard fighting, the Germans withdrew to the defences they had prepared on the high ground {{to the north of}} the Moro river.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>attack,</b> {{from the}} north and east, was to be made by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, which moved in line of troop columns. The New Zealanders were supported by a machine gun squadron armed with Vickers and Lewis guns, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade all under the command of Chaytor. This attack began near the village of Magdhaba and the Wadi El Arish, on the virtually featureless battleground, when the British Empire artillery opened fire {{at the same time as}} Chaytor's group moved towards the Ottoman garrison's right and rear.|$|E

At daybreak, Hill 317 was re-occupied by Belgian troops, and a reconnaissance patrol from C Company came under machine gun and mortar fire from Palli-Bong hill.|$|R
50|$|Eventually all 12 Chinese {{divisions}} of the 9th Corps Army were deployed. Eight {{divisions of}} the PVA 20th and 27th Corps served as the <b>main</b> <b>attacking</b> force. Four {{divisions of the}} PVA 26th Corps initially were held back in reserve, and deployed after 20th and 27th Corps exhausted all available strength.|$|R
5|$|The second phase, {{scheduled}} to begin on 23 August, was to capture Bapaume and then advance further east to Reincourt-les-Bapaume and Bancourt-Fremicourt and the high ground beyond. The New Zealanders were to play a key role; the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades of the New Zealand Division, kept in reserve, were {{to be ready to}} exploit any breakthrough on the front. To distract the Germans from the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> being carried out by the Third Army, the French Tenth Army conducted diversionary attacks to the south.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> to make progress before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then {{to take away from}} it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E

5000|$|The English, {{with their}} Dutch allies, {{attacked}} the fortress again in 1695. Though the fort was unfinished, ten guns had been installed, which permitted the French to repulse the attack.

5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{accompanied}} the First Corps to northern Georgia {{in the fall}} of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle, but served as Longstreet's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He returned with the corps to Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able to move his guns quickly through the lines, emplacing them to repel the <b>main</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although III./JG 53 failed, the <b>main</b> <b>attack</b> was {{a success}} by comparison. Stab,. II. and IV./JG 53 {{encountered}} no difficulties on the outward leg. The Germans caused significant damage among the parked USAAF fighters on the field. When the attack against the Metz airfield was over, the three JG 53 Gruppen reported the loss of 20 Bf 109s and seven damaged. This represented more than 50 percent of the attacking 52 fighters. Some 13 pilots were missing; three were killed, six remain missing as of today, and four were captured. A further three were wounded. JG 53 claimed 27 USAAF fighters {{on the ground and}} eight damaged. Added to this total is four aerial victories. In total JG 53 lost 30 Bf 109s and eight damaged in the two operations. This was a total loss of 48%. The losses of the USAAF were 22 destroyed, 11 damaged (all P-47ts).|$|E
25|$|Following Tarawa, the {{regiment}} {{participated in the}} Battle of Saipan and the Battle of Tinian in 1944.
