5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a little boy mysteriously reappears after having been kidnapped for ten years. However, he has not aged one bit after his disappearance. While the case stirs up painful <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> Doggett, suspicion stirs that the boy is not all he seems.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated separation between systems supporting <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> appearance and <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> location. However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by a confound occurring because of the simultaneous presentation of objects in multiple-item arrays when assessing <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> appearance and the sequential presentation of items when assessing <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> location. This paper reports an experiment in which sequential or simultaneous modes of presentation were factorially manipulated with <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> visual appearance or <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> location. Spatial interference (tapping) or visual interference (dynamic visual noise) were presented during retention. Appearance versus location interacted {{with the type of}} interference task, but mode of presentation did not. These results are consistent with the view that different subsystems within visuo-spatial working <b>memory</b> support <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> appearance and <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> location. © 2008 The Experimental Psychology Society...|$|R
40|$|Remembering {{the order}} in which a {{sequence}} of events occurred can be an invaluable function of memory. Although important, the quality of <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order information {{has been shown to be}} significantly affected by the way in which the information was encoded. That is, some encoding conditions lead to better <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order than others. This dissertation presents a systematic examination of the features of encoding tasks that disrupt <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order. Chapter I examines the effects of semantic versus non-semantic processing, item-specific versus item-generic processing, and item-specific versus relational processing on <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order, revealing that any type of response-required task disrupts <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order, unless that task is relational in nature. Chapter II examines the role of processing time in the disruption of <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order and demonstrates that preserving response-free study time benefits <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order, suggesting that response tasks disrupt <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order because they take time away from the encoding of relational information. Chapter III introduces a novel procedure <b>for</b> examining <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order—an order recognition task—which provides a new method <b>for</b> testing relational <b>memory,</b> allowing <b>for</b> conceptual replications and enhancing the generalizability of findings surrounding encoding tasks and <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order. Taken together, the experiments in this dissertation demonstrate that poor <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> order is the direct result of reduced time for processing inter-item relations...|$|R

During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned {{biochemist}} David Robert Jones is {{visited by}} his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones {{that the job}} in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E
40|$|Showing an arousing central {{stimulus}} {{in a scene}} {{often leads}} to enhanced <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the arousing central information and impaired <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> peripheral details. However, {{it is not clear}} from previous work whether arousing stimuli impair <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> all non-arousing nearby information or just background information. In several experiments, we tested how emotionally arousing pictures affect <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> nearby pictures and for background information. We found that when two pictures were presented together, having one of the pictures be arousing did not affect item and location <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the other picture. In contrast, an arousing picture impaired <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> a background pattern. These findings suggest that arousal impairs <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> information that is the target of perceptual suppression, such as background information when there is a figure-ground distinction, but does not impair <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> other foreground information. 3 The limits of arousal’s impairing effects on nearby information Arousing stimuli often create memory trade-offs, in which memory is enhance...|$|R

However, a metaphorical task at study had opposite effects on the long-term <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> pictures and words, producing better <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> words and poorer <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> pictures compared to a literal decision task at study.

40|$|Working memory mediates the {{short-term}} maintenance of information. Virtually all empirical research on working memory involves investigations of working <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> verbal and visual information. Whereas aging is {{typically associated with}} a deficit in working <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> these types of information, recent findings suggestive of relatively well-preserved long-term <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> emotional information in older adults raise questions about working <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> emotional material. This study examined age differences in working <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> emotional versus visual information. Findings demonstrate that, despite an age-related deficit for the latter, working <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> emotion was unimpaired. Further, older adults exhibited superior performance on positive relative to negative emotion trials, whereas their younger counterparts exhibited the opposite pattern...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to its effects during the encoding phase, emotional arousal appears to {{increase the likelihood of}} memory consolidation during the retention (storage) stage of memory (the process of creating a permanent record of the encoded information). A number of studies show that over time, <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> neutral stimuli decrease but <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> arousing stimuli remain the same or improve.|$|E

40|$|Odor {{memory has}} been argued to exhibit unique {{characteristics}} in relation to <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> other types of stimuli such as visually presented words. Two experiments investigated episodic recognition performance as well as <b>memory</b> awareness <b>for</b> odors and words across manipulations of orienting task and retention interval. Orienting task mattered little to odor recognition. However, in contradiction with several previous studies, substantial forgetting of odors was found. After controlling for effects of odor identifiability, {{it was found that}} <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> identified odors exhibited greater similarities to <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> words than to <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> unidentified odors...|$|R
40|$|A {{flashbulb}} memory (FM) is a vivid, enduring <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> how one {{learned about}} a surprising, shocking event. It thus involves <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> {{the source of}} event information, as opposed to <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the event itself. Which brain regions are involved in FM, however, is uncertain. Although medial temporal lobe/diencephalic (MTL/D) damage impairs content or item memory, frontal lobe (FL) damage {{has been associated with}} impaired source memory. One would therefore expect that FM should depend on the FLs, although two recent reports do not support this idea. In the current study, we examined <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the events of September 11 th, and <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the source of that information, in MTL/D patients, FL patients, and healthy subjects. Only the MTL/D patients were impaired in long-term <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the event itself, measured after a 6 month retention interval. The FL patients, on the other hand, showed a selective deficit in source memory, although their <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> the target event was unimpaired. MTL/D and FL structures appear to play different roles in <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> flashbulb events. People often report vivid, long-lasting recollections of the circumstances in which the...|$|R

25|$|Others have {{discovered}} that memory enhancements for emotional information tend to be greater after longer delays than after relatively short ones.

40|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>for</b> rhythmic tone {{sequence}} {{plays an}} important roll in rhythm perce ption and variety of study has been made on it.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we found source <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> perceptual features {{to differentiate between}} younger but not older adults’ reports of recollective (“remember”; R) and “know” (K) experiences. In two experiments with younger (17 – 30 years) and older (64 – 81 years) participants, we examined whether <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> meaningful speaker sources would accompany older adults’ recollective experience. Indeed, <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> male and female speakers (but not partial <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> gender; Experiment 1) as well as bound <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> speakers and their facial expressions (Experiment 2) distinguished between both younger and older adults’ RK reports. Thus, <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> some sources forms a common basis for younger and older adults’ retrieval experience.

25|$|Researchers do {{not agree}} about how long episodic {{memories}} are stored in the hippocampus. Some researchers believe that episodic memories always rely on the hippocampus.

Visual interference tasks reduced significantly <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> sound location but not for sound content.

50|$|The {{processes}} {{involved in}} this enhancement may be distinct from those mediating the enhanced <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> arousing items. It {{has been suggested that}} in contrast to the relatively automatic attentional modulation of <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> arousing information, <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> non-arousing positive or negative stimuli may benefit instead from conscious encoding strategies, such as elaboration. This elaborative processing can be autobiographical or semantic.|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{influences}} on memory {{can lead to}} trade-offs in <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> gist or detail and trade-offs in <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> central or peripheral aspects of an event. Attentional narrowing has often been proposed as a theoretical explanation for this pattern of findings with negative emotion. These trade-offs have been less extensively investigated with positive emotion. In three experiments, we investigate <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> specific visual details {{of positive and negative}} stimuli, examine central-peripheral trade-offs in memory and assess the hypothesis that attentional narrowing contributes to emotional enhancement of memory specificity. We found <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> details was enhanced by negative and positive emotion. Central-peripheral trade-offs were found in <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> negative emotional stimuli but not in <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> positive emotional stimuli. These trade-offs with negative emotion were associated with attentional narrowing at the time of encoding, as measured by eye movements. There were no attentional effects at the time of encoding found with positive emotional stimuli.

25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our <b>memories</b> <b>for</b> further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that <b>memory</b> is {{enhanced}} <b>for</b> emotionally negative and positive information relative to neutral information. We examined whether emotion-induced memory enhancement is influenced by low-level perceptual attributes such as color. Because in everyday life red is often used as a warning signal, whereas green signals security, we hypothesized that red might enhance <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> negative information and green <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> positive information. To capture the signaling function of colors, we measured <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> words standing out from the context by color, and manipulated the color and emotional significance of the outstanding words. Making words outstanding by color strongly enhanced memory, replicating the well-known von Restorff effect. Furthermore, <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> colored words was further increased by emotional significance, replicating the memory-enhancing effect of emotion. Most intriguingly, the effects of emotion on memory additionally depended on color type. Red strongly increased <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> negative words, whereas green strongly increased <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> positive words. These findings provide the first evidence that emotion-induced memory enhancement is influenced by color and demonstrate that different colors can have different functions in human memory...|$|R
