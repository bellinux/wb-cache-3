40|$|Vibration {{problems}} during metal cutting occur {{frequently in the}} manufacturing industry. The vibration level depends on many different parameters such as the material type, {{the dimensions of the}} workpiece, the rigidity of tooling structure, the cutting data, and the operation mode. In milling, the cutting process subjects the tool to vibrations, and having a <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> with a long overhang will most likely result in high vibration levels. As a consequence of these vibrations, the tool life is reduced, the surface finishing becomes poor, and disturbing sound appears. In this report, an investigation of the dynamic properties of a <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> with moderate overhang has been carried out by means of experimental modal analysis and vibration analysis during the operating mode. Both the angular vibrations of the rotating tool and the vibrations of the machine tool structure were examined during milling. Also, vibration of the workpiece and the milling machine was examined during cutting. This re- port focuses on identifying the source/sources of the dominant milling vibration components and on determining which of these vibrations that are related to the structural dynamic properties of the <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{transmitter}} {{system has been}} developed to collect high bandwidth data from torque and temperature sensor integrated cutting tools. The system is useful for collecting high resolution end milling torque and tool temperature during cutting without interfering with the cutting process. To achieve this, a Bluetooth transmitter and data conditioning sys-tem has been designed and integrated into an end <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder.</b> The wireless unit transmits a signal from a dual sensor-amplifier system. The system is designed to power and sample a variety of dynamic sensors including accelerometers, strain gages, and thermocouples. The tool holder can simultaneously sample two sensors from a sensor integrated end milling tool. These sensors reside inside of the endmill tooling and inter-face via an electrical connector within the tool holder. The compliance of the tool and tool holder are unaffected by the sensing system. A tool integrated with a torque sensor and thermocouple is demonstrated. The system is calibrated and cutting torque and tool temperature signals are observed. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} specific cutting energy measurements as {{a function}} of the cutting speed and tool cutting edge geometry. The experimental work was carried out on a vertical CNC machining center with 7, 500 rpm spindle rotation and 7. 5 kW power. Hardened steels ASTM H 13 (50 HRC) were machined at conventional cutting speed and high-speed cutting (HSC). TiN coated carbides with seven different geometries of chip breaker were applied on dry tests. A special <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> with only one cutting edge was developed and the machining forces needed to calculate the specific cutting energy were recorded using a piezoelectric 4 -component dynamometer. Workpiece roughness and chip formation process were also evaluated. The results showed that the specific cutting energy decreased 15. 5 % when cutting speed was increased up to 700 %. An increase of 1 ° in tool chip breaker chamfer angle lead to a reduction in the specific cutting energy about 13. 7 % and 28. 6 % when machining at HSC and conventional cutting speed respectively. Furthermore the workpiece roughness values evaluated in all test conditions were very low, closer to those of typical grinding operations (~ 0. 20 µm). Probable adiabatic shear occurred on chip segmentation at HSC...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{in metal}} cutting {{is a common}} problem in the {{manufacturing}} industry, especially when long and slender tool holders or boring bars {{are involved in the}} manufacturing process. Vibration has a detrimental effect on machining. In particular the surface finish is likely to suffer, but tool life is also most likely to be reduced. Tool vibration also results in loud noise that may disturb the working environment. The first part of this thesis describes the development of a robust and manually adjustable analog controller capable of actively controlling boring bar vibrations related to internal turning. This controller is compared with an adaptive digital feedback filtered-x LMS controller and it displays similar performance with a vibration attenuation of up to 50 dB. A thorough experimental investigation of the influence of the clamping properties on the dynamic properties of clamped boring bars is also carried out in second part of the thesis. In relation to this, it is demonstrated that the number of clamping screws, the clamping screw diameter size, the screw tightening torque and the order the screws are tightened, have a significant influence on a clamped boring bar’s eigenfrequencies as well as on its mode shape orientation in the cutting speed - cutting depth plane. Also, an initial investigation of nonlinear dynamic properties of clamped boring bars was carried out. Furthermore, vibration in milling has also been studied in relation to millingtool holders with a long overhang. A basic investigation concerning the spatial dynamic properties of the tool holders of milling machines, both when not cutting and during cutting, has been carried out. Also, active control of <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> vibration has been investigated and a first prototype of an active <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> was implemented and tested. The challenge of transferring electrical power while maintaining good signal quality to and from a rotating object is addressed and a solution to this is proposed. Finally, vibration is also a problem for the hydroelectric power industry. In Sweden, hydroelectric power plants stand for approximately half of Sweden’s electrical power production and are also considered to be a so-called green source of energy. When renovating water turbines in small-scale hydroelectric power plants and modifying them to optimize efficiency, it is not uncommon that disturbing vibrations occur in the power plant. These vibrations have a negative influence on the production capacity and will wear various components quickly. Occasionally, these vibrations may cause severe damage to the power plant. To identify this vibration problem, experimental modal analysis and operating deflection shape analysis were utilized. To reduce the vibration problem, active control using inertial mass actuators was investigated. Preliminary results indicate a significant attenuation of the vibrations...|$|E

500|$|Rotary {{broaching}} requires two tooling {{components: a}} <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and a broach. The leading (cutting) {{edge of the}} broach has a contour matching the desired final shape. The broach is mounted in a special <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> that allows it to freely rotate. The <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1°.

40|$|In {{the turning}} {{operation}} chatter or vibration {{is a frequent}} problem, which affects {{the result of the}} machining, and, in particular, the surface finish. Tool life is also influenced by vibration. Severe acoustic noise in the working environment frequently occurs as a result of dynamic motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. These problems can be reduced by active control of machine-tool vibration based on high magnetostrictive actuators. However, both the physical features and properties of a active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction based on high magnetostrictive actuators and the fact that this type of actuators generally have a non-linear behaviour highly reduce its applicability to the general lathe and turning operation. Therefor, a new generation embedded active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators have been developed. Based on spectrum estimates, both coherence spectrum and frequency response function estimates has been calculated for both the old <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction and the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank. From the results it follows that the phase delay is smaller and the linearity of the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank are superior compared to the old technology.

40|$|Cutting {{force is}} one of the main factors to be {{considered}} in CNC milling machine. Prediction models and optimum values are very important for the machinist to save number of cutting tools and reduce machining time. This paper discussed the effect of the two different angles (90 ° and 70 °) of <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> on cutting force when machining aerospace material (Hastelloy C- 22 HS) in two different environments (dry and flood). The 90 o <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is suitable to be used in rough machining, milling casting part, internal facing with low accuracy and others. It can be used in the condition of high cutting speed, high feed rate and high axial depth. On the other hand, the 70 o <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is more suitable for milling operation of final machining component, hard material, etc. Response surface method (RSM) was used to minimize the number of experiments. First order models were developed to optimize the machining parameters (cutting speed, federate and axial depth) and obtain the optimum cutting force. It observed that low value cutting parameters need to be used for 70 ° <b>tool</b> <b>holders,</b> meanwhile for 90 ° <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> high value cutting parameters can be used.

The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) {{diamond and}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are deposited on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tools respectively using the hot filament {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HFCVD) technique and the vacuum arc discharge with a graphite cathode.
