5|$|Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! is {{the debut}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth {{released}} on June 12, 1985 {{by the independent}} record label Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. After spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol and food, the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album themselves. Despite the resulting poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! played {{an essential role in}} establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, violence, and occultism.|$|E

5|$|A European {{tour with}} AC/DC {{in support of}} The World Needs a Hero began in mid-2001, {{followed}} by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening. That year, Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.|$|E

5|$|Megadeth {{began with}} live {{performances}} before the record was released. Although {{not a member}} of the band, Kerry King of Slayer played lead guitar for a short period because Mustaine had not recruited a full-time guitarist yet. In mid-1985, the group toured the United States and Canada for the first time, supporting Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> with Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by touring guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up to the recording of the next album.|$|E
5|$|American thrash metal band Megadeth has {{released}} fifteen studio albums, five live albums, six compilation albums, one EP, forty-seven singles, ten video albums, and thirty-six music videos. After {{he was fired}} from Metallica in 1983, guitarist and vocalist Dave Mustaine formed Megadeth along with bassist Dave Ellefson, guitarist Greg Handevidt, and drummer Dijon Carruthers. The band toured and gained a following, signing with the independent label Combat Records in late 1984. Megadeth's debut album Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! (1985), sold very well for an independent release, and the group {{attracted the attention of}} major record labels. By the end of the year, the group signed with Capitol Records. Megadeth's first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is an American thrash metal band {{formed by}} guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine—after he {{departed}} from Metallica—along with bassist David Ellefson, guitarist Greg Handevidt, and drummer Dijon Carruthers, in 1983. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a demo that featured new drummer Lee Rausch, who replaced Carruthers. Slayer guitarist Kerry King covered live dates while a permanent replacement was sought. This lineup was short-lived {{and after a}} few shows in 1984, Lee Rausch was replaced by jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson, in addition to the second guitarist Chris Poland. During the Megadeth's 1985 tour promoting their debut, Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good!, Poland left the band and was temporarily replaced by Mike Albert. Poland then rejoined Megadeth in October of the same year, shortly before they began work on Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?. After years of problems stemming from substance abuse, Mustaine fired both Poland and Samuelson before recording the third album So Far, So Good... So What!; being replaced by Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{popularity}} of thrash metal increased in 1984 {{with the release}} of Metallica's sophomore record Ride the Lightning, as well as Anthrax's debut Fistful of Metal. Overkill and Slayer released extended plays on independent labels the same year. This led to a heavier sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus' Bonded by Blood and Slayer's Hell Awaits. In 1985, the German band Kreator released their debut album Endless Pain and the Brazilian band Sepultura released their EP Bestial Devastation. Megadeth, which was formed by former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine, released their debut album Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good!, and Anthrax released the critically acclaimed Spreading the Disease in 1985.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Combat Records {{gave the}} band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album. After {{spending}} $4,000 {{of the budget}} on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves. Despite its low fidelity sound, Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! was relatively successful in underground metal circles on its release that summer and attracted major-label interest. Music writer Joel McIver praised its [...] "blistering technicality" [...] and stated that the album [...] "raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully". The front cover marked the debut of band mascot Vic Rattlehead, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.|$|E
500|$|Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! {{features}} [...] "Mechanix," [...] a song Mustaine wrote {{during his}} time with Metallica. Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal {{not to use the}} music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song entitled [...] "The Four Horsemen", with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section. The album also included a cover of Nancy Sinatra's [...] "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'," [...] at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics. Megadeth's version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer, Lee Hazlewood, called Mustaine's changes [...] "vile and offensive". Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.|$|E
500|$|Killing Is <b>My</b> <b>Business...</b> and Business Is Good! {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{not just}} from metal-oriented magazines, but from the mainstream press too. Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, called the album a [...] "ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal", weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is [...] "as raw as Megadeth gets". However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren't completely developed, and called Mustaine's vocals [...] "amateurish at best". Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still [...] "finding their way" [...] on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship.|$|E
