Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E.

She won the election with 72.2% of the vote, the largest victory <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> a statewide candidate in New York history, better than Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004.

5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination– and eventually, the presidency– went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E

Hassett's bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 196 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 51 runs. In the following match against Essex, Bradman returned and Hassett was rested as Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring a world-record of 721 first-class runs in one day. The visitors then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> the summer.

5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> the summer. On the first day, Australia set {{a world record}} by scoring 721, the most first-class runs made in a single day's play, but Ring was unable {{to contribute to the}} surfeit of scoring, making only one. He bowled 18 overs and conceded a total of 35 runs without success as the hosts were bowled out for 83 and 187. This was followed by another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. After having failed to score more than two runs in any of his first three innings of the tour, Ring came to the wicket at 7/317 and scored 53, adding 87 runs in partnership with fellow Victorian Sam Loxton before being bowled. After Australia were out for 431, Ring took a match total of 1/51, removing Geoffrey Keighley as the hosts made 185 and 156.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> the summer. On the first day, Australia set {{a world record}} by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, all rounder Keith Miller came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a golden duck. Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with Sam Loxton. The partnership took only an hour, and Australia {{went on to win}} by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack of opportunities given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen. Batting at No. 5 in the next match against Oxford University, Hamence made only three as Australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory.|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} robustness {{of stable}} feedback loops designed {{on the basis}} of multirate-output controllers (MROCs) is analysed in this paper. For MROC-based feedback loops, designed to achieve stabilization through pole placement or deterministic linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal regulation, we characterize additive or multiplicative norm-bounded perturbations of the loop transfer-function matrix that do not destabilize the closed-loop system. New sufficient stability conditions in terms of the elementary MROC matrices are presented, for both static and (stable) dynamic MROCs. Moreover, lower bounds for the minimum singular values of the return-difference and of the inverse return-difference matrices are suggested for all cases of the aforementioned MROC-based stable feedback designs. Also suggested are guaranteed stability <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> MROC-based pole placers and LQ optimal regulators. A comparison between the suggested stability <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> static and (stable) dynamic MROCs is presented, while the superiority of these margins over known stability <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> deterministic LQ optimal regulators is identified. Finally, an analysis of the deficiency of the aforementioned stablity <b>margins</b> is presented <b>for</b> cases where the MROC feedback gains become very large, and useful guidelines are suggested for the choice of the sampling period and of the output multiplicities of the sampling to avoid this deficiency...|$|R
