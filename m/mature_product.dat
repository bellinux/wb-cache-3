2500|$|In {{molecular}} biology miR-181 microRNA precursor {{is a small}} non-coding RNA molecule. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the RNase-III type enzyme Dicer to give a ~22 nucleotide <b>mature</b> <b>product.</b> In this case the mature sequence comes from the 5' arm of the precursor.

50|$|The mir-6 microRNA {{precursor}} is {{a precursor}} microRNA specific to Drosophila species. In Drosophila melanogaster {{there are three}} mir-6 paralogs called dme-mir-6-1, dme-mir-6-2, dme-mir-6-3, which are clustered together in the genome. The extents of these hairpin precursors are estimated based on hairpin prediction. Each precursor is generated following the cleavage of a longer primary transcript in the nucleus, and is exported in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, precursors are further processed by the enzyme Dicer, generating ~22 nucleotide products from each arm of the hairpin. The products generated from the 3' arm of each mir-6 precursor have identical sequences. Both 5' and 3' <b>mature</b> <b>products</b> are experimentally validated.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} 3 C-like proteinase of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible for processing of the 1 a and 1 a/ 1 b polyproteins to three <b>mature</b> <b>products</b> of 24, 10, and 100 kDa (Liuet al., 1994, 1997; Ng and Liu, 1998). The C-terminal cleavage site of the 100 -kDa protein was defined to be the Q 891 (1 b) -S 892 (1 b) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 15, 129 to 15, 134 (Liu and Brown, 1995). In this report, other cleavage sites of the 3 C-like proteinase in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF 1 b region were mapped by coexpression, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Using two ORF 1 b-specific antisera, V 58 and V 17, three more Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds, encoded by nucleotides 16, 929 to 16, 934, 18, 492 to 18, 497, and 19, 506 to 19, 511, respectively, were demonstrated to be the cleavage sites of the 3 C-like proteinase.
