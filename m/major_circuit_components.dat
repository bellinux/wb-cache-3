25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and <b>major</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>components)</b> also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis presents a study on 2. 45 GHz rectifying antennas (rectennas). The rectenna is a major component in a microwave power transmission system. The main feature is the conversion efficiency from microwave power to direct current (DC) power. <b>Major</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> of the rectenna element include the antenna, input and Output low pass filters, rectifying diode, and DC resistive load. Each component plays a vital role in maximizing the conversion efficiency. Thus, each component is reviewed separately. The rectifying diode is the key component in the rectenna circuit and understanding its characteristics is vital. A method has been devised to experimentally characterize a packaged GaAs Schottky barrier diode by inserting it in a microstrip test mount. The nonlinear equivalent circuit parameters of the diode are determined by a small signal test method. The method analyzes the diode's scattering parameters at various bias levels. A large signal measurement using the same test mount has also been configured to determine the power conversion efficiency from microwave to DC as well as determining the deembedded network impedance of the diode. A 85 % conversion efficiency was achieved in the test mount when the diode was properly tuned. A small 6 element rectenna was manufactured, tested and flown onboard a Japanese sounding rocket in the first demonstration of a microwave power transmission system in space. The dual polarized rectenna was configured as a detector of microwave power. Test results and flight data from the Microwave Energy Transmission in Space (METS) experiment are given. Because the diode generates undesirable harmonic radiation, three frequency selective surfaces (FSSS) were designed to reduce the second harmonic radiation. Theoretical results agree fairly well with experiments for all these experiments. A FSS was tested with a 20 element rectenna which achieved a 10 dB suppression of the second harmonic and the conversion efficiency decreased less than 1 %...|$|E

40|$|The APS linac {{beam energy}} must be stable to within {+-} 1 % {{to match the}} energy {{acceptance}} of the positron accumulator ring. The klystron pulse modulators must therefore provide a pulse-to-pulse repeatability of 0. 1 % {{in order for the}} beam to have the required energy stability. The modulators have had difficulty achieving the necessary repeatability since the pulse forming network (PFN) charging scheme does not include a deQing circuit. Several of the <b>major</b> charging <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> are also less reliable than desired. In order to increase operating reliability and to improve pulse-to-pulse stability, it is planned to replace the high voltage power supplies in all modulators with constant-current power supplies. A new modulator charging supply that contains two EMI series 303 constant-current power supplies was constructed. Each of these EMI supplies delivers 1. 5 A at up to 40 kV. One supply is sufficient for linac operation at up to 45 Hz, and two supplies in parallel enable linac operation at the nominal rf repetition rate of 60 Hz. This paper discusses test results from the new modulator, and also describes the existing modulators and their performance limitations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a design methodology of an electromagnetic transient analysis program {{based on an}} objectoriented approach. Two important features of the object oriented programming are (i) abstraction of data and their procedures using classes and (ii) derivation of a new class from an existing class using the concept of inheritance. In the proposed design methodology, first the base class, from which all kinds of <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> are derived using inheritance, is defined. When a specific <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> {{is derived from the}} base class, the parameters, the internal variables, and the behavior of the component are defined and described in the code defining the derived class. This means that each <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> manages its data and knows how to initialize and update itself, that is, the circuit solver does not have to manage and know them. In this way, we can separately write the code of the circuit solver and that of <b>circuit</b> <b>components,</b> and thus, coding is simplified and code maintainability is enhanced. Especially, adding a new component does not require modifications in the circuit solver code. Using the proposed approach, a new transient analysis program named “XTAP ” (eXpandable Transient Analysis Program) has been created. Some practical implementation issues are also presented in the paper. Index Terms — Circuit simulation, Electromagnetic transient analysis, Object oriented programming, Power systems, an...|$|R

The differential fault simulation algorithm developed for gate-level circuits is adapted for use at the switch-level. Differential fault simulation provides excellent performance with minimum memory requirements, although it incurs a higher overhead at the switch-level than at the gate-level due to the dynamic memory properties of MOS circuits...|$|R
