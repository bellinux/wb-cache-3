50|$|Daniell Revenaugh has invented and {{patented}} a Lower Lid for {{the grand}} piano which projects the sound more effectively. It {{has been used in}} concert by pianists such as Martha Argerich, Peter Serkin, André Watts, Radu Lupu and Alexander Toradze. He has also patented a <b>muting</b> <b>device</b> for grand pianos which protects downstairs neighbors.|$|E
50|$|Discovery is {{the only}} {{situation}} in which data collisions can occur assuming all connected devices behave correctly. The controller will broadcast a discovery command to all devices and await a response. If {{there are more than}} one device connected, the simultaneous responses will likely result in a data collision, and the controller will not receive a correctly formatted response. The controller will then refine its search to a smaller range of UIDs according to a binary search pattern. Once the controller receives a correct response it will attempt to <b>mute</b> the responding <b>device.</b> After a successful <b>mute,</b> the <b>device</b> is no longer allowed to respond to discovery messages, and the controller can continue searching for other devices. Once all devices has been muted (no responses are received to discovery commands), the discovery process is finished and the controller will hold a list of all connected devices.|$|R
2500|$|The Priv {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. The Verge {{felt that}} the Priv's design was [...] "quite good", noting that the thinness of the device's two halves averted it from feeling [...] "top-heavy" [...] when its keyboard was in use. The Wall Street Journal described the frame and curved screen as being [...] "a pleasure to hold and look at." [...] Ars Technica was critical of the device's overall build quality, with its back cover described as feeling [...] "spongy" [...] its sliding mechanism described as being [...] "scratchy" [...] and [...] "friction-filled", while its curved screen was considered a [...] "rather useless gimmick" [...] that was inappropriate for the device's target market. Ars Technica also panned the hardware mute button for being [...] "counterintuitive", as it does not <b>mute</b> the <b>device</b> unless it is already playing audio, otherwise triggering the system volume controls. The hardware keyboard received mixed reviews. The Wall Street Journal described the keyboard as being the [...] "smartphone equivalent of a Colonial butter churn", noting that, although it was faster to type on in comparison to virtual keyboards, the BlackBerry Classic had a larger and wider keyboard. Ars Technica felt it was [...] "unpleasant" [...] to use due to its size, flat keys and how it interacts with the OS. PC Magazine described its display as being [...] "beautiful", while Ars Technica felt {{that it had a}} [...] "grainy" [...] color reproduction.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mute</b> is a <b>device</b> {{fitted to}} a musical {{instrument}} to alter the sound produced: by affecting the timbre (or [...] "tone"), reducing the volume, or most commonly both. The use of a mute is usually indicated in musical notation by the Italian direction con sordino ("with mute") and removed with the direction senza sordino ("without mute") or via sordino ("mute off"). On string instruments of the violin family, the mute {{takes the form of}} a device attached to the bridge of the instrument, dampening vibrations and resulting in a [...] "softer", darker and more somber sound. On the cello and double bass, a wolf mute is often attached to the G-string (on the cello) and on the A-string (on the bass) between the bridge and the tailpiece to eliminate the wolf tone. On the guitar, a player may palm mute their guitar. Some instruments, such as the Fender Jaguar and the Rickenbacker 4001 and 4003 electric bass guitars have built-in string mutes.|$|R
40|$|A <b>mute</b> is a <b>device</b> that {{is placed}} in the bell of a brass {{instrument}} to alter its sound. However, when a straight mute is used with a brass instrument, the frequencies of its first impedance peaks are slightly modified, and a mistuned, extra impedance peak appears. This peak affects the instrument’s playability, making some lower notes difficult or impossible to produce when playing at low dynamic levels. To understand and suppress this effect, an active mute with embedded microphone and speaker has been developed. A control loop with gain and phase shifting is used to control the damping and frequency of the extra impedance peak. The stability of the controlled system is studied and then the effect of the control on the input impedance and radiated sound of the trombone is investigated. It is shown that the playability problem results from a decrease in the input impedance magnitude at the playing frequency, caused by a trough located on the low frequency side of the extra impedance peak. When the extra impedance peak is suppressed, the playability of the note is restored. Meanwhile, when the extra impedance peak is moved in frequency, the playability problem position is shifted as well...|$|R
