[...] The album was produced by Rick Rubin and was recorded at Oceanway Studios.|$|E
2500|$|Faldo had a {{reputation}} for being an insular character who did not engage in any of the usual social courtesies. He generally kept other players at arm's length. Faldo was described as having [...] "an intense focus that peers found less than endearing." [...] In 2002, Faldo's former Ryder Cup colleague Sandy Lyle said: [...] "I've never known Nick.

2500|$|In 1994, after {{overcoming}} her {{drug addiction}} by spending several weeks {{with her father}} and grandmother, Jameson relocated to Los Angeles to live with Nikki Tyler. Her first movie after that was Silk Stockings. Later in 1995, Wicked Pictures, a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract.

2500|$|Taylor's {{originality}} {{has been}} emphasized by several critics writing of her work; thus Lynn Emanuel writes of Captive Voices, [...] "It {{is a complex}} and unexpected convergence of the influences of modernism and a wholly original, native genius. Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate to <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> in the way that you know that all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on August 8, 2006. Cassie made television appearances on MTV's Total Request Live and BET's 106 & Park to support the album on its release week. Her first televised performances were described as [...] "rocky" [...] and [...] "less-than-stellar," [...] but Diddy {{said that it was}} due to her inexperience, continuing that he would be [...] "with her through her development," [...] and has no [...] "question on her ability [...]" [...] Cassie later added: [...] "I don’t think I should have done those shows. But I didn't know I had a choice. I would sit in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I got out there and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of people are watching <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and are here waiting to see me die, when {{you wake up in the}} morning, you aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, because you never really know someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> for 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what they are talking about ... people who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E
2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with <b>me</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party.

30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment.
