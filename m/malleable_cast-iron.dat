50|$|<b>Malleable</b> (porous) <b>cast-iron</b> is {{manufactured}} by white tempering. White tempering {{is used to}} burn off excess carbon, by heating it for extended amounts of time in an oxidizing environment. The cast iron will usually be held at temperatures as high as 1000 C {{for as long as}} 60 hours. The heating is followed by a slow cooling rate of around 10 °C (18 °F) per hour. The entire process may last 160 hours or more. This causes the cementite to decompose from the ledeburite, and then the carbon burns out through the surface of the metal, increasing the malleability of the cast-iron.|$|R
5000|$|White {{cast-iron}} {{is composed}} mostly of a microstructure called ledeburite mixed with pearlite. Ledeburite is very hard, making the cast-iron very brittle. If the white cast-iron has a hypoeutectic composition, {{it is usually}} tempered to produce <b>malleable</b> or ductile <b>cast-iron.</b> Two methods of tempering are used, called [...] "white tempering" [...] and [...] "black tempering." [...] The purposes of both tempering methods is to cause the cementite within the ledeburite to decompose, increasing the ductility.|$|R
50|$|The {{period after}} Waterloo {{and the end}} of the {{continental}} wars was a time of much improvement of the fabric of the country, and engineering skills were much in demand. Besides his work for the Northern Lighthouse Board, he acted as a consulting engineer on many occasions, and worked with Rennie, Alexander Nimmo, Thomas Telford, William Walker, Archibald Elliot and William Cubitt. Projects included roads, bridges, harbours, canals and railways, and river navigations. He designed and oversaw the construction of the Hutcheson Bridge in Glasgow, and the Regent Bridge and approaches from the East to Edinburgh. He projected a number of canals and railways which were not built; and new and improved designs for bridges, some later adopted and implemented by his successors. He invented the movable jib and balance cranes as necessary part of his lighthouse construction; and George Stephenson acknowledged his lead in the selection of <b>malleable</b> rather than <b>cast-iron</b> rails for railways.|$|R
