Likewise psychological factors have been associated with physical health and illnesses. This motivated research into the field of <b>mental</b> health <b>computing,</b> which focuses on computer support systems for understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress or dysfunction, but also on electronic coaching of individuals to promote wellness. This paper describes past, current and future research work of the Delft <b>Mental</b> Health <b>Computing</b> Lab focusing around three research directions: (1) the recreation of relevant realities; (2) intelligent agents for health interventions; and (3) engineering methodologies for applications in the field of <b>mental</b> health <b>computing.</b> Keywords—mental health computing; cyberpsychology, virtual reality; ecoaching; software engineering methodolgies.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} {{infantile}} autism using computed tomographic scanning {{emphasized the importance}} of studying cases of classic autism (Kanner's syndrome) without complicating conditions such as <b>mental</b> retardation. <b>Computed</b> tomographic scan studies of such patients reported no evidence of anatomical abnormalities of cerebral hemi-spheres or of subcortical structures, which are defined by landmarks such as the lateral ventricles and lentiform nuclei. Examination of the cerebellum was not mentioned. The most recent postmortem neuropathologic study reported significant cerebellar abnormality, but the study was of a severely retarded autistic individual. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we have found in vivo evidence of a significant and unusual cerebellar malformation in a person with the classic form of autism uncomplicated by mental retardation (current nonverbal IQ = 112), epilepsy, history of drug use, postnatal trauma, or disease. The finding showed hypoplasia of the declive, folium, and tuber in posterior vermis, but not of the anterior vermis, and hypoplasia of only the medial aspect of each cerebellar hemisphere. The right posterior cerebral hemisphere also showed pathologic findings. © 1987, American Medical Association. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} rare case of massive {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage {{resulting from a}} small, superficially-located supratentorial cavernous malformation, or cavernoma. These lesions rarely lead to massive, life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhages. A 17 -year-old female presented with a 3 -week history of declining <b>mental</b> status. Brain <b>computed</b> tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sizable intracranial hemorrhage, within the right occipital region, associated with a small nodule at the hematoma’s posterior margin. An emergency operation removed the entire hematoma and nodule. Histological examination of the nodule was compatible with a diagnosis of cavernous malformation.

Here we show that saccadic distortions extend to abstract quantities, affecting the representation of symbolic numerical magnitude. Subjects consistently underestimated the results of rapidly <b>computed</b> <b>mental</b> additions and subtractions, when the operands were briefly displayed before a saccade. However, the recognition of the number symbols was unimpaired. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a common, abstract metric encoding magnitude along multiple dimensions.

40|$|Pervasive {{healthcare}} and citizen-centered care paradigm are moving the healthcare outside the hospital environment. Healthcare delivery {{is becoming more}} personalized and decentralized, focusing on prevention and proactive services with a complete view of health and wellbeing. The concept of wellness {{has been used to}} describe this holistic view of health, which focuses on physical, social, and <b>mental</b> well-being. Pervasive <b>computing</b> makes it possible to collect information and offer services anytime and anywhere. To support pervasive healthcare with wellness approaches, semantic interoperability is needed between all actors and information sources in the ecosystem. This study focuses on the domain of personal wellness and analyzes related concepts, relationships, and environments. As a result of this study, we have created an information model that focuses on the citizens’ perspectives and conceptualizations of personal wellness. The model has been created based on empirical research conducted with focus groups. Copyright © 2012 Antto Seppälä et al.

40|$|Congenital {{bilateral}} perisylvian syndrome (CBPS) is {{a recently}} described, neuronal migration disorder, characterized by pseudobulbar palsy, epilepsy and mental retardation and bilateral perisylvian dysplasia. A 15 -year-old boy {{was diagnosed with}} CBPS according to the typical clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. The patient was suffering from atypical absence seizures, repeating daily in spite of antiepileptic drug therapy, since age 7 years. He had also experienced rare generalized tonic-clonic seizures and complex partial seizures. Neurological examination showed severe restriction of tongue movements, severe dysarthria, dysphagia, facial diplegia, mild pyramidal signs and moderate <b>mental</b> retardation. A <b>computed</b> tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated bilateral perisylvian enlargement. The diagnosis was corrected with MRI after six years. Frequent irregular generalized spike and wave abnormalities and focal sharp and slow waves over the posterior regions of both hemispheres were shown by electroencephalograms (EEG). The patient was treated with Na-Valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine but did now show any significant change in seizure frequency in the eight-year follow-up period. Intractable seizures, mental retardation and particularly congenital pseudobulbar palsy suggest this congenital entity. Those patients who exhibit these typically clinical features, must have MRI...|$|R
40|$|Although still {{innovative}} and not largely disseminated, Computational Thinking is being {{considered as a}} critical skill for students in the 21 st century. It involves many skills, but programming abilities {{seem to be a}} core aspect since they foster {{the development of a new}} way of thinking that is key to the solution of problems that require a combination of human <b>mental</b> power and <b>computing</b> power capacity. This paper presents an exploratory study developed to select psychological assessment tests that can be used to identify and measure Computational Thinking cognitive processes, associated to the programming component, so that strategies can be developed to promote it. After the literature review, we identified four central cognitive processes implied in programming, therefore important to Computational Thinking, and accordingly selected a set of four tests that were administered to a sample of 12 introductory programming students. Our results suggest that spatial reasoning and general intelligence are crucial dimensions for introductory programming, being also correlated to the students’ academic success in this area. However, arithmetic reasoning and attention to detail tests did not correlate. Based on these results, directions for future research have been defined in order to effectively identify and develop the core cognitive processes of programming, ergo, to help develop Computational Thinking.

40|$|Background: Mental {{disorders}} {{are an important}} public health problem because of their prevalence and the probability of long-term work disability. The incidence of sickness absence with mental disorders has increased between 1985 and 2000, but {{little is known about}} trends in recent years. This study investigated the incidence of sickness absence due to common mental disorders in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2007. Methods: Observational study in about 1 million employees, working in various economic sectors, representative for the Dutch workforce. Sickness absence episodes were medically certified by an occupational physician utmost in the fifth week of absence. The 12 -month incidence of medically certified sickness absence was calculated for each year by dividing incident episodes by the number of employees. Sick days due to common <b>mental</b> disorders were <b>computed</b> as percentage {{of the total number of}} medically certified sick days. Results: The 12 -month incidence of sickness absence due to common mental disorders was 2. 2 % in 2001, increased to 2. 7 % in 2004 and decreased thereafter to 2. 0 % in 2007. The percentage of sick days due to common mental disorders was highest in the education sector (39 %) followed by financial services (31 %) and health care (30 %). Conclusions: In the Netherlands, the incidence of sickness absence with common mental disorders was highest in 2004 and has decreased since then probably because of changes in sick leave compensation, economic market position and company policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative study of biological processes as integrated systems not just isolated parts. Goals: • Model causal networks of biomolecular processes and interactions in a logical framework • Develop formal models that are {{as close as possible}} to domain expert’s <b>mental</b> models • <b>Compute</b> with and analyze these networks • Abstract and refine logical models • Simulate or use deduction to check properties • Make predictions, experiment, update model 3 Pathway Logic Pathway Logic (PL) is an approach to modeling biological entities and processes based on rewriting logic. Signal transduction processes are modeled at different levels of abstraction in the PL knowledge base. The resulting signaling networks can be queried using formal methods tools. For example, given an initial state: • execute [...] show me some signaling pathway • search [...] show me all pathways leading to a specified final condition • model-check [...] is there a pathway with certain given properties? 4 The Pathway Logic Assistant (PLA) Provides interactive visual representation of PL models. Using PLA one can • choose a model/initial state • display the network of reactions for a chosen model • formulate queries [...] specify goals/avoids • display relevant subnet or pathway • compare two subnets and/or pathways • show knockouts • display downstream impact of given components • color pathway according to gene expression levels • animate coloring of gene expression time series 5 6 How is signaling representing in the PL knowledge base?

40|$|New {{advances}} in computer vision techniques will revolutionize {{the way we}} interact with computers, as they, together with other improvements, will help us build machines that understand us better. The face is the main non-verbal channel for human-human communication and contains valuable information about emotion, mood, and <b>mental</b> state. Affective <b>computing</b> researchers have investigated widely how facial expressions {{can be used for}} automatically recognizing affect and mental states. Nowadays, physiological signals can be measured by video-based techniques, which can also be utilised for emotion detection. Physiological signals, are an important indicator of internal feelings, and are more robust against social masking. This thesis focuses on computer vision techniques to detect facial expression and physiological changes for recognizing non-basic and natural emotions during human-computer interaction. It covers all stages of the research process from data acquisition, integration and application. Most previous studies focused on acquiring data from prototypic basic emotions acted out under laboratory conditions. To evaluate the proposed method under more practical conditions, two different scenarios were used for data collection. In the first scenario, a set of controlled stimulus was used to trigger the user’s emotion. The second scenario aimed at capturing more naturalistic emotions that might occur during a writing activity. In the second scenario, the engagement level of the participants with other affective states was the target of the system. For the first time this thesis explores how video-based physiological measures can be used in affect detection. Video-based measuring of physiological signals is a new technique that needs more improvement to be used in practical applications. A machine learning approach is proposed and evaluated to improve the accuracy of heart rate (HR) measurement using an ordinary camera during a naturalistic interaction with computer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that women's {{education}} is protective against corporal punishment (CP) of children. However, the effect that women's exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) has on the association between women's education and children's CP has not been studied. Objective: To understand how the interaction between women's exposure to IPV and their education level influences the occurrence of children's CP at the household level. Methods: We selected 10, 156 women who had at least one child less than 16 years old from cross-sectional data from the 2006 – 2007 Nicaraguan Demographic and Health Survey. Children's CP was defined as the punishment of children by slapping them, hitting them with a fist, or hitting them with a rope, belt, stick, or other object. IPV was measured by using a conflict tactic scale. The WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 (SRQ- 20) was used to assess the women's <b>mental</b> health. We <b>computed</b> adjusted risk ratios (ARR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator. Results: Women's exposure to IPV was associated with a 10 – 17 % increase in the risk of children's CP. IPV and children's CP were associated with impaired women's mental health. Women's lifetime exposure to emotional IPV and controlling behavior by a partner significantly decreased the protective effect from women's high education level on children's CP. When women were exposed to emotional IPV, the protective effect from having a college education decreased from ARR= 0. 61 (95 % CI 0. 47 – 0. 80) to ARR= 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 19). A similar pattern was found among women exposed to controlling behavior by a partner, the protective effect decreased from ARR= 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 90) to ARR= 0. 86 (95 % CI 0. 70 – 1. 06). Conclusion: This study shows how significant gains in one positive social determinant of children's well-being can be undermined when it interacts with men's violence toward women. Policies that aim to end children's CP must include actions to end women's exposure to IPV...|$|R
