500|$|Over the years, drifts {{of up to}} [...] {{kilograms}} {{per annum}} in the national prototype kilograms relative to the international prototype kilogram have been detected. There was no way of determining whether the national prototypes were gaining mass or whether the IPK was losing mass. At the 21st meeting of the CGPM (1999), national laboratories were urged to investigate ways of breaking {{the link between the}} kilogram and a specific artefact. Newcastle University <b>metrologist</b> Peter Cumpson has since identified mercury vapour absorption or carbonaceous contamination as possible causes of this drift.|$|E

40|$|This {{report for}} the Software Support for Metrology {{programme}} considers mathematical modelling at the nanoscale and its application to problems in metrology. The motivation for the report arises from the recognition that modelling at the molecular scale is becoming more important for <b>metrologists</b> working on programmes funded by the National Measurement System Directorate (NMSD). It has been drafted with <b>metrologists</b> from other NMSD programmes in mind. It aims to set out the most important mathematical modelling issues that <b>metrologists</b> who need to tackle nanoscale problems should take into account. Its purpose is both to provide <b>metrologists</b> with {{advice on how to}} assess the potential contribution that nanoscale modelling techniques may be able to make and to assist them in identifying sources of help with modelling problems. It describes some of the software available and suggests ways in which non-commercial software can be used to gain experience in modelling at the nanoscale...|$|R
