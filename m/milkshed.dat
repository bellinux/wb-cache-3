The veterinary clinics appeared to overestimate their services {{in the areas of}} nutritional consulting and heifer rearing. The primary determinant of a producer's perception of being on a herd health program was the occurrence of regularly scheduled reproduction visits. Producers who perceived themselves as being on a herd health program also believed that they received more services in the other four main areas of production medicine. Grouping of producers, based on whether or not herd records were analyzed by their veterinarian, showed a clustering of adopters of more comprehensive herd health services as clients of two practices.

40|$|Ethiopia’s rural {{development}} policy and strategies place in centre stage the transformation of smallholder subsistence agriculture to market-orientation to promote commercialization of the sector. Smallholder dairy production contributes 50 % of the livestock output and about 30 % of employment, with still a large untapped potential. Despite a plethora of projects and expressed policy intent, the dairy sector did never really take off. One of major bottlenecks as revealed by many studies is problems related to coverage, responsiveness and efficiency of supportive service delivery. Multiple service providers -public, private and third sector- are increasingly emerging in the dairy sub-sector, which calls for effective and efficient coordination mechanisms and enabling policy environment. The pluralistic service delivery framework was {{used to analyze the}} functioning of pluralistic service delivery system in Debrezeit <b>milkshed,</b> which has relatively developed and market-oriented dairy systems. In the <b>milkshed,</b> dairy sector is currently in a transition towards market-orientation, with private sector investment and multiple actor involvement in the service delivery. This district also houses the most advanced and largest dairy co-operative in the country. Primary data was collected from 150 randomly selected smallholder dairy producing households located in urban, peri-urban and rural areas; and also from various service providers. The data generated by Rapid Appraisal of Dairy Innovation Systems by IPMS project in Ada’a and review of government policy and strategy documents supplemented information generated by household survey. The results reveal that while the dairy service provision is mainly dominated by the public sector, the roles of private sector in providing animal feed, product marketing and processing, micro finance, veterinary services are increasing. However, there is no mechanism to coordinate multiple service providers for them to effectively function as a system. Forage seed/cutting material supplier and vet clinical service providers in the peri-urban and rural sub systems whereas dairy advisory service providers are among the missing actors in the <b>milkshed.</b> In addition, the public sector lack competence to facilitate financial and market links and regulate services and accredit the private service providers in the <b>milkshed.</b> The policy and institutional analysis revealed that existing government policies and strategies are important steps forwards for the commercialization of the sector with out any restriction on non public service providers to participate in the market. Nevertheless, success in pluralistic dairy service delivery, among others, is constrained by inadequacy of the existing policies and strategies (lack and/or delay in the livestock policy and no division of public and private role in animal health service), still more enabling environment and institutional arrangements setback. Policies are required to reconfigure roles of the public sector to take up the missing role or encourage non public actors to play it and avail clear policies that as to what type services to be provided by the public and non public sector. In addition, the required favorable conditions for the promotion of non public actors needs to became visible. This study analyzed cost sharing as an option for developing sustainable and responsive service delivery, by assessing producers’ willingness to pay for advisory service using Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) method. Results show that 71. 3 % of the producers described themselves as willing to pay for dairy advisory service if their income from dairy would increase. While exploring options for development of a functional and effective pluralistic service delivery system to support the commercialization of smallholder dairy production, this study comes up with options for providing and financing dairy related services that involves the public, private, and third sectors.

The study revealed that the channel choices available to producers include selling to collectors, wholesalers, retailers, and directly to consumers. The multinomial model output indicated that being in rural areas, breed type, separate milking place, and supply of hay negatively determined the choice to sell to wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. In contrast, education status and milk storage duration positively determined producers’ choice not to sell to collectors. The major recommendations include provision of training, disseminating dairy technologies, encouraging value chain actors to add values; and enhancing collective actions of producers...|$|E
40|$|In the Ethiopian {{context of}} {{economic}} transition period and high urban population growth (3, 8 percent), {{the problem of}} supply of dairy products to Addis-Ababa is addressed through research results produced by CIRAD-EMVT and its partners in Ethiopia (ILCA, ILCI, NARS). The paper discusses the dairy commodity system with an overall description {{and analysis of the}} production, distribution and consumption features in the Addis-Ababa <b>milkshed</b> and with a particular focus on peri-urban and intra-urban areas. Four sub-systems in the dairy commodity systems aimed at supplying Addis-Ababa are described: - the traditional system supplying butter used in Ethiopian cooking from rural areas; - the traditional system supplying cosmetic butter and curdled products (ayib); the modern sector assembling milk from state farms, peri-urban and urban private producers, and providing pasteurized milk and standardized western-type dairy products through both private and public networks of operators; - the traditional urban and peri-urban sector of small producers delivering raw milk to households in their neighbourhood. About 23 000 dairy cows were enumerated in the urban and peri-urban area of Addis-Ababa. Most of them are crossbred or zebu type and they are reared through a diversity of rural and urban farming systems including urban zero-grazing systems and mixed farming systems with association of vegetable crops. Results from research indicate that 35 000 metric tons of milk from which 30 000 are processed or traded to the Addis-Ababa market through retailers and processors from the public and private system. The public system (DDE=Dairy Development Enterprise) provides processed milk out of 1 570 metric tons of milk from its own rural and peri-urban production, added to 3 170 tons from private - mainly peri-urban - processors. The milk assembled from urban and peri-urban private farms and processed by the private sector amounts to about 25 000 tons. About 4 360 tons are sold as pasteurized or raw milk, while 2 950 tons are sold as processed products. In this context, changes and innovations in the market for dairy, services and inputs are as important to take into account as traditional, more stable features. The Addis-Ababa <b>milkshed</b> can serve as a contemporary monitoring system of changes in urbanization and consumption features, spatial organization, productivity gain opportunities, institutionalization of the sector, enabling capacity of laws and cultural rules. This monitoring system is necessary for a relevant analysis of city-countryside relationships in a dual challenge of food security and economic Development for the operators in the commodity system...|$|E
40|$|Smallholder dairy {{production}} {{is a widespread}} and growing activity in the Kenyan highlands, and a potentially important source of livelihood for many poor farmers with road access to urban areas of East and Southern Africa. Yet both market participation and net prices received vary widely across households. It is hypothesized that transport difficulties over poor roads directly affect farmer ability and willingness {{to participate in this}} market for a highly perishable commodity, even where asset and information levels would otherwise permit such participation. Furthermore, otherwise identical milk sales in a given market can yield very different farm-gate milk prices across farms, for the same reason, depending on the location of the farm. A Heckman iterative selection model is fitted to explain market participation and milk prices received across households for 712 observations on marketing (or non-marketing) of milk by Kenyan smallholders in the greater Nairobi <b>milkshed.</b> GIS-derived variables for distance and transport costs are combined with survey-derived variables for household characteristics to model market participation and the formation of farm-level milk prices.

40|$|Market-oriented {{smallholder}} dairy in Fogera has {{an opportunity}} for growth because of growing urban population in the district itself {{as well as in}} the wider Bahr Dar–Gondar <b>milkshed.</b> IPMS in 2005 introduced a participatory market-oriented dairy value chain development approach with partner organizations. IPMS together with its partners also identified gaps in the dairy value chain through Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) and also designed interventions involving key value chain actors. This approach included increased use of knowledge capturing and sharing by the extension services. Major production interventions were the development of communal grazing areas through clearance of noxious weed called Hygrophilla auriculata and introduction of area enclosure, backyard fodder development and increased use of rice crop residues. Input service supply interventions included community-based trypanosomosis control and bulls stations. IPMS and its partners also provided the required support for establishment of two milk processing marketing cooperatives. Communal grazing area development is now practised in 16 villages (PAs) and harvested biomass production was estimated at 7 to 11 t of DM/year. As a result of the cut-and-carry system, the proportion of legumes increased, thus improving its nutritive value. The increased availability of the rice straw and bran resulting from rice value chain development in Fogera has also impacted dairy production. Urea treatments of rice straw as well as supplementary feeding with rice bran were demonstrated in 13 PAs. An on-farm experiment conducted by an MSc student indicated doubling of daily milk yields. However, use of straw could be increased further if urea for the treatment of straw could be made available in the dry season. Trypanosomosis control introduced in infested areas has significantly reduced the number of infected animals and the program is now institutionalized by regional, district and NGO partners. The introduction of bull stations resulted in increased number of improved Fogera breed cows and crossbreed with Holstein-Frisians. However, the number of improved dairy cows is still low and the District should consider the recently introduced mass insemination approach with the help of hormones. Marketing and processing of milk in urban and peri-urban areas through formation of small cooperatives has started; however, impact is still limited due to lack of business orientation, and alternative marketing outlets for individual producers. While some linkages were made with the larger Bahr Dar <b>milkshed,</b> more attention needs to be paid to this market once milk production increases. A household survey conducted in 2009, which assessed the combined impact of all interventions, showed significant differences in milk quantities sold by adopter and non-adopter households in the urban areas and doubling of butter production/sales in the rural areas. It is noted that this additional butter sales benefits rural women since they manage the production and sale of butter. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E

This study, conducted in five <b>milkshed</b> districts of Tamil Nadu, has estimated the economic losses arising from milk fever, based on the data collected from a random sample of 557 milk fever affected bovines (516 cows and 41 she buffaloes) during 2005 - 08. For assessing economic losses caused by milk fever, cost of medicines, veterinarian’s fee, cost of additional labour utilized, loss due to reduction in milk output, cost of animals dead and culled have been considered. The prevalence of milk fever has been found 13. 67 per cent in cows and 11. 99 per cent in buffaloes across the study districts. The total loss has been found as Rs 1, 068 per affected cow and Rs 665 per buffalo. Taking into account the observed prevalence of milk fever, the population of milch cows and buffaloes and the per animal loss due to milk fever has been estimated to be of Rs 40. 62 crore in the state, which is a substantial damage to the dairy farming community. Some suggestions for prevention and management of milk fever have been given in the study. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the economics of a planned system of supplementary irrigation and pasture improvement on a typical Richmond Valley dairy farm. In developing the plan for the farm, consideration is, given to a range of assumptions concerning the farmer's resources of labour and machinery. Similarly, three different levels of production response are considered; these represent assumed variations in the managerial skills of farmers. Thus, with a typical initial farm production of 8. 650 lb. butterfat, the gains assumed are: (1) an increase of 4, 830 lb. butterfat under "good management"; (2) an increase of 6, 040 lb. butterfat under "outstanding management"; and (3) an increase of 3, 620 lb. butterfat under "average management". For each set of assumptions, on the production gain achieved and the resource situation of the typical farmer, a credit budget is developed for a ten-year period. With "good management", when the only major investment is the irrigation plant and when the farmer does not need to employ extra labour, income gains are sufficient to ensure rapid repayment of the overdraft. If, however, the farmer is older and finds it necessary to employ a youth, the "pay back period" is much longer than ten years and the plan is clearly not attractive, except as a means of financing the return of a son to the property. Again, if {{there is no need to}} employ extra labour, the income generated is sufficient to cover investment in a tractor and implements, as well as the irrigation plant, with a pay back period of ten years, or in a herringbone <b>milkshed</b> in the third year of development, with a pay back period of eleven years.

40|$|AGRICULTURAL ECONOMISTS have {{a long-standing}} {{interest}} in. fi {{the analysis of}} land-use patterns, interregional competition, supply potential, and other spatial aspects of the agricultural industry. The land-use studies of the 1930 's [15], studies of interregional competition in the dairy industry in the same decade [II], and the capacity studies during World War II [7]are all early examples of this interest. Because of lack of data and limited computational capacity, these early studies were unable either to include all relevant competitive products and important producing areas or to incorporate enough simultaneous regional interdependencies. Data deficiencies (both quantitative and qualitative) still impose limitations, but modem computers have eliminated many of the computational restrictions. In the mid- 1950 's, tor example, we had difficulty finding a computer which could solve a problem with only 210 restraints and 310 real variables. Now, thanks to improved computers and decomposition algorithms, a model with 4, 000 restraints and 37, 000 vari-ables does not exhaust computer capacity. Unfortunately, {{there has been no}} comparable improvement in the supply of data. Although other types of models are used, most spatial models, linear or nonlinear, and most supply-response (representative-farm) models are ac-tivity-analysis models. Spatial models use a region as the basic producing unit; supply-response models use an individual (representative or typical) farm. Supply-response models try to predict market supply under a given set of market conditions [...] ignoring, for the most part, interactions between farms in different regions or, for that matter, between farms in the same region. Spatial models try to take account of interregional competitive forces by explicitly including demand restraints and permitting interre-gional commodity shipments. Insofar as they are inconsistent with regional effects, individual-farm effects are largely ignored. In 1955, a supply-response model of the Des Moines <b>milkshed</b> [9, 10] was started in Iowa.

Two factors triggered the need for understanding the innovation systems: Ethiopian dairy subsector {{has not been able to}} take-off despite decades of research and development efforts; and the context for the subsector development is changing. The purpose of the research was to identify organizational, institutional and policy options to facilitate market-driven and knowledge-based smallholder dairy development in the country. Specifically, the analysis looked at contextual factors determining opportunities and necessities for innovation; the key innovation systems actors, pattern of interaction between them; coordination mechanisms; and the subsector development policy and strategy. The investigation was based on a survey of actors and their roles and interactions, review of policy, and project documents and available empirical evidence. The research identified constraints and challenges relating to market, supportive services, interaction of actors, inter-organizational coordination, and gaps in the subsector development policy and strategy. Finally,options are identified that can enhance commercialization and innovation. The options include: strengthening dairy cooperatives with emphasis on their business-orientation, linking them, where appropriate, vertically to processors and input suppliers, and strategically linking dairy development intervention to informal markets through food security/food transfer programs and institutionalized school feeding programs; public support for the development of private service and pluralistic service delivery system, alongside strengthening public capacity for performing regulatory and quality assurance functions effectively; formulating national dairy development policy and strategy to ensure coordinated policy implementation on the ground; encouraging the integration of emerging dairy cooperatives at higher levels and capacity building to enable them to demand service, command accountability, and serve as a mouthpiece of producers; capitalizing on the on-going Business Process Re-engineering for revising the prevailing reward systems in public research and extension to encourage innovation and impactorientation; creating incentive system such as leverage fund and competitive grant to encourage intervention-based public–private innovation partnership; and strengthening dairy platform at woreda and/or <b>milkshed</b> level for achieving of better impact through continuous incremental improvements and to facilitate scaling out and up of successful experience to achieve wider impact and inform higher policymaking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Raw, unpasteurized milk is {{regularly}} consumed {{in some communities}} in Ghana, especially among the Fulani ethnic group. However, unpasteurized raw milk has been implicated in outbreaks of food borne diseases, including listeriosis, in many countries. The production and consumption of milk has become an informal cottage industry in Ghana. Recent years have also seen increasing reports of human illness compatible with listeriosis. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the risk of consuming raw milk and its products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the pathogen that causes listeriosis, in Ghana. This was the first study on the risk of exposure to listeriosis from raw milk in Ghana. METHODS: A survey was carried out in selected raw milk consuming communities to assess the potential prevalence of listeriosis and to establish the raw milk pathways and milk production and handling practices. Participatory appraisals were conducted with retailers and the milk value chain mapped. A fault tree was developed and exposure assessment was then qualitatively assessed. Based on this critical control points were identified. RESULTS: Results showed health indicators suggestive of listeriosis in the study area, such as high prevalence of spontaneous abortion, meningitis and diarrhoea in people. Participatory appraisal showed multiple stakeholders whose activities could contribute to the risk of microbial infection, including listeriosis. The important stakeholders are the farmers who do the milking, the assemblers, and the retailers. Value chain mapping found milk from urban, periurban and <b>milkshed</b> producers all flowed to assemblers and from thence by a variety of paths to consumers. The fault-tree generated suggested that infection with L. monocytogenes could result from consuming unpasteurized raw milk contaminated through sources such as cattle, serving and transport utensils, as well as cross-contamination during handling. The results suggest that the highest level of exposure is associated with milk consumed in the retail market and identified the handling practices that might lead to this. (This result was confirmed by a quantitative analysis). Exposure to the pathogen was higher from fermented unpasteurized raw milk retailed on the informal market than boiled raw milk. Boiling could be used to reduce the occurrence of the pathogen in the raw milk samples. SUMMARY: Listeriosis is much under-researched in Africa and this study represents one of the first attempts to understand its importance in Ghana. This study combining health surveys, participatory appraisals, value chain mapping and qualitative risk assessment increased understanding of the risk of listeriosis and suggested critical control points where risk could be mitigated.

40|$|Herd level {{cross-sectional}} and calf level longitudinal {{observational study}} was conducted between November 2014 to April 2015 in peri-urban and urban dairy farms of Bahir Dar milk-shed, Ethiopia. The aims {{of this study were}} therefore, to determine the incidence rate of calf morbidity and mortality, investigating potential determinant factors of calf morbidity and mortality and to determine the passive transfer of immunity in some selected dairy calves. Both concurrent and prospective cohorts were employed to recruit calves aged below 6 month in the study herds. A total of 440 calves, a random sample of 322 calves from small-holder and 118 from five large dairy farms located in Bahir Dar <b>milkshed</b> were included in the study. Each study calf was individually ear -tagged and regularly monitored in monthly basis for clinical health problems up to an age of six months. Information on different potential risk factors was collected by using herd and calf level recording sheets and personal observations. Serum samples were taken from some study calves to determine their level of passive transfer and it was conducted in Bahir Dar Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Laboratory. The overall incidences of crude morbidity and crude mortality rates found in this study were 47. 3 % and 17. 9 %, respectively. Calf diarrhea, pneumonia, navel ill, septicemic conditions, Lumpy Skin Disease, rabies, congenital problems and other miscellaneous cases were encountered during this study. The most frequent disease condition was calf diarrhea with the incidence rate of 25. 2 % followed by pneumonia (8. 6 %). The incidence of crude mortality was apparently higher in large sized dairy farms than smallholder farms. However, calf diarrhea and crude morbidity rates were higher in the latter. About six, 6, 4 and 2 explanatory variables were found significantly associated with crude mortality, crude morbidity, diarrhea and pneumonia respectively by multivariate Cox - regression at P< 0. 05. Older calves above three months age were at lower risk (HR= 0. 03, P= 0. 000) of mortality than younger calves of below three month. The relative hazard (HR= 0. 15, P= 0. 000) of mortality in good vigored calves was lower than that of calves with poor vigor at birth. Those calves fed complete colostrum were found at lower risk (HR= 4. 64, P= 0. 000) of mortality than those fed partial colostrum. Birth type (twin vs. single), method of colostrum feeding and farming system were also the other risk factors determining calf mortality. Likewise, older calves were found at lower risk of crude morbidity (H= 0. 45, P= 0. 000) than younger calves. The hazard of morbidity in those good vigored calves at birth was lower (HR= 0. 26, P= 0. 000) than calves with history of poor vigor. Furthermore, dam age, dam birth related disorders and study location were also found additional risk factors of crude calf morbidity. The relative hazard of diarrhea in crossbred calves (HR= 2. 63, P= 0. 016) was higher than that of local counter parts. Those good vigored calves at birth were also found at lower risk (HR= 0. 24, P= 0. 000) of diarrhea than that of poor vigored counter parts. Furthermore, calf age and study location were found to be additional risk factors of calf diarrhea. Those calves with previous treatment history were at greater risk (HR= 0. 076, P= 0. 000) for pneumonia than calves which did not receive any previous medical treatment. Moreover, vigor status at birth (HR= 0. 24, P= 0. 000) was found significantly associated with calf pneumonia. Out of 46 calves examined by Zinc sulfate (ZnSo 4. 7 H 20) turbidity test, about 8. 7 % of them were found with no detectable colostral Ig (FPT), the remaining 34. 8 % and 56. 5 % were found with adequate and partial protection levels, respectively. Generally, 65. 2 % of calves were found immunologically unprotected in the study herds. In conclusion, the incidence of calf morbidity and mortality found in this study were high and above economically tolerable level. This record therefore, could affect the productivity of the dairy farms through mainly decreasing the availability of replacement stock. Among the significant risk factors investigated, calf vigor, age, breed, dam age and amount of colostrum ingestion were found very important determinant factors of calf mortality and morbidity under the context of small-holder farming system in Bahir Dar milk-shed. A sound dairy calf management practice, is therefore needs understanding and manipulating of the above mentioned calf health determinant factors with subsequent application of tailor-made interventions.
