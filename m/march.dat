5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Cyclone Bola quickly weakened as it accelerated southeastward {{toward a}} frontal trough. On <b>March</b> 3, its winds dropped below hurricane-force, and it gradually lost its tropical characteristics.

It turned southward on <b>March</b> 9, and on <b>March</b> 12 was absorbed by a stationary trough in the Westerlies near the western coast of the South Island.|$|E
