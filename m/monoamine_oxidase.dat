5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitor, a {{few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E

40|$|<b>Monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> {{catalyze}} the oxidative deamination {{of dietary}} amines and amine neurotransmitters, and assist {{in maintaining the}} homeostasis of the amine neurotransmitters in the brain. Dysfunctions of these enzymes can cause neurological and behavioral disorders including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. To understand their physiological roles, efficient assay methods for <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> are essential. Reviewed in this Perspective are the recent progress {{in the development of}} fluorescent probes for <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> and their applications to enzyme assays in cells and tissues. It is evident that still there is strong need for a fluorescent probe with desirable substrate selectivity and photophysical properties to challenge the much unsolved issues associated with the enzymes and the diseases...|$|R
50|$|They {{constitute}} {{the majority of}} enzymes classified under EC number 1.4, {{with most of the}} remainder being <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
50|$|As with PEA, NMPEA is metabolized {{relatively}} rapidly by <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> during {{first pass}} metabolism; both compounds are preferentially metabolized by MAO-B.|$|R
50|$|Catecholamines have a {{half-life}} of a {{few minutes}} when circulating in the blood. They can be degraded either by methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferases (COMT) or by deamination by <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> (MAO).|$|R
40|$|<b>Monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> (EC 1. 4. 3. 4; MAOs), {{a family}} of FAD-containing enzymes, is an {{important}} target for antidepressant drugs. In this paper, a series of 2 -phenoxyacetamide analogues were synthesized, and their inhibitory potency towards <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B) were evaluated using enzyme and cancer cell lysate. 2 -(4 -Methoxyphenoxy) acetamide (compound 12) (SI = 245) and (2 -(4 -((prop- 2 -ynylimino) methyl) phenoxy) acetamide (compound 21) (IC 50 MAO-A = 0. 018 μM, IC 50 MAO-B = 0. 07 μM) were successfully identified as the most specific MAO-A inhibitor, and the most potent MAO-A/-B inhibitor, respectively. The inhibitory activities of these two compounds in living cells were also further evaluated utilizing HepG 2 and SHSY- 5 Y cell lysates...|$|R
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should}} not be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
25|$|Studies of the {{metabolism}} of synephrine by <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> {{derived from}} rat brain mitochondria showed that synephrine was a substrate for deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B, with Km = 250 μM and Vmax = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; {{there was some}} evidence for preferential deamination by MAO-A.|$|R
40|$|Amitraz is an {{important}} product for the control of cattle ticks around the world. In comparison with other products for the control of ticks, it is quite affordable {{and it has a}} rapid knock-down effect. It binds with and activates adrenergic neuro-receptors of animals and it inhibits the action of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> (MAO). Resistance to amitraz has been documented in Rhipicephalus microplus, R. decoloratus and R. appendiculatus. Four mechanisms of resistance have been proposed, each of which is supported by evidence but none of which has been definitively confirmed as the cause of resistance in the field. The proposed mechanisms include genetic target site insensitivity in two G protein-coupled receptors, the beta-adrenergic octopamine receptor (BAOR) and the octopamine/tyramine receptor (OCT/Tyr), increased expression or activity of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> and increased expression or activity of the ATP binding cassette transporter...|$|R
50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} amitraz includes different mechanisms of action leading to toxic effects in humans {{as well as}} in animals.Many of these effects and most of the effects on humans are caused by its alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. Furthermore, amitraz inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, interacts with the octopamine receptors of the central nervous system and inhibits <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases.</b>|$|R
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
40|$|Benzazoles {{containing}} two {{or three}} nitrogen atoms were screened for their inhibitory activity toward <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> MAO-A and MAO-B. In order to clarify the mechanism of interaction of these compounds with the enzyme, their electronic structure was calculated at the ab initio level {{and the influence of}} lipophilicity on activity was investigated. The mode of binding of benzazoles to MAO-B appears different from that of previously investigated heterocycles...|$|R
40|$|Blood-brain barrier {{transport}} of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and antidepressant, citalopram, was studied using monolayers of bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMECs). This study {{provides for the}} first time, evidence of a transport mechanism for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Carrier-mediated transport, efflux mechanisms, as well as inhibition of metabolizing enzymes of citalopram were investigated. Citalopram transport was saturable and temperature-dependent suggesting that passage of the drug across BMECs was mediated by a carrier mechanism. Since the apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical permeability coefficients were similar and cyclosporin A, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, does not modify the {{transport of}} citalopram, it appeared that no active efflux systems were involved in this transport. Citalopram is only available as a racemic drug and its pharmacological effect resides mainly in the S-(+) -enantiomer. However, the passage of citalopram enantiomers across BMEC monolayers was not stereoselective. Finally, inhibition of the metabolizing enzymes of citalopram and <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> did not modify the permeation of citalopram across BMECs. Collectively, our results suggested that citalopram crosses the blood-brain barrier via a non-stereoselective, bidirectional and symmetrical carrier-mediated mechanism without influences of active efflux mechanisms or <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases...</b>|$|R
40|$|The binding of {{zonisamide}} to purified, recombinant <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> (MAOs) {{has been}} investigated. It is a competitive inhibitor of human MAO B (Ki = 3. 1 ± 0. 3 μM), of rat MAO B (Ki = 2. 9 ± 0. 5 μM), and of zebrafish MAO (Ki = 30. 8 ± 5. 3 μM). No inhibition is observed with purified human or rat MAO A. The 1. 8 Å {{structure of the}} MAO B complex demonstrates that it binds within the substrate cavity...|$|R
5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane, which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase,</b> rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} classes of antidepressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitors (MAOIs), reversible inhibitors of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> A (RIMAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSAs).

In particular, 4 b, 5 b, and 4 c showed a K(i-MAO-A) of 0. 6, 0. 8, and 1 nM, respectively, 4 c being 200000 -fold selective for MAO-A with respect to MAO-B...|$|R
40|$|Pyrrolylethanoneamines 1 - 12, 18 - 23 {{and related}} amino {{alcohols}} 13 - 15, 24 - 27 were synthesized and tested against <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B) enzymes. In general, aminoketones 1 - 12, 18 - 23 {{were found to}} be potent and selective MAO-A inhibitors. In particular, 18 was more potent and selective against the MAO-A isoenzyme than reference drugs.

40|$|Neuroinflammation {{is thought}} to play {{a pivotal role in}} many {{diseases}} affecting the brain, including Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke. Neuroinflammation is characterised predominantly by microglial activation, which can be visualised using positron emission tomography (PET). Traditionally, translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is the target for imaging of neuroinflammation using PET. In this review, recent preclinical and clinical research using PET in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke is summarised. In addition, new molecular targets for imaging of neuroinflammation, such as <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases,</b> adenosine receptors and cannabinoid receptor type 2, are discussed...|$|R

25|$|DMT is {{generally}} not active orally unless it is combined with a <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> inhibitor (MAOI) such as a reversible inhibitor of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> A (RIMA), for example, harmaline. Without an MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes orally administered DMT, and it therefore has no hallucinogenic effect unless the dose exceeds monoamine oxidase's metabolic capacity. Other means of ingestion such as vaporizing, injecting, or insufflating the drug can produce powerful hallucinations {{for a short time}} (usually less than half an hour), as the DMT reaches the brain before it can be metabolized by the body's natural <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase.</b> Taking a MAOI prior to vaporizing or injecting DMT prolongs and potentiates the effects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{lines of}} {{evidence}} have been accumulating indicating {{that an important}} role may be played by mitochondrial homeostasis in the initiation phase, {{the first stage of}} apoptosis. This work describes the results obtained by using different inhibitors of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> (MAO), i. e. pargyline, clorgyline and deprenyl, on mitochondrial integrity and apoptosis. Both pargyline and clorgyline are capable of protecting cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation while deprenyl is ineffective. These data represent the first demonstration that MAO-A inhibitors may protect cells from apoptosis through a mechanism involving the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis...|$|R
