25|$|In 1931, the {{dictator}} general Jorge Ubico came to power, {{backed by the}} United States, and initiated {{one of the most}} brutally repressive governments in Central American history. Just as Estrada Cabrera had done during his government, Ubico created a widespread network of spies and informants and had large numbers of political opponents tortured and put to death. A wealthy aristocrat (with an estimated income of $215,000 per year in 1930s dollars) and a staunch anti-communist, he consistently sided with the United Fruit Company, Guatemalan landowners and urban elites in disputes with peasants. After the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, the peasant system established by Barrios in 1875 to jumpstart coffee production in the country was not good enough anymore, and Ubico was forced to implement a system of debt slavery and forced labor to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was enough labor available for the coffee plantations and that the UFCO workers were readily available.|$|E
25|$|Constantius died in 421, {{after only}} seven months as Augustus. He had been careful to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no {{successor}} in waiting, {{and his own}} children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court {{and the death of}} Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, {{at the head of a}} substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of magister militum.|$|E

An impatient Hitler appointed a German, Josef Terboven, as the new Norwegian Reichskommissar, or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no room in the government for the Nasjonal Samling nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along. Terboven eventually accepted a certain Nasjonal Samling presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the Nasjonal Samling and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany. Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral Erich Raeder, whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned [...] "in triumph," [...] having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The Reichskommissar would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the Nasjonal Samling and bring more of his men into the cabinet. Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the Nasjonal Samling would be the only political party allowed.|$|E

After meeting up {{with the rest of the}} UVF bombing team at the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the northern outskirts of Dublin, Hanna activated the bombs and then, along with Jackson, placed them into the three allocated cars' boots.

The Split Radix FFT (SRFFT) is one of the very many algorithms to compute FFT. In this paper, we propose a completely asynchronous design of the split-radix FFT processor core with absolutely no glitches at the output. It reduces the system latency drastically. The asynchronous design <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no separate data load stage in the processor. The reading of the output and the loading of the new inputs can be done simultaneously. This helps to improve the speed of the device. Further, we present an algorithm {{to reduce the number of}} ROMs to store the twiddle factors...|$|R
2500|$|From the {{beginnings}} of {{his work on the}} Mackinac Bridge, Stewart Woodfill was impressed with Steinman's ethical procedure in addressing his requests. In 1950 new legislation was produced stating [...] "the board of engineers retained by the Mackinac Bridge Authority was to be selected and nominated by the Dean of Engineering at the University of Michigan" [...] (Ratigan 280). This was to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no political influence it this decision. Steinman was selected {{to be a member of}} the board. Steinman who had been trained since he was young to work well in groups was chosen as the spokesman for the board. When it comes to speaking in front of large audiences Steinman does it naturally. It was said that Steinman spoke [...] "as comfortable before large audiences as he was on tall bridges" [...] (Petroski 332). The stresses of the early stages of the bridge soon took their toll on Steinman. He had heart attacks in 1952, which was the same year that legislation approved the financing and construction of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Durdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he {{witnessed}} {{the crime and}} knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with [...] "A Man Could Go Quite Mad", to admit his or her culpability; the gist {{of each of these}} songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill Jasper, not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood {{for a while and then}} given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a twist).|$|E

40|$|It is {{critical}} for a numerical scheme to obtain numerical results {{as accurate as possible}} with limited computational resources. Turbulent processes are very sensitive to numerical dissipation, which may dissipate the small length scales. On the other hand, dealing with shock waves, capturing and reproducing of the discontinuity may lead to non-physical oscillations for non-dissipative schemes. In the present work, a new high-order modified weighted compact (MWCS) is proposed for accurate approximation of the derivatives in the governing Euler equations. The basic idea is to add the weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme (WENO) to weighted compact scheme to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the scheme is diagonally dominant, and then add some WENO in additional to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> some dissipation in the smooth area to avoid oscillations.
