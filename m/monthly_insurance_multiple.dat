40|$|Background/AimsThe Korean {{government}} has expanded {{the coverage of}} the national insurance scheme for four major diseases: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and rare diseases. This policy may have a detrimental effect on the budget of the national health insurance agency. Like taxes, national insurance premiums are levied {{on the basis of the}} income or wealth of the insured. MethodsUsing a preference elicitation method, we attempted to estimate how much people are willing to pay for insurance premiums that would expand their coverage for liver cancer treatment. ResultsWe calculated the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) through the marginal rate of substitution between the two attributes of the insurance premium and the total annual treatment cost by adopting conditional logit and mixed logit models. ConclusionsThe effects of various other terms that could interact with socioeconomic status were also estimated, such as gender, income level, educational attainment, age, employment status, and marital status. The estimated MWTP values of the <b>monthly</b> <b>insurance</b> premium for liver cancer treatment range from 4, 130 KRW to 9, 090 KRW...|$|R
50|$|When we {{talk about}} {{canceling}} the FHA insurance, we talk only about the MMI part of it. Unlike other forms of conventional financed mortgage insurance, the UFMIP on an FHA loan is prorated over a three-year period, meaning should the homeowner refinance or sell {{during the first three}} years of the loan, they are entitled to a partial refund of the UFMIP paid at loan inception. If you have financed the UFMIP into the loan, you cannot cancel this part. The insurance premiums on a 30-year FHA loan which began before 6/3/2013 must have been paid for at least 5 years. The MMI premium gets terminated automatically once the unpaid principal balance, excluding the upfront premium, reaches 78% of the lower of the initial sales price or appraised value. After 6/3/2013 for both 30 and 15-year loan term, the <b>monthly</b> <b>insurance</b> premium must be paid for 11 years if the initial loan to value was 90% or less. For loan to value greater than 90% the insurance premium must now be paid for the entire loan term.|$|R

40|$|Medical {{expenses}} {{are one of}} the most important risks that American households face today. For almost 6 % of U. S. families, for example, there is a more than a $ 5, 000 increase in medical spending from one year to the next. As a result, most Americans insure their medical spending. Eighty-four percent of the U. S. population has health insurance, either from private or public sources. 1 Health insurance plans have several common features. Individuals, or someone on their behalf (such as employers or the government), pay <b>monthly</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums, in return for which the insurance entity pays for some share of their medical costs. The share that is not paid by the insurer is the patient’s “co-insurance ” amount, and is borne by the individual. A central question for designing health insurance plans is: how large should such a co-insurance amount be? This question has been an important source of debate among both academics and health policy-makers. There is a clear tradeoff as patient co-insurance amounts rise. On the one hand, co-insurance can induce patients to use care more efficiently. With no co-insurance costs, patients have no financial disincentive to forgo care, even if it is of dubious value; but once patients bea...|$|R
40|$|The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 {{requires}} {{states to}} establish healthcare insurance exchanges by 2014 {{to facilitate the}} purchase of qualified health plans. States are required to establish exchanges for small businesses and individuals. A federally operated exchange will be established, and states failing to participate in any other exchanges will be mandated to join the federal exchange. Policymakers and health economists believe that exchanges will improve healthcare at lower cost by promoting competition among insurers and by reducing burdensome transaction costs. Consumers {{will no longer be}} isolated from <b>monthly</b> <b>insurance</b> premium costs. Exchanges will increase the number of patients insured with more cost-conscious managed care and high-deductible plans. These insurance plan models have historically undervalued emergency medical services, while also underinsuring patients and limiting their healthcare system access to the emergency department. This paradoxically increases demand for emergency services while decreasing supply. The continual devaluation of emergency medical services by insurance payers will result in inadequate distribution of resources to emergency care, resulting in further emergency department closures, increases in emergency department crowding, and the demise of acute care services provided to families and communities.
