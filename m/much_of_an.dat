5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept {{his place in the}} Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi {{lights were}} again tried, this time mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, {{this time with}} thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aircraft's surface.|$|E
5|$|In 59BC, when he {{was four}} years old, his father died. His mother married a former {{governor}} of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56BC. Philippus never had <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effort.|$|E
5|$|Pitfour was {{described}} {{as one of the}} greatest lawyers in the country. However, by the time he became a Senator of the College of Justice he was past his prime intellectually and thus did not make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact in that role. A Jacobite sympathiser, he is best known for his defence of rebels standing trial at Carlisle after the Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent.

5|$|The games {{received}} critical acclaim, obtaining {{an aggregate}} score of 81percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised {{the fact that}} the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improvement over the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12million copies worldwide.|$|E

The Gamecocks were not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opponent, as the ladies more than doubled their points at the half (53–26), and finished the game 94–52. This game was followed up with another highly ranked opponent, the twelfth-ranked Gators. Once again, the Vols ran a talented team into the ground, as they only allowed 18 first half points, ultimately winning by a score of 99–60.|$|E

5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo fixed on the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received rave reviews for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, feeling that she was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw her show again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actress.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E

5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
