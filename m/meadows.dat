5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water <b>meadows.</b> Farming of the water <b>meadows</b> continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the <b>meadows,</b> with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the <b>meadows</b> are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass <b>meadows</b> and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass <b>meadows,</b> while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass <b>meadows.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while <b>Meadows</b> investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. <b>Meadows</b> uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. <b>Meadows</b> also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E

5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, <b>meadows</b> provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many <b>meadows.</b> Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E

40|$|We {{quantified}} how {{rates of}} stream channel migration in a montane <b>meadow</b> vary {{as a function}} of the riparian vegetation community. The South Fork of the Kern River at Monache <b>Meadow,</b> located in California’s southern Sierra Nevada range, supports two distinct types of vegetation: a dry <b>meadow</b> community dominated by sagebrush and non-native grasses (xeric scrub and <b>meadow),</b> and a wet <b>meadow</b> community dominated by rushes and sedges (hydric graminoids). We measured rates of lateral stream migration for dry versus wet <b>meadow</b> reaches from aerial photographs spanning a 40 -year period (1955 – 1995). While stream migration rates averaged only 0 Ð 24 š 0 Ð 02 m a 1 in the wet <b>meadow,</b> the dry <b>meadow</b> channel migrated an average of 1 Ð 4 š 0 Ð 3 m a 1. We used a linear model of meander migration to calculate coefficients that characterize bank migration potential, or bank erodibility, independent of channel curvature. These calculations demonstrate that, at Monache <b>Meadow,</b> banks without wet <b>meadow</b> vegetation are roughly ten times more susceptible to erosion than banks with wet <b>meadow</b> vegetation. Where stream bank heights consistently exceed 1 m, low water availability creates riparian habitats dominated by dry <b>meadow</b> vegetation. Thus, channel incision may reduce bank stability not only by increasing bank height, but also by converting banks from wet <b>meadow</b> to dry meado...|$|R

5|$|NY240 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY242 {{in the town}} of Ellicottville along the western leg of a railroad wye near Beaver <b>Meadows</b> Creek. NY240 proceeds northward alongside Beaver <b>Meadows</b> Creek co-designated as County Route32 (CR32; West Valley Road). The routes proceed northward through Ellicottville as a two-lane roadway through dense forestry, bending northward along the creek and a nearby railroad track. The dense forestry remains for several miles, before bending northeast into an intersection with Fancy Tract Road. NY240 and CR32 continue northeast as the dense woods retreat for residences before bending northwest away from Beaver <b>Meadows</b> Creek. After bending northward once more, the routes cross through large fields and past several houses along West Valley Road.|$|E
5|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1960s by Norwegian {{explorer}} Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse settlement located at {{the northern tip of}} Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L'Anse aux <b>Meadows,</b> is Leif's settlement of Leifsbúðir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L'Anse aux <b>Meadows</b> site was a ship repair station and waypoint for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L'Anse aux <b>Meadows</b> with Leifsbúðir since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The Saga of Erik the Red mentions two other settlements in Vinland: a settlement called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.|$|E
