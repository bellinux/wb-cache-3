50|$|Most diferulic acids are not commercially {{available}} {{and must be}} synthesised in lab. Synthetic routes have been published, but it is often simpler to extract them from plant material. They can be extracted from plant cell walls (often <b>maize</b> <b>bran)</b> by concentrated solutions of alkali, the resulting solution is then acidified and phase separated into an organic solvent. The resulting solution is evaporated to give a mixture of ferulic acid moieties that can be separated by column chromatography. Identification is often by high performance liquid chromatography with a UV detector or by LC-MS. Alternatively they can be derivatised to make them volatile and therefore suitable for GC-MS.

Flours, brans and germs from various cereals, flakes and extruded cereals were chosen as samples. Phenolic substances were analyzed by spectrophotometry, RP-HPLC/UV-VIS and RP-HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS. Studies of saccharide content which were analyzed by spectrophotometry and HPLC/RI was incorporated to this thesis. Differences {{in the content of}} phenolic substances released from glycosides after acid hydrolysis of samples and differences in saccharide content determined after acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of samples were investigated.

The quantity of phenolic substances increased for several times in samples processed by acid hydrolysis in comparison to non-hydrolyzed samples. The high content of total saccharides, reduced saccharides and individual mono- and disaccharides was found mainly in extruded products. Concentration of monosaccharides increased in acid hydrolyzed samples in spite of disaccharides concentration that was higher only in some of hydrolyzed samples.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the world population, high cost of conventional animal feed ingredients and low protein intake in most developing countries has necessitated animal scientists to search for alternative sources of feed ingredients. This can enhance the production of animals with short generation intervals such as poultry to overcome the protein deficiency.

Results obtained from various sources indicate that diets formulated with alternative cereal grains and cereal by-products had no adverse effects on body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio and carcass quality of broiler chickens, cockerels and egg quality of laying hens. Inclusion of different levels of brewers’ dried grain, <b>maize</b> offal, rice <b>bran</b> and broken rice are quite acceptable in poultry diets.

Moreover, <b>maize</b> <b>bran</b> contains hemicellulose, cellulose and a small amount of lignin, thus representing a source of dietary fiber. The hemicellulosic fraction, generally denominated arabinoxylans (AX), has a particular heterogeneous nature, with extensive cross-linkages between ferulic acid and arabinose/xylose heteropolisaccharides. This particular feature promoted a complex and rigid structure of maize cell wall (Rose et al. 2010).

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{interest}} in healthy and qualitative food, there is an increasing interest in dietary fiber. In Europe, the average daily intake of fiber lies beneath the recommended intake. In this context, bran {{may be part of}} the solution because it is one of the most concentrated sources of dietary fiber. The objective of this study is to examine the differences in chemical composition, physical characteristics and structure of wheat-, rye-, oat- and <b>maize</b> <b>bran.</b> This information is important in the context of understanding the physiological effects of bran consumption. Commercial bran contains residual endosperm that interferes with the characterization of the botanical bran. Therefore, methods were developed to reduce the endosperm contamination with a minimal loss of non-endosperm material. The starch content of wheat bran was drastically reduced (from 24 % to 2 %) and a clear reduction in starch content was also obtained for rye bran (from 45 % to 7 %), oat bran (from 57 % to 13 %) and <b>maize</b> <b>bran</b> (from 62 % to 2 %). Chemical characterization was performed, showing large differences in composition between bran of different cereals. Oat bran had the highest beta-glucan content (17 %). <b>Maize</b> <b>bran</b> was characterized by a high arabinoxylan content (43 %) and a low mineral content (1 %). Rye bran contained more water-soluble compounds, mainly fructan (7. 5 %) and water extractable arabinoxylan (1. 3 %), than wheat bran (3. 4 % and 0. 6 %, respectively). The bran samples furthermore differed in physical characteristics. Oat bran had the highest capacity to strongly bind water (1. 7 g/g dry bran) compared to wheat bran (0. 8 g), rye bran (0. 8 g) and <b>maize</b> <b>bran</b> (0. 9 g). Moreover, when an extract was made of the different bran samples, the oat bran extract was the most viscous. Furthermore, the water extractable content of rye (35 %) and oat bran (31 %) was higher compared to wheat (24 %) and <b>maize</b> <b>bran</b> (13 %). Also bran morphology, which was examined using cryo-SEM microscopy, was highly cereal dependent. It can be concluded that the chemical composition, the physical characteristics and the structure of wheat, rye, oat and <b>maize</b> <b>bran</b> differ markedly.

Nineteen feed ingredients (brans, vegetable proteins, and grains) were evaluated for their potential to generate methane and change methanogen diversity using an in vitro ruminal fermentation technique.

Methanogen diversity among low, medium and high-methane producing groups was analyzed by PCR-DGGE. The highest methane production was observed in Korean wheat bran, soybean and perilla meals, and wheat and <b>maize</b> of <b>brans,</b> vegetable protein and cereal groups, respectively.

Prior to extraction of F-AXOS, samples were subjected to either simulated gastric fluid with enzymes (gastric) or without enzymes (pH) or water (aqueous) at 37 °C. F-AXOS present in all samples were identified as 5 -O-feruloyl-α-L- arabinofuranose and possibly 5 -O-feruloyl-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3) -O-β-D-xylopyranose. Their mean content, measured as esterified ferulic acid (FA), was 2. 5 times higher in maize (10. 33 ± 2. 40 μg/g) compared to wheat.

The results showed that the rate of excretion of EEL (32. 71 % for Cornish and 17. 82 % for RIR) and nitrogen (40. 26 % for Cornish and 22. 80 % for RIR) voided by adult birds of two strains decreases during the period of fasting bird (12 to 72 h). The effect of fasting period (12, 24, 48 and 72 h) on the TME values obtained of barley, wheat and maize 18. 98, 6. 24 and 16. 32 % for Cornish and 12. 78, 7. 82 and 8. 31 % for RIR birds, were significantly due to be reduced respectively. The finding of this study proves those 48 h fasting birds of two strains are suitable for routine of excreta collection time on estimates of metabolic plus endogenous energy losses for true metabolisable energy values for cereals such as wheat, wheat <b>bran,</b> <b>maize</b> and barley...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to apply the Vitti-Dias model to investigate phosphorus (P) metabolism in growing pigs fed a diet supplemented with microbial phytase. The basal diet contained <b>maize,</b> defatted rice <b>bran,</b> vegetable oil, soybean meal, limestone, salt and a vitamin and mineral mix. There was no inorganic P in the diet and phytase was added at levels of 253, 759, 1265 and 1748 phytase units (PU) /kg of feed. The compartmental model included four pools of P: (I) gut lumen, (2) plasma, (3) bone and (4) soft tissue. A single dose of (32) P was administered, and specific radioactivity was measured in plasma, faeces, bone and soft tissue (muscle, heart, liver and kidney) at different times post-dosing for calculation of P flows between pools. Total P absorbed showed a negative relationship with total P excreted in faeces and Was strongly correlated with bone P retention, suggesting that absorbed P was channelled to bone to address its physiological growth. Average efficiency of metabolic utilization of absorbed P was estimated to be 0. 94, with 0. 52 g/g of total net P balance being accreted in bone and the rest in soft tissue (including muscle and some vital organs). The Vitti-Dias model provided suitable representation of P interchange between compartments (in particular, flows between gut and plasma and partitioning of available P between bone and soft tissue), resulting in estimates of P flows comparable with values calculated from balance data.
