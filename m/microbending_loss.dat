40|$|Microbending plays a {{key role}} in the bend loss of optical fibres. To numerically {{investigate}} microbending induced loss, an analytical model for microbending in optical fibres with arbitrary refractive index profiles is presented. In this model, random perturbations of the fibre core along the fibre axis are described by an analytical function whose power spectral density is derived from an exponential autocorrelation function. Using the model together with the beam propagation method, <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> is investigated for several different types of optical fibre, which include the traditional single-mode/multimode fibres (SMF/MMF) as used in existing optical networks, and typical few-mode/ring-core fibres (FMF/RCF) with the potential for future ultra high-speed optical networks. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing the <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> of a SMF computed using coupled mode theory and our results. Simulation results show that, under the condition of launching only the fundamental mode into the optical fibres, the SMF and RCF supporting only one radial mode have nearly equal <b>microbending</b> <b>loss,</b> whilst the FMF and MMF have relatively low <b>microbending</b> <b>loss.</b> In addition, the <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> of the RCF is shown to be dependent on the ring core thickness...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pseudo-random}} transverse microscopic corrugations on the amplitude attenuation {{of the fundamental}} hybrid mode in curved graded-index monomode fibres is investigated. For {{the first time in}} the literature, a general formulation of <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> in local toroidal co-ordinates is presented. The formulation does not, in any way, depend on the existence of a large number of statistically identical and independent monomode fibres of which the given specimen is an ensemble averaged sample. This general formalism is used to derive an expression for the microbending coupling spectrum which encapsulates the essential analytical characteristics of both non-zero polarisation and curvature effects. Theoretical results of the wavelength dependence of excess <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> for two power spectral density functions along with their respective optimised statistical fibre parameters are investigated and show considerable improvement over previous studies...|$|E
40|$|A time {{division}} multiplexing (TDM) array for passive multiplexing of identical fibre, optic intensity sensors has been demonstrated. <b>Microbending</b> <b>loss</b> sensors are introduced in fibre optic rings and pressure information is directly detected, demultiplexed and demodulated from the relative amplitude {{of the first two}} pulses produced on each ring. Several dynamic ranges from 6 dB to 14 dB are shown. A comparison between both fibre optic ring and Mach-Zehnder structure impulse responses is carried out and the consequences derived from second- and higher-order recirculating ring pulses are also evaluated. This technique can be applied to those TDM intensity sensing schemes which require low cost, high number of identical sensors, and suffer high element loss and undersirable intensity fluctuations at low frequencies...|$|E
50|$|This type of double-clad fiber has the {{advantage}} of very low <b>microbending</b> <b>losses.</b> It also has two zero-dispersion points, and low dispersion over a much wider wavelength range than standard singly clad fiber. Since the dispersion of such double-clad fibers can be engineered to a great extent, these fibers can be used for the compensation of chromatic dispersion in optical communications and other applications.|$|R
50|$|Beside {{mechanical}} destruction, {{another reason}} why one should avoid excessive bending of fiber-optic cables is to minimize <b>microbending</b> and macrobending <b>losses.</b> <b>Microbending</b> causes light attenuation induced by deformation of the fiber while macrobending causes the leakage of light through the fiber cladding and this {{is more likely to}} happen where the fiber is excessively bent.|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of highly compact {{photonic}} microbend exploiting whispering gallery propagation is analyzed. Critical design dimensions are relaxed by using multimode waveguiding. A small outer sidewall radius enables tight arbitrary angle of rotation for the guided light, and the inner radius is reduced beyond the caustic radius to minimize {{the impact of the}} <b>microbend</b> dimensions on <b>losses.</b> Whispering gallery operation is compared with single-mode microbend operation using a combination of full-vectorial wave-equation models and 2 -D and 3 -D finite-difference time domain models. The dependence of loss on fabricated dimension is shown to be reduced by an order of magnitude. Waveguide width variations of ± 100 nm lead to loss variations of only ± 0. 01 dB in the whispering gallery regime, contrasting favorably with ± 0. 10 dB loss variations for the single-mode regime for a 20 µm radius and for 1. 5 µm input waveguide widths. Smaller radius microbends show comparable trends albeit with higher losses and increased sensitivity to width variations. The sensitivity of <b>microbend</b> <b>loss</b> to small changes in narrow waveguide width is attributed to the excitation of a restricted mode group. Moving the inner sidewall beyond the caustic radius allows relaxed tolerance light propagation in the whispering gallery regime. Losses down to 0. 2 dB/ 180 ° and polarization conversion of down to - 25 dB/ 180 are predicted...|$|R
40|$|Curvature of a {{single-mode}} {{optical fibre}} {{gives rise to}} two principal forms of additional transmission loss, namely transition loss and pure bend loss. The transition loss and the associated ray radiation, which have been observed {{at the beginning of}} a bend, can be satisfactorily explained by a modified coupled mode theory. The radiation modes are represented by a quasi-guided mode having an average propagation constant beta(e). The introduction of a gradual change of curvature reduces the transition loss much more than the pure bend loss. Analysis of the <b>microbending</b> <b>loss</b> shows that the transition component is a maximum at a given correlation length which can be simply expressed in terms of beta(e). The contributions of both transition and bend components to the total microbend loss have been derived for the case of a randomly-curved fibre for several autocorrelation and density functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} double-coated optical fibers to {{minimize}} hydrostatic-pressure-induced microbending losses caused by creep deformation of polymeric coatings is investigated. The hydrostatic-pressure-induced stresses in optical fibers {{are derived from}} the viscoelastic behavior of commercial polymeric coatings. <b>Microbending</b> <b>loss</b> in these fibers is dominated by compressive radial stress at the interface between the glass fiber and the primary coating, which {{is a function of}} the material properties of the polymeric coatings and their thickness. To minimize these losses in double-coated optical fibers, one should diminish the Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, and relaxation time of the primary coating as well as the strain ratio of the secondary coating, but should raise the strain ratio of the primary coating and the radius, Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, and relaxation time of the secondary coating. The radius of the primary coating possesses an optimum value. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1. 3454386...|$|E
40|$|Landslide {{monitoring}} is {{very important}} in predicting the behavior of landslides, thereby ensuring environment, life, and property safety. On the basis of our previous studies, a novel combined optic fiber transducer (COFT) for landslides monitoring and the related analysis methods are presented. Based on the principles of optical fiber <b>microbending</b> <b>loss,</b> the empirical formula of the shearing displacement of sliding body versus optical loss was established through a stretching test of optical fiber bowknot. Then the COFT grouting direct shearing tests, a large-scale landslide model test, and numerical modeling verification with FLAC 3 D are carried out. According to the results, the initial measurement precision of the designed COFT in sandy clay is 1 [*]mm; its monitoring sliding distance is larger than 26. 5 [*]mm. The calculated values based on empirical formula are in good agreement with the laboratory tests and numerical simulation results. When the ratio of cement and sand in mortar is 1 [*]:[*] 5, the error between the calculated displacement and the measured displacement of sliding surface is the smallest. The COFT with expandable polystyrene (EPS) as its base material performs better in monitoring sandy clay slopes because both the error and the mean square deviation of the empirical formula are smaller...|$|E
40|$|The {{publication}} by Kao and Hockham in 1965 of {{what has}} become accepted as the first serious analysis of the prospects for optical fibre communications had on its first page “Solving the Maxwell equations under the boundary conditions imposed by the physical structure…. ”, followed by the famous expressions for the optical modes in a cylindrical geometry and the observation that the lowest order HE 11 mode in a fibre had no cut-off. Since that time, mode control in optical fibres has been key to optical fibre development, be it limiting the modal diffusion (coupling) in multimode fibres, to minimising bend or <b>microbend</b> <b>losses,</b> or to controlling the ‘modality’ and modal instability in high-power lasers operating at kilowatt levels. The progress of optical fibres is charted over the decades through understanding the guidance conditions set out by Maxwell, or their ‘weakly-guiding’ simplifications. Particular examples are at the two extremes of fibre performance, the 0. 146 dB/km of today’s ULL (ultra-low loss) fibres and the remarkable kWatt power handling ability of large core fibres. The prospects for new air core fibres with very different guidance mechanisms than that analysed by Kao and Hockham will be examined and some predictions for {{the future will be}} made. <br/...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{transition}} from single mode waveguiding through to the whispering gallery regime in open waveguide micro-bends. 2 D FDTD simulations reveal a critical sensitivity of bend loss and waveguiding properties to waveguide width. Vectorial mode-solver analysis identifies a regime of significant and deleterious mode mixing, even for structures operating within the whispering gallery caustic radius. Careful choice in dimensions can however lead to highly fabrication tolerant <b>microbends</b> with a <b>loss</b> variation of order ± 0. 01 dB for a waveguide variation of ± 100 nm...|$|R
40|$|Water sensing systems using {{distributed}} detection techniques {{through which}} {{the presence or absence}} of water may be monitored and located along the length of an optical fibre have numerous potential applications in, for example, district heating systems and the water distribution network. A number of configurations based on silica fibres have been demonstrated in the past but there is understandable user caution since in all these configurations the water needs to be in close contact with the fibre itself. Consequently any minor damage to coatings – and these are typically exposed – allows water seepage to the surface of the silica and consequent vulnerability to catastrophic degradation. In this paper we assess the prospects which a plastic fibre base system may offer as a prospective distributed monitoring system for water and – potentially – for other aqueous parameters such as pH and ionic concentration which could be addressed using different interface detection materials. The principal benefit of plastic optical fibres lies in their ruggedness when exposed to water. The basic principle which we shall exploit is based upon configuring a cable structure in which the parameter to be monitored – here water – causes an interface material to swell. In turn this swelling material forces the optical fibre into contact with a mircobend inducing structure causing detectable optical loss. Varying the swelling material can assist in optimising the response to either particular aqueous solutions and/or to limitations imposed by other parameters such as temperature. Based upon our previous experience with silica fibre we investigated graded index POF as the optical transmission medium and assessed its sensitivity to <b>microbend</b> induced <b>losses,</b> both as a function of the period of the microbend applied and of the amplitude of the peak to peak displacements introduced by the microbender from the mutual axis of the fibre. Full details of these results will be presented in the paper but in summary we found that significantly greater displacements are required for POF and for the silica fibres and consequently the interface swelling material needs to offer significantly greater (by at least an order of magnitude) swelling capability in response to the aqueous trigger than we found with the silica precursor. These observations have significant implications for the design of a sensor system and we have produced a preliminary demonstration which certainly responds to the aqueous trigger but because of the different characteristics of the fibre response the sensor responds much more slowly and in the early configurations also exhibits more hysteresis. However for many applications for which a one off trigger is all that is required the convenience of the POF format and the inherent construction and architecture simplicity offer significant compensating benefits. Again more details will be presented in the final paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} commercial UV-cured polymeric coatings of optical fibers is evaluated using dynamic mechanic analysis. The {{results indicate that}} relaxation of stresses and/or strains in these coatings occurs by creep deformation. The axial strain-induced viscoelastic stresses in optical fibers are derived from the exact viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coatings. Compressive radial stress on the glass fiber produces microbending losses, and therefore, microbending losses in double-coated optical fibers that are caused by axial strain-induced creep deformation of polymeric coatings are investigated. These microbending losses can be minimized by suitably selecting the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coatings, as follows. The radius, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the primary coating should be increased, but the Young's modulus and relaxation time of the primary coating should be decreased. The radius, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the secondary coating should be decreased, but the relaxation time of the secondary coating should be increased. When the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coating are chosen to minimize the <b>microbending</b> <b>loss,</b> the thickness and Young's modulus of the secondary coatings should {{be large enough to}} withstand an external mechanical force.
