5000|$|The Compaq Presario R3000 Line is a Series of laptops {{designed}} and built by Hewlett-Packard Corporation. They could be shipped with Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, ME, or XP. The series used Intel or AMD Processors, could have 256 MB (256 MiB) or 512 MB of RAM (Some of this was reserved for the Graphics Card), and had an ATI Mobility Radeon 9000/9100 IGP (Integrated Graphics Processor) [...] "on board". The sound card was made by Analog Devices, and was also [...] "on board". Some of the ports on the computer are USB, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), Headphone Out, Microphone In, S-Video Out, <b>Monitor</b> <b>Out,</b> and Parallel. It also has a RJ45 Connector (Network cable) and a Phone line jack. One that is special to this series is an Expansion Port for HP's Expansion Dock. This type of port is found in some of HP's other Notebooks. Some models in the series have Broadcom WiFi adapters.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, 4000 and 8000-series PETs used larger {{monitors}} {{and a different}} video controller than the 2001/3000 models. This created a notorious compatibility problem known as the killer poke. On 2001/3000 PETs, there was a register which when enabled did not allow reading/writing of the video RAM except during the vertical blanking {{in order to prevent}} snow on the screen (caused by the CPU and video controller trying to access the VRAM at the same time). Ordinarily, this feature was enabled on power-up. If the user didn't mind snow, he could turn it off and get faster text output. BASIC programs and some machine-language software commonly did this for performance reasons. 4000/8000 PETs used a video controller based on the Motorola 6845 CRTC chip (unlike the TTL logic circuit in 2001/3000s) that eliminated the snow problem, but also placed a CRT control register in place of where the VBLANK flag had been on the 2001/3000. Hence software that tried to disable it would end up throwing the <b>monitor</b> <b>out</b> of sync and destroying the flyback transformer. BASIC programs intended for the 2001/3000 thus had to be modified in order to run safely on the 4000/8000. Later 40xx/80xx PETs had modified video circuitry to prevent killer poke damage; a TDA 1170 chip was used in place of the original analog circuit so that if no sync went to the monitor, it would merely be shut off rather than sent spurious signals. Video RAM on the PET used 1kx4 SRAMs. These consisted of two 6550s (original PET 2001), two 2114s (all later 40 column models), or four 2114s (80 column models).|$|E

In some image editing software this is called [...] "curves", usually a tool found in the color menu, and no reference to [...] "gamma" [...] is used anywhere in the program or the program documentation. Strictly speaking, the curves tool usually does more than simple gamma correction, since one can construct complex curves with multiple inflection points, but when no dedicated gamma correction tool is provided, it can achieve the same effect.|$|R

The work focuses on differences not only among girls and boys, but also among districts of the South Bohemian region. In connection with those data it shows also discrepancy between involvement of children from municipality status cities and childrens from country-side. With the help of data from Czech Statistical Office in České Budějovice it shows the relation between population and number of children attending those movement activity.

40|$|To {{determine}} the physiological effect of {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery and the mechanisms for pain relief, 15 patients with exertional angina were studied before and after operation. Before the operation conventional tests included exercise tests (all positive) and coronary angiography (all patients had {{greater than or equal}} to 70 % stenosis of major vessels). In addition, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during 48 hours detected 92 episodes ({{greater than or equal to}} 1 mm) of ST depression. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed with positron tomography using rubidium- 82 (t 1 / 2 78 s) and this showed reversible inhomogeneity with absolute regional reduction of cation uptake after exercise in all 15 patients. After coronary surgery 10 of the 15 patients had (a) no angina, (b) patent grafts (three or more), (c) no evidence of ischaemia during ambulatory <b>monitoring</b> <b>out</b> of hospital, and (d) homogeneous perfusion with reversal of the disturbances in regional myocardial perfusion after exercise. After operation one of the 15 patients had no angina and showed silent infarction in the segment that was previously ischaemic but supplied by a patent graft. All but one of the remaining patients had no angina, patent grafts, but disturbances of regional myocardial perfusion with silent ischaemia on exercise. Two of these patients continued to have asymptomatic and ischaemic episodes of ST depression during ambulatory <b>monitoring</b> <b>out</b> of hospital. This physiological study of regional myocardial perfusion in patients in hospital and in those with ischaemia out of hospital showed that three different mechanisms may account for the relief of pain [...] improved perfusion, infarction, and silent ischaemia. Silent ischaemia in particular raises puzzling pathophysiological and therapeutic questions that may affect prognosis and the interpretation of clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cross-site {{scripting}} (XSS) vulnerabilities make {{it possible}} for worm to spread quickly to a broad range of users on popular web sites. Today, the detection of XSS worm has been largely UN explored. This paper proposes the first purely client-side solution to detect XSS worms. Our sight is that an XSS worm must spread from one user to another by reconstructing and propagating its payload. Our approach prevents the propagation of XSS worms by <b>monitoring</b> <b>out</b> going request that sends self-replicating pay loads. We intercept all HTTP request on the client side and compare them with currently embedded scripts. We have implemented a cross-platform Firefox extension that is able to detect all existing self-replicating XSS worms that propagate on the client side. Our test results show that it incurs low performance overhead and reports no false positive when tested on popular web-sites...|$|R
