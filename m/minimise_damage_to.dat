25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to <b>minimise</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E
500|$|Ten Tors is {{an annual}} event {{organised}} by the British Army in which groups of young people, {{between the ages of}} 14 and 20, trek a route of 35, 45 or 55 miles (depending on the age of the participant) across Dartmoor. The event started in 1960 with just over 200 teenagers taking part and has grown to include 2,400 teenagers from schools and youth organisations, mostly from the United Kingdom. The number of participants is capped at 2,400—400 groups of six—to <b>minimise</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the environment caused by the event. Participants start from the British Army training camp at Okehampton and are required to carry all their supplies for the trek and spend one night in a tent on the moor. Shaw's group, on a training expedition with dozens of other groups ahead of the main event, was accompanied by a teacher from Edgehill College designated the [...] "team manager". All team managers undergo compulsory training, run by the Army and the Dartmoor Rescue Group, which involves trekking the route themselves.|$|E
500|$|Depots were {{established}} inland {{rather than in}} the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A [...] speed limit was imposed to <b>minimise</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the main road. This was covered with [...] of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some [...] of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] (1064nm wavelength) is {{a common}} choice of laser for working with {{biological}} specimens.

Perhaps the most important consideration in optical tweezer design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{then had}} a slow start to the 1999 World Cup in England.

This would enhance Australia's chances: if the West Indies' run rate remained high, they would qualify ahead of New Zealand.

40|$|Passive {{control devices}} {{are used in}} {{structures}} to dissipate seismic energy with a view <b>to</b> <b>minimise</b> <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the major structural components. A relatively new device, yielding shear panel device (YSPD), to exploit the shear deformation of thin metal plates to absorb energy has recently been developed. YSPD is formed by welding a thin steel plate within a steel square hollow section (SHS) and its behaviour is determined by complex interactions among the thin diaphragm plate, the surrounding SHS and the boundary conditions. Available experimental results show that YSPD produces nonlinear pinching hysteretic force-displacement response when subjected to cyclic loading. This paper proposes a mathematical model to predict the hysteretic response using easily available parameters, i. e. the geometry of the YSPD and {{the properties of the}} material. Results obtained from the verified finite element (FE) models are used to calibrate the proposed models, which should facilitate the full scale modelling of building frames retrofitted with YSPD...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} an {{important}} local cytotoxic modality for cancer treatment whose aim is to control the disease while <b>minimising</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> normal tissue. The combination of different treatment modalities offers a more effective cure and reduction in normal tissue toxicity. However, the differences in genetic profiles can cause diverse treatment outcomes. Multidisciplinary research, where technologies and knowledge from different areas are integrated, is necessary to design the optimal regimen for individualised cancer treatment. This paper offers an overview of some new cancer treatment strategies; the impact of molecular imaging on radiation oncology; and a computer simulation model to optimise treatment planning based on patient information. It briefly discusses molecular targeted therapy, tumour microenvironment and bioreductive agents, and evidence for making individualised medicine a reality. Using DNA microarrays and proteomic technologies, information on defined molecular targets and genetic profiling for individual patients can be obtained and new algorithms for radiation oncology-related diagnosis, treatment response and prognosis can be developed. © 2006 Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal.
