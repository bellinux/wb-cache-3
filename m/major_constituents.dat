5|$|Lithium fluoride, when {{highly enriched}} in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic {{constituent}} of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have low melting points. In addition, 7Li, Be, and F {{are among the}} few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.Be and 19F respectively. These two, together with 7Li, as well as 2H, 11B, 15N, 209Bi, and the stable isotopes of C, and O, are the only nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross sections aside from actinides to serve as <b>major</b> <b>constituents</b> of a molten salt breeder reactor fuel.|$|E

It is used to create artificial pores {{in the manufacture of}} high-porosity grinding wheels. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene and its alkyl homologs are the <b>major</b> <b>constituents</b> of creosote. Naphthalene is used in engineering to study heat transfer using mass sublimation.|$|E
25|$|The {{mineralogy}} of VMS massive sulfide {{consists of}} over 90% iron sulfide, {{mainly in the}} form of pyrite, with chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena also being <b>major</b> <b>constituents.</b> Magnetite is present in minor amounts; as magnetite content increases, the ores grade into massive oxide deposits. The gangue (the uneconomic waste material) is mainly quartz and pyrite or pyrrhotite. Due to the high density of the deposits some have marked gravity anomalies (Neves-Corvo, Portugal) which is of use in exploration.|$|E
25|$|Microtubules {{are very}} {{important}} {{in a number of}} cellular processes. They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, they form the cytoskeleton. They also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella.They provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the movement of secretory vesicles, organelles, and intracellular macromolecular assemblies (see entries for dynein and kinesin). They are also involved in chromosome separation (mitosis and meiosis), and are the <b>major</b> <b>constituents</b> of mitotic spindles, which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|In plants, {{the solid}} {{long-chain}} alkanes {{are found in}} the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species, but are only rarely <b>major</b> <b>constituents.</b> They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.|$|E
25|$|Careful Fourier data {{analysis}} over a nineteen-year period (the National Tidal Datum Epoch in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the tidal harmonic constituents. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, moon and sun's relative positions repeat almost {{exactly in the}} Metonic cycle of 19years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal tidal constituent. This analysis can be done using only {{the knowledge of the}} forcing period, but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries. The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12hours (the semi-diurnal constituents), but there are <b>major</b> <b>constituents</b> near 24hours (diurnal) as well. Longer term constituents are 14day or fortnightly, monthly, and semiannual. Semi-diurnal tides dominated coastline, but some areas such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents M2(lunar) and S2(solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14day period).|$|E

500|$|The {{national}} {{leadership of the}} former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to Christophe Jaffrelot, this {{proved to be an}} impossible assimilation. The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party. Violence between Hindus and Muslims increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at Aligarh and Jamshedpur in 1978–79. The other <b>major</b> <b>constituents</b> of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the Janata Party (Secular). The Morarji Desai government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left [...] to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party.|$|E
