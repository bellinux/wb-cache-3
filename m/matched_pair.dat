5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} {{automated}} MMPAs. A {{machine learning algorithm}} is used to finds all possible <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> in a data set according {{to a set of}} predefined rules.

40|$|<b>Matched</b> <b>pairs</b> {{are twice}} {{continuously}} measured data {{with the same}} categories. They can be represented as the square contingency tables. We can also consider symmetry and marginal homogeneity. Moreover, we can infer the <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> models; the symmetry model, the quasi-symmetry model, and the ordinal quasi-symmetry model. These inferences are involved in assumptions for special distributions. In this study, we visualize <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> models using modified correspondence analysis. Modified correspondence analysis can be used when square contingency tables are given; consequently, it {{is involved in the}} square and asymmetric correspondence matrix. This technique does not need assumptions for special distributions and is more helpful than the correspondence analysis to visualize <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> models...|$|R

Pellew, in his report on the action, stated that [...] "the cripped state of the Enemy allows me the Opportunity of saying, that her Resiliance could have been of no Avail, had the Artois been alone", but historian William James was more reserved, noting in 1827 that the ships [...] "would have been a well <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> of combatants, had the Artois been alone." [...] The prize money was extensive: part payment of £10,000 (£ as of [...] ) was made in January 1795, the reward shared between the entire squadron.

For example, an opulent 19th century antebellum example (a three-holer) is at the plantation area at the state park in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The outhouses of Colonial Williamsburg varied widely, from simple expendable temporary wood structures to high-style brick. See Jefferson's <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> of eight-sided brick privies.

2500|$|According to Britannica Online, [...] "In feudal Japan sumptuary {{laws were}} passed with a {{frequency}} and minuteness of scope {{that had no}} parallel {{in the history of}} the Western world." [...] During the Tokugawa period (1603–1868) in Japan, people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws that included regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. [...] In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class (chōnin) had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic samurai, and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the ability of the merchants to wear far more luxurious clothing and to own far more luxurious items. [...] The shogunate eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> when on official duty.|$|E

It is ok to only update these <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> since, by definition, only <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> have a chance of being the closest pair.|$|R

There the strangely <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> settled down quietly enough to their work of teaching and catechizing, for the mission had already been started by the native evangelist, and many of the people were fairly ready to hear and accept the new religion. For the first ten or twelve months Ethel's letters home were full of praise and love for dear John. Now that she had come to know him well, she wondered she had ever feared to marry him. No husband was ever so tender, so gentle, so considerate. He nursed her in all her little ailments like a woman; she leaned on him as a wife leans on the strong arm of her husband. And then he was so clever, so wise, so learned. Her only grief was that she feared she was not and would never be good enough for him. Yet it was well for her that they were living so entirely away from all white society at Butabué, for there she had nobody with whom to contrast John but the half-clad savages around them. Judged by the light of that startling contrast, good John Creedy, with his cultivated ways and gentle manners, seemed like an Englishman indeed.|$|E
