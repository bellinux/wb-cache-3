The dismal picture painted by {{the findings of the}} CARICOM research project demonstrated the dire need for comprehensive procurement reform.

40|$|In 2011, Linda Haller {{reported}} in Legal Ethics on proposals for national {{regulation of the}} legal profession in Australia. In common with other English-speaking federations, the legal profession in Australia is organised on a sub-national basis: in Australia’s case, there are separate professions (and some divided) in eight States and Territories. The federal Parliament has no power that would enable it to settle one scheme of regulation for lawyers across the country. However, the Australian federation had actually secured {{a high degree of}} harmonisation in the <b>Model</b> <b>Laws</b> on National Legal Practice (<b>Model</b> <b>Laws),</b> which all Australian jurisdictions, apart from South Australia, implemented between 2004 and 2008. The <b>Model</b> <b>Laws</b> set a similar structure for the regulation of lawyers, but within that structure allowed significant variations from State to State. ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, the {{conservative}} organization American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) drafted the [...] "Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act", a <b>model</b> <b>law</b> for distribution to lobbyists and state lawmakers. The <b>model</b> <b>law</b> proposed to prohibit [...] "entering an animal or research facility {{to take pictures}} by photograph, video camera, or other means {{with the intent to}} commit criminal activities or defame the facility or its owner". It also created a [...] "terrorist registry" [...] for those convicted under the law. Since then, bills to ban photographing or videotaping farms without the farmers' consent have been proposed or passed in Iowa (passed), Florida (defeated), New York (died), and Minnesota (died) in 2011; in Indiana (died), Utah (passed), South Carolina (passed), Nebraska (died), Illinois (defeated), and Missouri (passed, modified) in 2012; and in Arkansas (passed), Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New Hampshire (died), New Mexico (died), Tennessee (passed, vetoed), Wyoming, California, Vermont, and North Carolina in early 2013 (prompting Grist to ask if 2013 will be the [...] "year of ag-gag bills"). Three similar laws, more broad in scope rather than limited primarily to recording, were passed in Kansas, Montana and North Dakota in 1990 and 1991 (for more, see below).|$|E

2500|$|The legal {{situation}} concerning copyright in the Soviet Union {{in the early}} 1920s was confused. The Tsarist copyright law was still partially in effect, but its status was unclear. There {{were a number of}} decrees affecting copyright, but there was no unified legal treatment. The new Civil Law of the Russian SFSR, which became effective on January 1, 1923, did not contain any provisions on copyright either. In 1924, the Council of People's Commissars launched a project to develop a new copyright statute. On January 30, 1925, the Central Executive Committee passed the new Fundamentals of Copyright Law. These [...] "Fundamentals" [...] (...) were to serve as a <b>model</b> <b>law</b> for the laws of the individual republics of the Soviet Union, which allwith the exception of the Ukrainian SSRpassed laws implementing the Fundamentals at the republic level in 1925/26; the RSFSR Copyright Act was passed on October 11, 1926. All these republics' laws did not deviate from the Fundamentals. Only in the Azerbaijan SSR were the copyright provisions included in the Civil Code of the republic; in all other SSRs, the act was a separate ad-hoc piece of legislation.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} primarily with an examination and comparison of select {{aspects of the}} model international consumer protection laws proposed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), using the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Australia) {{as a basis for}} examination and comparison. As a secondary consideration, it also broadly examines the content of, and differences between, the <b>model</b> <b>laws.</b> The motive for this article is that any future enforceable international consumer protection regime (possibly {{in the form of an}} international treaty or convention) would need to take into account the UN, EU and OECD guidelines. A cross-comparison of those <b>model</b> <b>laws,</b> and a comparison of them with the consumer protection provisions of a well established national consumer protection law, should provide a useful starting point for the development of such a regime. The 2 ̆ 7 select aspects 2 ̆ 7 of the <b>model</b> <b>laws</b> in question are the various provisions of those laws which could relate to situations involving the wrong delivery or non-delivery of goods...|$|R
