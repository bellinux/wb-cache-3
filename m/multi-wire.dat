2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. <b>Multi-wire</b> saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques.

40|$|High Power Proton Accelerator (H. P. P. A.) {{projects}} are being proposed in fundamental and applied physics research: radioactive beam production, neutron sources, neutrino factories and transmutation. The front end design of these accelerators {{is based on}} a high intensity ion source (several mA up to 100 mA), followed by a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (R. F. Q.) to accelerate protons at several MeV. Finally the beam energy is increased up to 10 MeV or more by a Drift Tube Linac (D. T. L.). Among the parameters needed to be measured for beam control, monitoring and halo formation prevention, the transverse beam profiles are the most difficult to obtain. The large expected specific energy deposition in any interceptive monitor can lead to the destruction of the sensor and in addition to an appreciable amount of radiation production. Therefore traditional <b>multi-wires</b> chambers and wire scanners are not usable under too high duty factor pulsed-beam operation and obviously continuous beam operation. A very attractive phenomenon is the production of visible light by the proton beam-background or additional gas interaction. Transverse beam profiles of the “S. I. L. H. I. ” E. C.

However, several difficulties emerge to explain the difference shape between the transverse beam profiles deduced from the elementary observation of the emitted light by a C. C.

As part of this research program, feasibility studies of various types of RF cavities in a high magnetic field environment are in progress. As a unique approach, we have tested a RF cavity filled with a high pressure hydrogen gas with a 400 MeV proton beam in an external magnetic field (B = 3 T). Quantitative information {{about the number of}} protons passing through this cavity is an essential requirement of the beam test. The MTA is a flammable gas (hydrogen) hazard zone. Due to safety reasons, no active (energized) beam diagnostic instrument can be used. Moreover, when the magnetic field is on, current transformers (toroids) used for beam intensity measurements do not work due to the saturation of the ferrite material of the transformer. Based on these requirements, we have developed a passive beam diagnostic instrumentation using a combination of a Chromox- 6 scintillation screen and CCD camera. This paper describes details of the beam profile and position obtained from the CCD image with B = 0 T and B = 3 T, and for high and low intensity proton beams. A comparison is made with beam size obtained from <b>multi-wires</b> detector. Beam transmission efficiency through a collimator with a 4 mm diameter hole is measured by the toroids and CCD image of the scintillation screen. Results show that the transmission efficiency estimated from the CCD image is consistent with the toroid measurement, which enables us to monitor the beam transmission efficiency even in a high magnetic field environment. close 1...|$|R
40|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} {{is currently}} studied using {{either one of}} two techniques depending on the data needed. The first method is a multi-crevice former over a metallic sample; this provides information on the severity of crevice corrosion (depth, position, frequency) but delivers little to no electrochemical information [1]. The second method involves the potentiodynamic or potentiostatic study of an uncreviced sample in model crevice solution or under a crevice former in aggressive solution [2]. Crevice corrosion is highly dependent on the position in the crevice. The distance from the crevice mouth will affect the depth of attack, the solution composition and pH, and the ohmic drop and the true potential in the crevice [3 - 6]. These in turn affect the current density {{as a function of}} potential and position. A Multi-Channel Micro-Electrode Analyzer (MMA) has been recently used to demonstrate the interaction between localized corrosion sites (pitting corrosion and intergranular corrosion) [7]. MMA can provide spatial resolution of electrochemical properties in the crevice. By coupling such a tool with scaling laws derived from experimental data (a simple equation linking the depth of crevice corrosion initiation to the crevice gap), it is possible to produce highly instrumented crevices, rescaled to enable spatial resolution of local corrosion processes. In this study, the use of <b>multi-wires</b> arrays (up to 100 closed packed wires simulating a planar electrode, divided in 10 distinctively controllable groups) electrically coupled through zero resistance ammeters enables the observation of the current evolution as a function of position inside and outside the crevice. For instance, the location of crevice initiation sites and propagation behavior can be studied under various conditions. Experiments can be conducted with various realistic variables. These can either be electrochemical (such as proximate cathode) or physical (crevice former material or position). Using new impedance-capable MMA, it is also possible to monitor the film breakdown and the early stages of crevice corrosion {{as a function of the}} wires position.

40|$|Elastic guided {{waves are}} of {{interest}} for the non destructive evaluation of cables. Such structures are usually helical, <b>multi-wired</b> and highly prestressed, which greatly complicates the understanding of wave propagation from a theoretical point of view. A remarkable feature is the occurence of a missing frequency band in experimental time-frequency diagrams, {{sometimes referred to as}} notch frequency in the literature. The central frequency of this band increases under tensile loads. Recently, a numerical model has been proposed to compute the dispersion curves of prestressed helical seven-wire waveguides. Results have shown that the notch frequency indeed corresponds to a curve veering phenomenon between two longitudinal-like modes and that the increase of the notch under tensile loads is mainly due to interwire contact mechanisms. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} highlight the origin of this curve veering phenomenon, which is still unexplained up to the author's knowledge. This paper also provides further results which allow to clarify the accuracy of numerical solutions as well as the influence of contact assumptions. First, the static part of the model, necessary to compute the prestress state including contact effects, is checked from reference analytical solutions. Owing to the importance of contact, the accuracy of results is discussed both in statics and in dynamics. The influence of slip contact conditions is outlined. Then, some numerical tests are conducted by varying the Poisson coefficient and the helix lay angle. These tests allows to find out that the radial displacement constraint imposed on peripheral wires by the central one in the contact regions constitutes the main source of curve veering. More precisely, it is shown that a similar curve veering does occur for an uncoupled single peripheral wire when constrained by a radially blocked motion localised in its contact zone. Indeed, such a localised boundary condition completely breaks the circular symmetry of the wire cross-section, yielding coupling between longitudinal, flexural and torsional motion together with curve veering phenomena...|$|R
