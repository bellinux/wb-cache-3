40|$|The {{majority}} of monsoon depressions develop from the regenesis of westward-propagating residual lows from the east. Most of these residual lows {{can be traced}} to weather disturbances in the south China Sea, including tropical cyclones and 12 – 24 -day <b>monsoon</b> <b>lows.</b> Hypothetically, any mechanism causing a variation in the occurrence frequency of these two types of weather disturbances in the western tropical Pacific–south China Sea (WTP–SCS) region may result in a corresponding change in the formation frequency of monsoon depressions over the Bay of Bengal. Two such possible mechanisms are interannual and intraseasonal variations of large-scale summer circulation in the WTP–SCS region induced by 1) the interannual variation of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern tropical Pacific and 2) the northward migration of the 30 – 60 -day monsoon trough/ridge. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data and the 6 -hourly tropical cyclone track collected by the Japan Meteorological Agency for the period of 1979 – 94 were analyzed to substantiate the aforementioned hypothesis.

40|$|The {{summer monsoon}} {{season of the}} year 2006 was {{highlighted}} by an unprecedented number of <b>monsoon</b> <b>lows</b> over the central and the western parts of India, particularly giving widespread rainfall over Gujarat and Rajasthan. Ahmedabad had received 540. 2 mm of rainfall {{in the month of}} August 2006 against the climatological mean of 219. 8 mm. The two spells of very heavy rainfall of 108. 4 mm and 97. 7 mm were recorded on 8 and 12 August 2006 respectively. Due to meteorological complexities involved in replicating the rainfall occurrences over a region, the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF–ARW version) modeling system with two different cumulus schemes in a nested configuration is chosen for simulating these events. The spatial distributions of large-scale circulation and moisture fields have been simulated reasonably well in this model, though there are some spatial biases in the simulated rainfall pattern. The rainfall amount over Ahmedabad has been underestimated by both the cumulus parameterization schemes. The quantitative validation of the simulated rainfall is done by calculating the categorical skill scores like frequency bias, threat scores (TS) and equitable threat scores (ETS). In this case the KF scheme has outperformed the GD scheme for the low precipitation threshold. 1...|$|R

The first possible tropical cyclone developed within a trough of low pressure, {{to the southeast}} of Salvador, Brazil on January 18. The system subsequently displayed a small central dense overcast and was suspected {{to be at the}} peak of its development as either a tropical depression or a tropical storm during the next day. The system was subsequently affected by some strong shear, before it moved inland and weakened along the coast of Brazil before it was last noted during January 21. Within Brazil the system caused heavy rain and flooding with a state of emergency declared in Aracaju, after the river overflowed and burst its banks which flooded homes, destroyed crops and caused parts of the highway to collapse. However, it was noted that not all of the heavy rain and impacts were attributable to the system, as a large <b>monsoon</b> <b>low</b> covered much of Brazil at the time.

Early on 15 December, the system was named Felicity by TCWC Brisbane, after {{it had become a}} category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. During that day the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 07P, with peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 110 km/h (70 mph).

The system subsequently moved into the Coral Sea during 16 December, where it started to rapidly deepen, but did not reattain the classical characteristics of a tropical cyclone. As a result, both TCWC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane treated the system as a tropical depression over the next four days despite winds of between 110 and 115 km/h being observed in the southwest quadrant.

By late 28 January, a cyclone watch was declared by the Bureau of Meteorology for areas between Port Douglas and Proserpine. By 29 January, the low accelerated south-eastward slightly and continued intensifying, albeit slowly. Sea surface temperatures of 28 C assisted in the system's development and by 30 January, it reached tropical cyclone strength and was named Dylan by the BOM.

In this paper (Part II) results from a numerical simulation of TC Chris (western Australia, February 2002) are used to illustrate the primary and two secondary vortex enhancement mechanisms that led to TC genesis.
