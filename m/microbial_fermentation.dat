Two major components of plants, starch and cellulose, are both made of sugars—and can, in principle, be converted to sugars for fermentation.

25|$|Lactic acid is {{produced}} industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugar, starch) or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde, {{that is available}} from coal or crude oil. In 2009 lactic acid was produced predominantly (70-90%) by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 1:1 mixture of D and L stereoisomers, or of mixtures with up to 99.9% L-lactic acid, is possible by <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Industrial scale production of D-lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging.|$|E

Typical microorganisms used to make alcohol, such as yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces, cannot ferment these starches. Therefore, koji mold such as Aspergillus oryzae is used to first break down the starches into simpler sugars.|$|R

Associations between Escherichia coli O 157 prevalence and feeding of DG were investigated in feedlot cattle (n = 379) given one of three diets: steam-flaked corn (SFC) and 15 % corn silage with 0 or 25 % dried distillers’ grains (DDG) or SFC with 5 % corn silage and 25 % DDG. Ten fecal samples were collected from each pen weekly for 12 weeks to isolate E. coli O 157. Cattle fed 25 % DDG with 5 or 15 % silage had a higher (P = 0. 01) prevalence of E. coli O 157 than cattle fed a diet without DDG. Batch culture ruminal or fecal <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> were conducted to evaluate the effect of DDG on E. coli O 157 growth. The first study utilized microbial inocula from steers fed SFC or dry-rolled corn with 0 or 25 % DDG and included their diet as the substrate. Ruminal <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> from steers fed DDG had higher E. coli O 157 contents than ruminal <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> from steers fed no DDG (P < 0. 05) when no substrate was included. Fecal fermentations showed no DDG effect on E. coli O 157 growth. In the second study with DDG as a substrate, ruminal fermentations with 0. 5 g DDG had higher (P < 0. 01) E. coli O 157 concentrations at 24 h than ruminal fermentations with 0, 1, or 2 g DDG. In fecal fermentations, 2 g DDG resulted in a higher concentration (P < 0. 05) at 24 h than 0, 0. 5, or 1 g DDG. The results indicate {{that there is a}} positive association between DDG and E. coli O 157 in cattle, and the findings should have important ramifications for food safety...|$|R

500|$|Even {{when the}} leaves were quickly cooled, {{if they are}} left in piles (渥堆) for too long before processing, the leaves will begin to undergo <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentation</b> to produce [...] "post-fermented tea". This {{technique}} is somewhat similar to composting, albeit tightly controlled, and still used {{in the production of}} Liu'an tea (安徽六安籃茶) and was more recently introduced for the production of the [...] "ripe" [...] type pu-erh tea. The production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post-fermented tea, which was produced by aging. The long transport and storage times of the day unwittingly allowed the tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to the elements and to various microflora, which resulted in the aging, oxidation, and fermentation of green brick teas. A brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post-fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of the layer of detritus, dust, and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder, cooked, and then consumed. By the end of Tang Dynasty (618-907CE) green, yellow, and post-fermented tea was commonly used in China and moved from purely being used in herbology to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure.|$|E

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) produced during <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> determine {{the flavor of}} fermented food and are of interest {{for the production of}} fragrances or food additives. However, the microbial synthesis of these compounds from simple carbon sources has not been well investigated so far. Here, we analyzed the headspace over glucose minimal salt medium cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using multi-capillary column-ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS). The high sensitivity and fast data acquisition of the MCC-IMS enabled online analysis of the fermentation off-gas and 19 specific signals were determined. To four of these volatile compounds, we could assign the metabolites ethanol, 2 -pentanone, isobutyric acid, and 2, 3 -hexanedione by MCC-IMS measurements of pure standards and cross validation with thermal desorption–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements. Despite the huge biochemical knowledge of the biochemistry of the model organism S. cerevisiae, only the biosynthetic pathways for ethanol and isobutyric acid are fully understood, demonstrating the considerable lack of research of volatile metabolites.

2500|$|The common ostrich is well {{adapted to}} hot, arid environments through {{specialization}} of excretory organs. The common ostrich has an extremely long and developed colon {{the length of}} approximately [...] between the [...] and the paired caeca, which are around [...] long. A well developed caeca is also found and {{in combination with the}} rectum forms the <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentation</b> chambers used for carbohydrate breakdown. The catabolism of carbohydrates produces around [...] of water that can be used internally. The majority of their urine is stored in the coprodeum, and the faeces are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the ureters open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in scaling up <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> is the stability of the microbial strain: the engineered microorganism will attempt to mutate or shed the metabolic pathway, in part because intermediates in the metabolic pathway accumulate and are toxic to the cells.

30|$|Utilization of {{agricultural}} wastes {{for the production}} of fuels and chemicals using <b>microbial</b> <b>fermentations</b> is an attractive concept, due to the low costs of the raw material and beneficial environmental aspects.

Consequently, the ideal process would utilize an existing logistic chain and a feedstock that does not need extensive pre-treatment. Citrus processing waste (CPW) is an example of such a feedstock: its generation is centralized within a citrus processing plant and, due to low lignin content (Edwards and Doran-Peterson [2012]), it does not require extensive pre-treatment.|$|R
