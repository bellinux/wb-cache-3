5|$|The Free State was intended, above all, to be {{profitable}} for its investors and Leopold in particular. Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on ivory exports {{did not make}} as <b>much</b> <b>money</b> as hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting {{on a number of}} occasions. A boom in demand for natural rubber in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild rubber which could then be exported to Europe and North America. The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits. Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.|$|E

5|$|The {{football}} team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1, 1874, with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887.
