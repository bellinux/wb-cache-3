40|$|In {{the field}} of laser {{material}} processing 2 D-laser cutting seems to be state of the art. Therefore in {{the field of}} 3 D-laser material processing new approaches for a flexible laser beam handling have to be considered. In combination with a multi-joint industrial robot, an internal or external laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> could meet the requirements of flexibility and accessability. These laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>systems</b> cause problems as far as working space, path speed, dynamic behavior and the exactness of guidance are concerned. In an overview on existing concepts for laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>systems,</b> the possibilities for laser beam handling are discussed and system concepts for coupling a laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> to a robot are presented and evaluated. Different kinematic diagrams show the influence of the combination of laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>systems</b> and robot kinematic due to the system's workspace. The results will be shown with special respect to their influence on the workpiece and processing q uality. With this basic research an improved design of a 6 -axes laser robot with a combined (internal and external) laser beam <b>guiding</b> <b>system,</b> will be presented...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, three {{different}} controllers are proposed and simulated for maglev <b>guiding</b> <b>systems</b> to have convenient and smooth elevator motion. The proposed controllers are PID, sliding mode, and PID sliding mode controllers. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of the proposed controllers are discussed.

Unlike PID, the sliding mode controller is so robust, but its transient is unsuitable based on application conditions. However, an acceptable controller for ropeless elevator <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> should guaranty the passengers safety and convenient. Consequently, the response of the system should be fast, robust, and without considerable overshoots and oscillations.

40|$|Respiratory-gated {{radiation}} therapy (RGRT) {{is used to}} minimize the radiation dose to normal tissue in lung-cancer patients. Although determining the gating window in the respiratory phase of patients is important in RGRT, it is not easy. Our aim {{was to determine the}} optimal gating window when using a visible <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> for RGRT. Between April and October 2014, the breathing signals of 23 lung-cancer patients were recorded with a real-time position management (RPM) respiratory gating system (Varian, USA). We performed statistical analysis with breathing signals to find the optimal gating window for guided breathing in RGRT. When we compared breathing signals before and after the breathing training, 19 of the 23 patients showed statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05). The standard deviation of the respiration signals after breathing training was lowest for phases of 30 %- 70 %. The results showed that the optimal gating window in RGRT is 40 % (30 %- 70 %) with respect to repeatability for breathing after respiration training with the visible <b>guiding</b> <b>system.</b> RGRT was performed with the RPM system to confirm the usefulness of the visible <b>guiding</b> <b>system.</b> The RPM system and our visible <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> improve the respiratory regularity, which in turn should improve the accuracy and efficiency of RGRT...|$|R

50|$|Each type of web <b>guiding</b> <b>system</b> uses {{a sensor}} {{to monitor the}} web {{position}} for lateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path.

These sensors may be pneumatic, photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation.

The present research aims to improve the regularity of respiration in RGRT using a video coached respiration <b>guiding</b> <b>system.</b> In the study, 16 patients with lung cancer were evaluated. The respiration signals of the patients were measured by a real-time position management (RPM) Respiratory Gating System (Varian, USA) and the patients were trained using the video coached respiration <b>guiding</b> <b>system.</b> The patients performed free breathing and guided breathing, and the respiratory cycles were acquired for ~ 5 min. Then, Microsoft Excel 2010 software was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each phase. The standard deviation was computed in order to analyze the improvement in the respiratory regularity with respect to the period and displacement. The standard deviation of the guided breathing decreased to 65. 14 % in the inhale peak and 71. 04 % in the exhale peak compared with the values for the free breathing of patient 6.
