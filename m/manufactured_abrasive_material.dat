40|$|Abrasive {{blasting}} {{is widely}} used to clean and prepare metallic target materials. Particulate matter emissions from traditionally used <b>abrasive</b> <b>materials</b> (such as silica sand and coal slag) have long {{attracted the attention of}} regulatory agencies. This paper describes a field test program that compares particulate emissions from new Sponge Media with that from traditional abrasives. Sponge Media consists of polyurethane sponge material that has been impregnated with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>material.</b> The pliable nature of the sponge material allows it to surround the point of abrasive impact, thus forming a “microcontainment ” to capture dust and airborne emissions. The sponge also increases worker safety by dramatically reducing ricochet of the abrasive particles. The current test program compared particulate matter emissions from Sponge Media with emission data for <b>abrasive</b> <b>material</b> that form the basis for AP- 42 Section 13. 2. 6. To the extent practical, testing mimicked the prior program to enable direct comparison with the AP- 42 emission factors. Testing employed "exposure profiling " which has been recognized as the technique most appropriate to characterize the broad class of open anthropogenic particulate sources. Because the exposure profiling method isolates a single emission source, the open source emission factors with the highest quality ratings in AP- 42 are typically based on this approach. The program found that Sponge Media produces up to two orders of magnitude less total particulate and PM- 10 emissions than traditionally used abrasives...|$|R
