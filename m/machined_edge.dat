40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} automotive structures made of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) {{is often seen}} reduced {{by the presence of}} cut edges. An attempt is made to assess and quantify the initial damage state and the damage evolution during mechanical testing of a punched edge and a <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> via a recently developed 3 D imaging technique called synchrotron radiation computed laminography. This technique allows us to observe damage in regions of interest in thin sheet-like objects at micrometer resolution. In terms of new experimental mechanics, steel sheets having sizes and mechanical boundary conditions of engineering relevance can be tested {{for the first time with}} in situ 3 D damage observation and quantification. It is found for the investigated DP 600 steel that the fracture zone of the punched edge is rough and that needle-shape voids at the surface and in the bulk follow ferrite-martensite flow lines. During mechanical in situ testing the needle voids grow from the fracture zone surface and coalesce with the sheared zone. In contrast, during in situ mechanical testing of a <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> the damage starts away from the edge (∼ 800 μ m) where substantial necking has occurred. Three-dimensional image analysis was performed to quantify the initial damage and its evolution. These data can be used as input and validation data for micromechanical damage models. To interpret the experimental findings in terms of mechanical fields, combined surface digital image correlation and 3 D finite element analysis were carried out using an elasto-plastic constitutive law of the investigated DP steel. The stress triaxiality and the accumulated plastic strain were calculated in order to understand the influence of the edge profile and the hardening of the cutting-affected zone on the mechanical fields...|$|E

Cutting force analysis and surface characterization are conducted on the random direction short GFRPs with varying fiber contents (25 similar to 40 %). Edge trimming experiments are preformed using carbide inserts with varing the depth of cut and cutting speed. Machining characteristics of the Preform and SMC processed random direction short GFRPs are evaluated in terms of cutting forces, surface quality, and tool wear. It is found that composite primary processing and fiber contents are major contributing factors influencing the cutting force magnitudes and surface textures. The SMC composites show better surface finish over the Preform composites due to less delamination and fiber pullouts. Moreover, matrix damage and fiber protrusions at the <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> are reduced by increasing fiber content in the random direction short GFRP composites...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMachining of {{titanium}} alloys generates {{enormous amount of}} heat at the chip-tool interface leading to poor machinability. The current research investigates the effect of dry machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V on surface integrity of machined workpiece. A change in subsurface deformation was assessed by varying cutting speed and feed rate keeping the cut depth constant. Various output responses viz. cutting temperature, surface finish, induced strain, deformed depth, microhardness, etc. were discussed to evaluate the surface integrity. An optical microscopy, SEM and EBSD analysis performed on the <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> showed deformation induced damage with microstructural restructuring which was correlated with chip microstructure. At lower cutting parameters, work hardening phenomenon however; at high cutting parameters thermal softening phenomenon becomes more dominant. This was derived with increased surface roughness, reduction in microhardness values beneath the machined surface and coarse microstructure obtained at higher cutting parameters. A Chip microstructural analysis validates the thermal softening and work hardening phenomenon where at high cutting speeds and feed rate the shear band formation is increased accompanied with increased chip segmentation frequency. However, at lower cutting parameters the reduction segmentation frequency and more deformed grains near shear band were observed...|$|E

The flame-cut edges included both manual and guided flame-cut techniques. It is concluded from the tests that for all of the steels tested, the strength and the ductility of the <b>machined</b> <b>edges</b> is good. For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure, there was in some cases serious impairment of the physical properties. Even the automatic flame cutting impaired the properties of the silicon steel, but the ductility and strength were restored by subsequent appropriate flame softening of the edge. The sheared edge impaired the ductility of all of the steels tested. The greatest loss in ductility was caused in the semi-killed steel where the maximum strength also was reduced, in some instances falling as low as the yield strength. The harmful effect of the sheared edge on the ductility was apparently eliminated by a subsequent flame softening treatment. The strength and the ductility were increased to practically the same values as those of the same steel with <b>machined</b> <b>edges.</b> Only under the most damaging edge conditions was the strength at a brittle fracture as low as the yield point.

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs edge trimming {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. Edge trimming is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing edge trimming process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{master s}} thesis is to {{investigate}} the corrosion fatigue properties of an extruded AA 6082 alloy. Surface roughness deeply affects fatigue and corrosion fatigue. Surface roughness depends on the shaping process. Three shaping processes have been studied: machining, punching, and counter trimming. Counter trimming is a two-punch process, with the second punch coming from the opposite direction to the first punch. These shaping processes have very different surfaces and surface roughness. Corrosion fatigue tests has been executed with constant amplitude loading, R = 0. 1, and with samples submerged in a 5 wt% NaCl water solution. Every sample which were punched or counter trimmed, and tested in saltwater, were optically scanned prior to testing. The topography and surface roughness are therefore thoroughly accounted for. To account for fracture initiation, the minimum of four samples from each process were studied in SEM. Some additional samples tested in air were investigated in SEM as well. Corrosion rates, temperature, and humidity were also accounted for. The fatigue and corrosion fatigue life ranked as following: Machined > Counter trimmed > Punched. The difference between the processes were reduced when tested in saltwater. Fractography showed that the wounds created during punching and counter trimming were responsible for fracture initiation. For the machined series, the corners between the extruded and <b>machined</b> <b>edge</b> were responsible. The fracture surfaces had clearly visible grain boundaries in SEM. This was attributed to corrosion. The machined surface showed a far superior surface roughness, with very low Ra, Rt, Rz, and Rv values. Rv proved to be very accurate predicting which side of a sample would have fracture initiation. Topography also showed that the punching parameters used for the samples tested in this thesis were not ideal. Using the difference in corrosion rates between the different surfaces, the increase in surface area due to punching and counter trimming was determined. Compared to the machined surface, the punched and counter trimmed surface had an increase of surface area equal to a factor of 2. 55 and 2. 41, respectively...|$|E
