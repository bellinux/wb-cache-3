25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|After {{his victory}} Maguire {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Terry Griffiths {{who had been working}} with him on the mental side of the game: [...] "He's been on the phone just telling me to keep calm and that I can do it if I believe in myself". Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bashing. I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete".|$|E
500|$|The team gained {{international}} prominence {{after signing}} Laurent Jalabert before 2001, following his many {{years with the}} Spanish ONCE team of Manolo Saiz. Jalabert said that, [...] "I wanted to retire with a French team, but nobody gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> offer, so I went with CSC instead". At the time, CSC {{was sponsored by the}} French bike manufacturer Look, which is associated with Jalabert. The team also signed American Tyler Hamilton, formerly of U.S. Postal. The 2001 season was a breakthrough with Jalabert's win of the King of the Mountains competition and a stage on Bastille Day at the Tour de France. The season ended with Jalabert winning the 2001 Clásica de San Sebastián.|$|E

Besides his Toronto-based producer team, Drake also collaborated with European producer Crada, who previously worked on Kid Cudi's 2009 debut album [...] Drake told Entertainment Weekly that he collaborated with an Indie pop band named Francis and the Lights. Kevin Rudolf also participated in the album's recording, contributing with keyboards on [...] "Show <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> Time" [...] and [...] "Find Your Love". R singer Mary J. Blige contributed additional vocals to the track [...] "Fancy". In March 2010, Drake confirmed that he had recorded a track with Eminem and Dr. Dre. In early November 2009, Lil Wayne released an official statement explaining that Thank Me Later had been completed, though Drake later commented {{that he was still}} working on the album. On April 26, 2010, Drake announced to a crowd during a show that he had finished recording and had turned in a final copy of the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fireworks" [...] {{references}} {{the divorce}} of Drake's parents and alludes to his brief fling with Rihanna. [...] "Karaoke" [...] features background keyboards that {{add to the}} song's 1980s musical influence, with lyrics about the difficulty of relationships. In [...] "The Resistance", Drake worries about fame changing him, with lyrics veering from his ailing grandmother to a one-night stand that resulted in an abortion. [...] "Over" [...] incorporates an orchestral backdrop, and according to Michael Cragg of musicOMH, contains three hooks. The artful song is about the elation and confusion that accompanies fame. [...] "Show <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> Time" [...] opens and closes with a squeaky yelling sound. On the song, Drake talks addresses hip hop listeners who find him inauthentic. [...] "Up All Night" [...] has menacing strings, and Drake boastfully rapping about his nightlife, while trading lines with Nicki Minaj. The club song [...] "Fancy" [...] has a predominant hook, looped samples, and backwards strings. It is an ode to women who spend hours primping {{in preparation for the}} nightlife. The song features vocals by producer Swizz Beatz and T.I., with additional harmonies by Mary J. Blige at the song's conclusion. [...] "Shut It Down" [...] is a piano ballad and slow jam.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E
500|$|Goater's trial {{resulted}} in the offer of a professional contract, {{but he did not}} break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> two years to get used to life in England. At first I thought the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] Shakira also wrote and recorded a Spanish-version of the song entitled [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)".|$|E

2500|$|Mahan {{also played}} for Harvard's varsity {{baseball}} team for three years. In {{an exhibition game}} {{in the spring of}} 1916, Mahan pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox, the year after the Red Sox team featuring Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker won the 1915 World Series. [...] Mahan was offered a contract by several major league clubs, but none was willing to meet his demand for a salary of $6,500. Mahan described his negotiations {{in an interview with the}} Oakland Tribune:"I had a chance first to go with the Boston Red Sox when I was in my senior year at Harvard. They said to name my price and I named $6,500. They thought it was too much. Then the Detroit club made an offer to me but they too thought I had a gold-brick scheme. The Chicago White Sox were willing to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> contract with a bonus if I made good, but the risk was not worth the undertaking. I considered the Braves more seriously than any other team but my negotiations there too were not satisfactory ..." ...|$|E
