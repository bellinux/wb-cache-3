The present work evaluates <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> from aqueous environmental samples in the simultaneous analysis {{of a group of}} 9 specific pharmaceuticals with HPLC-ESI/MS/MS and UPLC-ESI/MS/MS: flubendazole, propiconazole, pipamperone, cinnarizine, ketoconazole, miconazole, rabeprazole, itraconazole and domperidone. When HPLC-MS/MS is used, <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are substantial and can not be compensated for with analogue internal standards. For different surface water samples different <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are found. For accurate quantification the standard addition approach is necessary. Due to the better resolution and more narrow peaks in UPLC, analytes will co-elute less with interferences during ionisation, so <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> could be lower, or even eliminated. If <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are eliminated with this technique, the standard addition method for quantification can be omitted and the overall method will be simplified. Results show that <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are almost eliminated if internal standards (structural analogues) are used.

However, these techniques are prone to <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> that need to be considered when developing and validating methods. The analysis of shellfish is a challenging task due to the complexity of the shellfish matrix and the number of shellfish species encountered in monitoring laboratories. Therefore, it is crucial that the cause and the extent of <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> is fully understood in order to apply corrective measures to the analytical method and to develop efficient sample clean-up steps. This paper presents different approaches to evaluate <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> associated with the analysis of okadaic acid, azaspiracid- 1 and pectenotoxin- 2 in cooked and raw mussel flesh. Post extraction addition and standard addition experiments were carried out, and analysed using various LC-MS methods.

With HPLC-ESI-MS/MS having the characteristics of high selectivity, sensitivity, and throughput, this technology is being increasingly used in the clinical laboratory. An important issue {{to be addressed in}} method development, validation, and routine use of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS is <b>matrix</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>Matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are the alteration of ionization efficiency by the presence of coeluting substances. These effects are unseen in the chromatograrn but have deleterious impact on methods accuracy and sensitivity. The two common ways to assess <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are either by the postextraction addition method or the postcolumn infusion method. To remove or minimize <b>matrix</b> <b>effects,</b> modification to the sample extraction methodology and improved chromatographic separation must be performed. These two parameters are linked together and form the basis of developing a successful and robust quantitative HPLC-EST-MS/MS method. Due to the heterogenous nature of the population being studied, the variability of a method must be assessed in samples taken from a variety of subjects. In this paper, the major aspects of <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are discussed with an approach to address <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> during method validation proposed.

A large array of ion-exchange, silica-based, and mixed-function SPE sorbents was tested. Polymeric sorbents {{were found to}} retain most of the toxins. Optimization experiments were carried out to maximize recoveries {{and the effectiveness of}} the clean-up. In LC¿MS/MS analysis, the observed <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> can depend on the chromatographic conditions used, therefore, two different HPLC methods were tested, using either an acidic or an alkaline mobile phase. The recovery of the optimized SPE protocol was around 90 % for all toxins studied and no break-through was observed. The <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> were determined by comparing signal response from toxins spiked in crude and SPE-cleaned extracts with those derived from toxins prepared in methanol. In crude extracts, all toxins suffered from <b>matrix</b> <b>effects,</b> although in varying amounts. The most serious effects were observed for okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX 2) in the positive electrospray ionization mode (ESI+). SPE clean-up on polymeric sorbents in combination with the alkaline LC method resulted in a substantial reduction of <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> to less than 15 % (apparent recovery between 85 and 115 %) for OA, yessotoxin (YTX) in ESI¿ and azaspiracid- 1 (AZA 1), PTX 2, 13 -desmethyl spirolides C (SPX 1), and gymnodimine (GYM) in ESI+.

Furthermore, adding surfactant enhances the dispersion of the agglomerates.

For example, location of maximum axial normal stress becomes closer to the tip of CNH as the cone angle increases (Figure on the right).

As food components, wheat protein, milk protein, meat protein, lactose, fructose, galactose, glucose, salt, vitamin C, starch, cooked starch, vitamin E, linoleic acid, cellulose, citric acid and pectin were used. Total phenolic content, total anthocyanin content, phenolic profile and anthocyanin profiles by HPLC-PAD were analyzed to evaluate the bioavailability in pomegranate, pomegranate plus foods and pomegranate plus their components after the application of in vitro digestion method. The results were compared with the application of vitro digestion method to the pomegranate and they were statistically evalıated whether there were any difference after co-consumption. Anthocyanins are found to have lower bioavailability during digestion when compared to phenolic compounds. In conclusion, protein and vitamin C content should not be high while consuming or developing a product with pomegranate, which is rich in anthocyanins. Furthermore, one should be aware that sugar and fat content have no negative effect on anthocyanin bioavailability. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Title of Doctoral Thesis: <b>Matrix</b> <b>effects</b> in LC-MS analysis: occurrence, evaluation, {{and their}} {{elimination}} The dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} issue of <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> in analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS represents a well-established, widely used, and powerful tool in the field of qualitative and quantitative analysis {{of a wide range of}} different compounds. Despite all the advantages offered by LC-MS such as sensitivity, selectivity, and robustness, it suffers from a major drawback represented by <b>matrix</b> <b>effects.</b> This undesirable phenomenon affects important parameters of LC-MS method such as accuracy, precision, linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. Therefore, an evaluation of these effects should be involved in validation of every single LC-MS method and their source should be eliminated. The assessment is generally performed by qualitative and quantitative approaches such as post-extraction addition, post-column infusion, and comparison of slopes of calibration curves. The <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> can be reduced or [...] ...|$|R
30|$|LC-MS/MS is {{commonly}} used for detecting cathinones. However, Concheiro et al. (2013) showed the matrix suppression was observed in urine sample of cathinones by LC-MS/MS analysis. Endogenous interferences in urine have suppressed cathinone, mephedrone, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) detections by LC-MS/MS up to 27, 11, and 9 %, respectively. By IUPAC definition, <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> are “the combined effect of all components of the sample other than the analyte on the measurement of the quantity” (Guilbault and Hjelm 1989). Many {{studies have been conducted}} to provide the solution to overcome the <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> (Lehotay et al. 2010; Stahnke et al. 2012). This study was aimed to explore the standard addition method as a means to overcome the plasma <b>matrix</b> <b>effects</b> on the quantification of cathinone and mephedrone by LC-MS/MS. We developed LC-MS/MS methods that utilized standard addition without internal standard (IS).|$|R
