5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash</b> (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine.

50|$|The {{less obvious}} digital {{contributions}} into an analog scene include lens effects {{such as the}} fish-eye lens, motion blur to more vividly portray movement, instability in {{the focus of the}} camera, unstable light exposure, lighting effects such as shadows, and gun <b>muzzle</b> <b>flashes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash</b> temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E

50|$|As {{the crew}} of Spooky 71 manned their {{aircraft}} patrolling the area, the pilot Major Kenneth Carpenter had seen <b>muzzle</b> <b>flashes</b> outside Long Binh Army Base. The pilot threw the AC-47 and its eight-man crew into a banked turn to engage the Viet Cong in the Tan Son Nhut Air Base area.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} {{countermeasures}} to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy's creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that {{was following the}} creeping barrage. Microphones (Sound ranging) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in counter-battery fire. <b>Muzzle</b> <b>flashes</b> of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.|$|R
25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash</b> was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The Phantom's {{service as}} a {{frontline}} fighter would be short-lived. Its limited range and light armament– notably, its inability to carry bombs– made it best suited for duty as a point-defence interceptor aircraft. However, its speed and rate of climb were only slightly better than existing propeller-powered fighters and fell short of other contemporary jets, such as the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, prompting concerns that the Phantom would be outmatched by future enemy jets it might soon face. Moreover, recent experience in World War II had demonstrated the value of naval fighters that could double as fighter-bombers, a capability the Phantom lacked. Finally, the aircraft exhibited some design deficiencies– its navigational avionics were poor, it could not accommodate newly developed ejection seats, {{and the location of}} the machine guns in the upper nose caused pilots to be dazzled by <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Comic" [...] was a Camel variant {{designed}} specifically for night-fighting duties. The twin Vickers guns were replaced by two Lewis guns on Foster mountings firing forward over the top wing, as the <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash</b> of the Vickers guns could blind the pilot. To allow reloading of the guns, the pilot was moved about 12 inches (30cm) to the rear and to compensate the fuel tank was moved forward.

25|$|The 1st Battalion 7th Marines, {{including}} Lee, {{landed at}} Inchon on September 21, 1950, {{to attack the}} North Koreans and force them to retreat northwards. The People's Republic of China sent troops to stiffen the North Korean fighting response. On the night of November 2–3 in the Sudong Gorge, Lee's unit was attacked by Chinese forces. Lee kept his men focused by directing them to shoot at the enemy's <b>muzzle</b> <b>flashes.</b> Following this, Lee single-handedly advanced upon the enemy front and attacked their positions one by one to draw their fire and reveal themselves. His men fired at the <b>muzzle</b> <b>flashes</b> and inflicted casualties, forcing the enemy to retreat. While advancing, Lee shouted to the enemy in Mandarin Chinese to sow confusion and then attacked with hand grenades and gunfire. Lee {{was wounded in the}} knee and in the morning light was shot in the right elbow by a sniper, shattering the bones. He was evacuated to a MASH unit (an army field hospital) outside of Hamhung. For bravely attacking the enemy and saving his men, Lee was awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest honor given for combat bravery.|$|R

2500|$|Accounts differ if Bogan {{drew his}} {{revolver}} {{or that he}} already had an unholstered revolver behind his back.

As Gunn fell face down to the floor, Gunn pulled his own pistol, {{but before he could}} bring it up Bogan ran over and shot him point blank in the head, killing him. Bogan was so close when he fired this second shot, that the <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash</b> caught Gunn's hair on fire. Bogan brandished his pistol at the shocked patrons, and ran out, mounting a horse belonging to Jack Andrews. However, Deputy Marshal John Owens was quick to respond, and blocked Bogan's only exit from town. Owens fired one blast into the air as a warning, and when Bogan continued riding forward, Owens shot him in the shoulder, knocking Bogan from his saddle and into the street.|$|E
2500|$|...303 British cartridges, {{along with}} the Lee–Enfield rifle, were heavily criticized after the Second Boer War. Their heavy round-nosed bullets had low muzzle {{velocities}} and suffered compared to the 7×57mm rounds fired from the Mauser Model 1895. The high-velocity 7×57mm had a flatter trajectory and longer range that excelled on the open country of the South African plains. In 1910, work began on a long-range replacement cartridge, which emerged in 1912 as the [...]276 Enfield. The British also sought to replace the Lee–Enfield rifle with the Pattern 1913 Enfield rifle, based on the Mauser M98 bolt action design. Although the round had better ballistics, troop trials in 1913 revealed problems including excessive recoil, <b>muzzle</b> <b>flash,</b> barrel wear and overheating. Attempts were made to find a cooler-burning propellant, but further trials were halted in 1914 by the onset of World War I. As a result, the Lee–Enfield rifle was retained, and the [...]303 British cartridge (with the improved Mark VII loading) was kept in service.|$|E

Four-digit numbers identified experimental propellants, and a few successful varieties warranted extensive production by several manufacturers.
