40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} zinc on retinal cells at concentrations at which it is known to cause oxidative stress. Furthermore, the effects of <b>metipranolol,</b> known to prevent retinal damage, and of other antiglaucoma drugs were determined on zinc-injured retinal cells. METHODS. Lipid peroxidation assays were conducted on rat brain and bovine retina–retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) membrane preparations. Immunohistochemistry, immunoblot analysis and the terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-linked nick-end labeling (TUNEL) procedure determined the effects of zinc with or without trolox or <b>metipranolol</b> on photoreceptor death in situ. The effect of treatments on cultured RPE cells was analyzed using cell viability assays, immunoblot analysis, and the TUNEL procedure. RESULTS. Zinc-induced lipid peroxidation of rat brain and bovine retina–RPE membranes, although the effect of the latter was of a (twofold) greater magnitude. Both effects, however, were similarly attenuated by <b>metipranolol,</b> desacetylmetipranolol, and trolox. Antiglaucoma drugs other than <b>metipranolol</b> had no effect. Intraocular injection of 150 �M zinc and treatment of cultured RPE cells with zinc led to mainly photoreceptor apoptosis and apoptotic death of RPE cells (50 % death at 18 �M rising to 10 % at 50 �M), respectively. Zinc-induced apoptosis of cultured RPE cells and photoreceptors were attenuated only by <b>metipranolol</b> and trolox. CONCLUSIONS. The combined data suggest that oxidative injury to RPE cells and photoreceptors may be caused by elevated levels of zinc in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and that <b>metipranolol</b> may act as an efficacious antioxidant to blunt this process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{for the first}} time documented evidence, clinical details, and photographic illustrations of metipranolol-associated granulomatous anterior uveitis in 26 eyes of 15 patients being treated for glaucoma.

40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} effect of topical and {{systemic}} application of a β adrenergic receptor blocker on retinal haemodynamics.  METHODS— 24 healthy subjects were included in this double masked, randomised, placebo controlled crossover study. <b>Metipranolol,</b> a non-selective β adrenergic receptor blocking agent was used as test drug. In all subjects arm-retina time, arteriovenous passage time, arterial mean dye velocity, the arterial vessel diameters, and capillary flow velocity were quantified from digital video fluorescein angiograms.  RESULTS—A significant effect was observed on the arteriovenous passage time (p< 0. 05), the arterial mean dye bolus velocity (p< 0. 05), and capillary blood velocity (p< 0. 05), {{but not on the}} arterial vessel diameter. The arterial mean dye bolus velocity and capillary blood velocity increased after application of the test drug (topical and systemic). In tandem with this a decrease of the arteriovenous passage time was observed. The perfusion pressure increased after topical application and remained unchanged after systemic application of <b>metipranolol.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—This study shows that systemic as well as topical application of <b>metipranolol</b> leads to increased retinal blood flow velocities. The implications of these results for treatment with β adrenergic receptor blockers is not clear. However, in view of these data it is very unlikely that treatment with <b>metipranolol</b> has a negative effect on retinal blood flow.    Keywords: retinal microcirculation; β adrenergic blockers; scanning laser ophthalmoscop...|$|E
30|$|<b>Metipranolol</b> is a non-selective topical {{beta-blocker}} {{used for}} the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Shortly after its introduction, reports of associated granulomatous anterior uveitis began to appear [95 – 102]. Akingbehin and Villada presented the findings of 56 episodes of granulomatous anterior uveitis in 26 eyes of 15 patients [96]. Nearly all cases of uveitis occurred with the 0.6 % dose compared to the 0.3 % dose, leading to the withdrawal of the 0.6 % dose from the market in 1990. Most cases developed after 7 to 31 months of therapy and patients typically presented with cell, flare, and granulomatous keratic precipitates, and 2 % developed posterior synechiae. Over 50 % of eyes also developed ocular hypertension. With discontinuation of <b>metipranolol</b> and initiation of topical corticosteroids, patients generally did quite well, with resolution of the inflammation after 3 to 5 weeks. In addition to a large number of case reports, positive rechallenge data confirm the association between <b>metipranolol</b> and the inflammation [103]. Initial hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of metipranolol-induced uveitis centered around sterilization methods (i.e., gamma irradiation) used for multidose bottles; however, adverse reactions have been seen with single-dose bottles as well as with other sterilization methods [98, 100].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Uveitis {{has been}} {{reported}} in association with a variety of topical, intraocular, periocular, and systemic medications. To establish causality of adverse events by drugs, in 1981, Naranjo and associates proposed seven criteria, which are related to the frequency and documentation of the event; circumstances of occurrence, recovery, and recurrence; and coexistence of other factors or medications. Rarely does a drug meet all seven criteria. The authors review reports of drug-associated uveitis, applying the seven criteria and examining possible mechanisms. Only systemically administered biphosphonates and, perhaps, topical <b>metipranolol</b> meet all seven criteria. Systemic sulfonamides, rifabutin, and topical glucocorticoids fulfill at least five criteria. (Surv Ophthalmol 42 : 557 - 570, 1998. © 1998 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.)

40|$|Topical beta {{adrenergic}} receptor blocking agents (beta blockers) {{are among the}} most frequently prescribed ophthalmic drugs. It has been suggested that some of these agents have a toxic effect on the corneal epithelium. In the present study, four beta blockers in common therapeutic concentrations, as well as their vehicles, were applied to rabbit corneas that had undergone mechanical removal of epithelium from a 6 mm diameter corneal wound. The tested drugs (0. 25 % timolol, 0. 25 % levobunolol, 0. 25 % betaxolol, and 0. 3 % <b>metipranolol)</b> were found significantly to accelerate wound closure, compared with saline treatment in controls. Eyes treated with two of the vehicles (betaxolol vehicle and <b>metipranolol</b> vehicle) also demonstrated more rapid healing than controls, but the magnitude of the effect was not as great as that seen with the drugs. Only the beta blockers were responsible for wound closure before 60 hours, whereas the saline treated controls and vehicle treated eyes required longer times for wound closure. In this model of wound healing, beta blockers appear to have no deleterious effect on corneal epithelial wound healing...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we have {{compared}} three analytical techniques (ELISA, GC-MS, and LC-MS) {{for the analysis}} of 16 beta-blockers: acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, carteolol, labetalol, <b>metipranolol,</b> metoprolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, timolol, and bupranolol.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the changes of respiratory rate, systemic blood pressure and heart rate variability parameters (HRV) during orthostasis in anaesthetized rabbits. Furthermore, these changes were influenced by affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and autonomic nervous system (ANS) to study the mechanisms participating in activity of spectral frequency bands of HRV in rabbits. Ten adult rabbits (Chinchilla) were anaesthetized by ketamine and flunitrazepam. The systemic blood pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate were measured. HRV was evaluated by microcomputer system VariaPulse TF 3 E. The R-R intervals were derived from the electrocardiogram signal from subcutaneous needle electrodes. The evaluation of HRV in very low (VLF; 0. 01 - 0. 05 Hz), low (LF; 0. 05 - 0. 15 Hz) and high frequency bands (HF; 0. 15 - 2. 0 Hz) was made and parameters of frequency and time analysis were calculated.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between ultrasonication and microwave irradiation as tools {{to achieve a}} rapid sample treatment {{for the analysis of}} banned doping substances in human urine by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed. The following variables were studied and optimised: (i) time of treatment, (ii) temperature, (iii) microwave power and (iv) ultrasonic amplitude. The results were evaluated and compared with those achieved by the routine method used in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited Antidoping Laboratory of Rome. Only under the effect of the ultrasonic field was it possible to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction rate of conjugated compounds. Similar reaction yield to the routine method was achieved after 10 min for most compounds. Under microwave irradiation, denaturation of the enzyme occurs for high microwave power. The use of both ultrasonic or microwave energy to improve the reaction rate of the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethyliodosilane/methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (TMSI/MSTFA/NH 4 I/ 2 -mercaptoethanol) was also evaluated. To test the use of the two systems in the acceleration of the reaction with TMSI, a pool of 55 banned substances and/or their metabolites were used. After 3 min of ultrasonication, 34 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to those obtained with the classic procedure that lasts for 30 min (Student's∈t test, n∈=∈ 5), 18 increased to higher silylation yields, and for the compounds 13 β, 17 α-diethyl- 3 α, 17 β-dihydroxy- 5 α-gonane (norboletone metabolite 1), metoprolol and <b>metipranolol</b> the same results were obtained increasing the ultrasonication time to 5 min. Similar results were obtained after 3 min of microwave irradiation at 1, 200 W. In this case, 30 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to the classic procedure (Student's t test, n∈=∈ 5) whilst 18 had higher silylation yields.

40|$|Ganglion {{cell death}} in {{glaucoma}} is probably caused by insults that include ischemia {{and the influence}} of light to their many axonally located mitochondria. Experimental studies were conducted to determine whether light as impinging on the retina in situ (400 - 760 nm) affects cell function detrimentally in culture and retinal ganglion cells, in situ. Moreover, studies were carried out to deduce whether nicotinamide can plunt any negative light influences to cells in culture and/or a defined ischemic insult to the retina as this might suggest its use for the treatment of glaucoma. Light (1000 lux generally, 400 Ã‚Â· 760 nm) caused a generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis to transformed retinal ganglion cells (RGC- 5 cells), fibroblast BJHtert cells and neurones in primary retinal cell cultures. Neurones in primary retinal cultures were particularly susceptible to a light insult followed by the RGC- 5 cells and then the BJHtert cells. Moreover, the influence of light was enhanced when cells were stressed caused by reducing serum levels or by the inclusion of sub-lethal amounts of rotenone to the culture medium. Significantly, light exposure did not result in a generation ofROS or cause apoptosis to BJHtert rho cells which lacked functional mitochondria. These studies support the view that light affects mitochondria to cause cell death which is enhanced when the cells are stressed, and that neurones are particularly susceptible because of their reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for general metabolism. Nicotinamide was able to attenuate the detrimental effect ofa light-insult to RGC- 5 cells but only if the insult was for a duration of 96 and not 48 hours. In contrast, selected substances, thought to act by sustaining mitochondrial function (alipoic acid, trolox, epigallicatechin gallate, <b>metipranolol,</b> coenzyme QIO and melatonin), attenuated the negative influence caused by a light insult of only 48 hours. Detailed studies on RGC- 5 cells shows that the degree of apoptosis is dependent on the duration of a light insult and that maximal generation of ROS and reduction of cell ATP occurred at different times. Moreover, apoptosis was caspase-independent, involves the activation and translocation of apoptosis inhibitory factor (AIF) to nuclei as well as an activation of PARP-l, which was particularly significant for a light insult of 96 hours. Evidence is provided to show that nicotinamide blunts the activation of PARP-l at this time point. Exposure of eyes from anesthetised rats which had their pupils maximally dilated to a regem of white (400 - 760 nm) and red (550 - 760 nm) of identical intensities revealed that ganglion cell specific proteins and mRNAs were affected by the white but not the red light. The results suggest that light of defined wave-lengths (probably blue-violet range) can affect ganglion cell function in situ. but precisely how this occurs remains unknown. Nicotinamide was also shown to counteract a number of detrimental influences to the retina following ischemialreperfusion that included damage to ganglion cells and other specific retinal cell-types. Evidence is therefore provided to show that nicotinamide can attenuate the negative effects of both ischemia and light, which have been proposed to be a cause for ganglion cell death in glaucoma.
