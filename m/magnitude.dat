5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent <b>magnitude</b> at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it.

The program gave an apparent <b>magnitude</b> of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent <b>magnitude</b> of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km.
