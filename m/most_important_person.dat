25|$|Charles {{inherited}} the Portuguese Restoration War {{and soon after}} his accession Spain was plunged into the War of Devolution with France in the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté. As regent, Mariana managed the country's affairs {{through a series of}} favourites ("validos"), whose merits usually amounted to no more than meeting her fancy. Her validos included her confessor, Juan Everardo Nithard, whom she made Grand Inquisitor in 1666, and which gave him access to the Regency Council, from where he became the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>person</b> of the Spanish Court. From then on he was the de facto prime minister or valido of Spain. The sheer size of the kingdom at that time made this kind of government increasingly damaging to the realm's affairs. By 1668, Nithard was desperate to reduce Spain's military commitments at almost any price, and to end the Portuguese Restoration War; so he accepted the loss of the Crown of Portugal and formally recognized the sovereignty of the House of Braganza by signing the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty ceded the North African enclave of Ceuta to Spain, but marked the loss of Portugal and the Portuguese colonies. To end the War of Devolution, Nithard signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). However, the members of the Councils and in particular Charles's illegitimate half-brother John, a popular military commander, started intriguing to overthrow the queen-regent's favorite. In February 1669, a military revolt in Aragon and Catalonia led by John, who then proceeded to march toward Madrid, brought about Nithard's dismissal.|$|E
