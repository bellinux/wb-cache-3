5|$|Upon the school's {{relocation}} suggestions were solicited {{for a new}} name, {{and social}} studies teacher Ted Johnson submitted the winning entry. The school was named after photographer, film director and local icon Gordon Parks. Parks grew up in Saint Paul, attending local high schools such as Mechanic Arts High School and Saint Paul Central. Like <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> the school targets, Parks struggled with events outside of school and eventually dropped out.|$|E

Similarly, during the Summer Term many students DJs are unable to do their shows owing to exams.|$|R
5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E

In addition, in 2006 Yeshivat Sha'alvim assumed the control of the Isaac Breuer Institute (also formerly affiliated with Poalei Agudat Israel, founded in memory of the movement's German-Jewish ideologue of that name), which issues the scholarly quarterly HaMa'ayan.|$|E

25|$|Trumbull was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York City, serving for twenty years, from 1816 to 1836.

In 1825 <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> withdrew, founding the National Academy of Design. Unable to accommodate to changing tastes, the American Academy later closed in 1839 after a second fire destroyed its collections.|$|E

25|$|On July 28, 2017, UC Irvine {{rescinded}} {{the admission}} offers of over 500 incoming undergraduates. While the university claimed they rescinded so many offers of admission due to 2nd semester high school grades and late transcripts, some people speculate {{the real reason}} is too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> receiving admission offers accepting them. Approximately 7,100 of 31,000 freshmen offered admission to UC Irvine in 2017 accepted it, which is 850 more students than UC Irvine's planned freshman class of 6,250.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{prototype}} Primary School began, and later carrying into the Primary Schools at engineering colleges, it was realized that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> being admitted {{did not have the}} necessary capabilities or willingness for training of this nature. In late 1942, BuPers* directed that a one-month Pre-Radio School be added to the ETP. Through this, weeding in addition to the Eddy Test would result, and special preparation could also be received. (*) The Bureau of Navigation (BuNav) was renamed Bureau of Naval Personnel (BuPers – later BUPERS) in May 1942.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> like the Miner children, were used to driving to and from school with a horse and buggy, but the school teacher had a rule that no child was permitted to drive home in bad weather without permission from a parent. William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E
50|$|For <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madadeni <b>students,</b> most <b>of</b> whom {{came from}} very rural areas, the PLATO {{terminal}} {{was the first}} time they encountered any kind <b>of</b> electronic technology. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first-year <b>students</b> had never seen a flush toilet before. There initially was skepticism that these technologically illiterate students could effectively use PLATO, but those concerns were not borne out. Within an hour or less most <b>students</b> were using <b>the</b> system proficiently, mostly to learn math and science skills, although a lesson that taught keyboarding skills was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most popular. A few students even used on-line resources to learn TUTOR, the PLATO programming language, and a few wrote lessons on the system in the Zulu language.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{foreign-born}} <b>students</b> {{left when}} <b>the</b> Soviet army invaded from the east, the yeshiva continued to operate, albeit on a reduced scale, until the approaching Nazi armies caused <b>the</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yeshiva {{to move the}} entire yeshiva community to Keidan, Lithuania.|$|R

25|$|Originally {{the brainchild}} of Bryn Mawr {{president}} M. Carey Thomas, the program was funded by philanthropists such as John D. Rockefeller Jr. and taught by distinguished faculty drawn from local institutions. Under the direction of Hilda Worthington Smith it evolved into a successful workers' education program {{that served as the}} model for several others. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> who came from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds and worked in a variety of industries, went on to become union leaders. For political reasons, the program fell out of favor with the college board of trustees and was terminated in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Two {{shopping}} centres {{adjacent to}} Dawson, Place Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square, {{directly linked to}} the Atwater metro station, were evacuated and the green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between Lionel-Groulx and McGill. The Pepsi Forum entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> came running into the premises to seek refuge moments after the shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum's entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} {{carried out}} mass arrests. Many workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students – {{many of whom}} came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well-connected – received much lighter sentences. Wang Dan, the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again. Some student leaders such as Chai Ling and Wuer Kaixi were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other Western nations under Operation Yellowbird that was organized from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time.|$|E
