25|$|Sometimes a gene, {{after being}} turned on, transcribes {{a product that}} (directly or indirectly) {{maintains}} the activity of that gene. For example, Hnf4 and MyoD enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the transcription factor activity of the proteins they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development. Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different splice forms of RNA, or by formation of double-stranded RNA (RNAi). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are often turned on or off by signal transduction, although in some systems where syncytia or gap junctions are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by diffusion. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the zygote by the mother during oogenesis or via nurse cells, resulting in <b>maternal</b> <b>effect</b> phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning an effect by the mothers of the flesh fly population. [...] There is a <b>maternal</b> <b>effect</b> that operates in S. bullata that can prevent pupal diapause when reared under short day conditions. It was determined that certain environmental stressors or chemical treatments on the mother, such as extreme temperature shocks, food deprivation and reducing maternal size, were ineffective in altering the diapause-suppressant. However, there were several chemical agents that proved effective. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, octopamine and pilocarpine all countered the maternal affect and permitted the expression of diapause in the flesh fly progeny. [...] The ability to express diapause is an important consideration for forensic entomologists as diapause allows the pupae to become metabollically [...] "dormant" [...] until environmental conditions improve; this would significantly affect pupal time estimations and subsequent post-mortem interval estimations.|$|E
2500|$|Sarcophaga bullata, or {{the grey}} flesh fly, is {{a species of}} fly {{belonging}} to the family Sarcophagidae. It varies in size from small to large, 8 to 17 millimeters in length and is very similar in appearance and behavior to a closely related species, Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis. S. bullata is a common scavenger species in the Eastern United States, but is found throughout the Nearctic region. Identification down to the species level in the Sarcophagidae family is notably difficult and relies primarily on the male genitalia. Though limited information is available regarding S. bullata, it has gained increasing recognition {{in the field of}} forensic entomology as a forensically-relevant fly species, as it may be among the first species to colonize human remains. [...] In these instances, recovered maggots may be analyzed for post-mortem interval (PMI) estimations, which may be used as evidence in courts of law.

Hence, it is poorly understood how natural selection shapes <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> in different ecological circumstances. To overcome this, the current study derives an evolutionary model of <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> in a quantitative genetics context. In constant environments, we show that <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> evolve to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic variance (canalization).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. <b>Maternal</b> <b>effects</b> {{comprise}} {{a class of}} phenotypic effects that parents have on phenotypes of their offspring that are unrelated to the offspring's own genotype. Although biologists have known about the im-portance of these <b>effects</b> for decades, <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> have only recently been studied widely by evolutionary ecologists. Moreover, the impact of <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> on the rate and direction of evolution of other compo-nents of the phenotype has only recently been fully elucidated by theo-retical genetic models. This paper provides {{a brief overview of}} <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> research, focusing on research conducted in animal systems. First, I review and summarize definitions and theoretical treatments of <b>maternal</b> <b>effects.</b> Then I survey the diversity of <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> and some of the kinds of ecological and evolutionary impacts that <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> have been shown to have on offspring performance.

50|$|In genetics, a <b>maternal</b> <b>effect</b> {{occurs when}} the {{phenotype}} of an organism {{is determined by the}} genotype of its mother.

Maternal supply of mRNAs to the early embryo is important, as in many organisms the embryo is initially transcriptionally inactive. Because of the inheritance pattern of <b>maternal</b> <b>effect</b> mutations, special genetic screens are required to identify them.

We find that the rate of environmental fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of M: in slowly changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that M is characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly changing environments favor Ms with dominant eigenvalues that are negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> in which <b>maternal</b> characters influence not only the same character in offspring, but also other offspring characters.

40|$|All organisms live in {{temporally}} fluctuating environments. Theory {{predicts that}} the evolution of deterministic <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e., anticipatory <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> or transgenerational phenotypic plasticity) underlies adaptation to environments that fluctuate in a predictably alternating fashion over maternal-offspring generations. In contrast, randomizing <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e., diversifying and conservative bet-hedging), are expected to evolve in response to unpredictably fluctuating environments. Although <b>maternal</b> <b>effects</b> are common, evidence for their adaptive significance is equivocal since they can easily evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and {{may or may not}} increase the future fitness of offspring. Using the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we here show that the experimental evolution of maternal glycogen provisioning underlies adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environment by increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In strictly alternating environments, we found that hermaphrodites evolved the ability to increase embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced normoxia and to decrease embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced anoxia. At odds with existing theory, however, populations facing irregularly fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environments failed to evolve randomizing <b>maternal</b> <b>effects.</b> Instead, adaptation in these populations may have occurred through the evolution of fitness effects that percolate over multiple generations, as they maintained considerably high expected growth rates during experimental evolution despite evolving reduced fecundity and reduced embryo survival under one or two generations of anoxia.
