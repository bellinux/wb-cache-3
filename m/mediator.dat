5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament <b>Mediator</b> for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The <b>Mediator</b> finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The <b>Mediator</b> is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the <b>Mediator,</b> the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} joint disorder involving cartilage {{destruction and}} joint inflammation. Despite extensive research, still much is unknown on the pathogenesis and aetiology of OA. Inflammation and inflammatory <b>mediators</b> (both local and systemic) are {{key in the}} pathogenesis of OA. For rheumatoid arthritis, multiple therapies are based on targeting the <b>mediators</b> {{that are associated with}} inflammation and joint destruction. Motivated by these findings we set off to identify which inflammatory <b>mediators</b> play a role in OA and whether interfering with these inflammatory <b>mediators</b> could stop OA progression or aid in cartilage repair and regeneration. In this thesis we identified multiple inflammatory <b>mediators</b> and clusters associated with joint inflammation. In a co-culture the <b>mediators</b> produced by OA synovial tissue and cartilage closely resembles the joint environment as measured in OA synovial fluid. Moreover, specific inflammatory <b>mediators</b> produced by the synovial tissue, such as OSM, are capable of slowing down cartilage repair. When the production of inflammatory <b>mediators</b> was decreased by anti-inflammatory drugs or by interference with specific <b>mediators</b> (i. e. OSM), chondrocyte metabolism was affected and cartilage repair improved. We showed that intervention with the production or activity of inflammatory <b>mediators</b> by synovial tissue plays an import role in cartilage metabolism and maybe could stop OA progression...|$|R

40|$|The {{resolution}} of inflammation {{is an active}} process controlled by endogenous <b>mediators</b> with selective actions on neutrophils and monocytes. The initial phase of the acute inflammatory response {{is characterized by the}} production of pro-inflammatory <b>mediators</b> followed by a second phase in which lipid <b>mediators</b> with pro-resolution activities may be generated. The identification of these <b>mediators</b> has provided evidence for the dynamic regulation of the {{resolution of}} inflammation. Among these endogenous local <b>mediators</b> of resolution, lipoxins (LXs), lipid <b>mediators</b> typically formed during cell–cell interaction, were the first to be recognized. More recently, families of endogenous chemical <b>mediators,</b> termed resolvins and protectins, were discovered. LXs and aspirin-triggered LXs are considered to act as ‘braking signals’ in inflammation, limiting the trafficking of leukocytes to the inflammatory site. LXs are actively involved in the resolution of inflammation stimulating non-phlogistic phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Furthermore, LXs have emerged as potential anti-fibrotic <b>mediators</b> that may influence pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix-associated gene expression in response to growth factors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{dissertation}} has been to provide insights into the role of cultural <b>mediators</b> in enhancing patients’ empowerment medical encounters. Specific attention was paid to relations of power between <b>mediators</b> and heath staff understood in terms of the attribution of value to resources of knowledge. The research takes a linguistic ethnographic approach to examining mediation within healthcare settings. Data-gathering techniques included recorded mediated interactions, interviews with healthcare staff and <b>mediators,</b> observations, analysis of hospital documents and visual material. Findings show that <b>mediators</b> have a considerable impact on patients’ empowerment. The data seems to confirm that <b>mediators</b> empower migrant patients in those cases when patients seek information and express concerns. Nevertheless, the research demonstrated that <b>mediators</b> prevent patients’ participation and maintain the status quo of the healthcare system when patients make decisions and express refusals. The findings demonstrate the need to implement training programmes for both healthcare providers and <b>mediators</b> to become more aware of their role of coordinators in the interaction. Additionally, {{there is a need for}} heath staff to attribute a higher value to mediators’ cultural capital and the need for healthcare institutions to recognise <b>mediators</b> as a professional group...|$|R

5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint <b>mediator</b> proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn.

Synovial samples from these patients were subjected to RT-PCR and double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>mediators</b> as well as immune cell markers. Interestingly, pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>mediators</b> were expressed predominantly in granulocytes in patients with JT and in macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells in patients with OA and RA. Interestingly, parallel to the severity of inflammation, proinflammatory <b>mediators</b> IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and 5 -LOX specific mRNA as well as immunoreactive (IR) cells were significantly more abundant in patients with RA and JT than in those with OA. However, anti-inflammatory <b>mediators</b> 15 -LOX, FPR 2, and IL- 10 specific mRNA as well as IR cells were significantly more abundant in patients with OA than in those with JT and RA.
