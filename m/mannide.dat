50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of Freund's adjuvants: Freund’s Complete Adjuvant (FCA) and Freund’s Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA). FCA is a water-in-oil {{emulsion}} that localizes antigen for release periods up to 6 months. It is formulated with mineral oil, the surfactant <b>mannide</b> monoleate and heat killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium butyricum or their extracts (for aggregation of macrophages at the inoculation site). This potent adjuvant stimulates both cell mediated and humoral immunity with preferential induction of antibody against epitopes of denatured proteins. Although FCA has historically been {{the most widely used}} adjuvant, {{it is one of the}} more toxic agents due to non-metabolizable mineral oil and it induces granulomatous reactions. Its use is limited to laboratory animals and it should be used only with weak antigens. It should not be used more than once in a single animal since multiple FCA inoculations can cause severe systemic reactions and decreased immune responses. Freund’s Incomplete Adjuvant has the same formulation as FCA but does not contain mycobacterium or its components. FIA usually is limited to booster doses of antigen since it normally much less effective than FCA for primary antibody induction. Freund’s adjuvants are normally mixed with equal parts of antigen preparations to form stable emulsions.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the biocompatibility of a resin composite subcutaneously implanted in rats with experimentally induced polyarthritis. The testing hypotheses were: (a) there are significant differences in tissue response between healthy rats and rats with experimental arthritis and (b) lower resin composite conversion induces more severe reactions in both groups. Materials and methods: Α hybrid resin composite restorative (Spectrum, Dentsply/ DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany- Shade A 2) was used in the study. Cylindrical molds (O = 2 mm, h = 1. 5 mm) filled with the composite paste were pressed between two transparent glass slides covered with cellulose strips to remove any excess. The specimens were exposed for 10 s (n= 3) and for 40 s (n= 3) to a halogen light-curing unit (Elipar Trilight, 3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) operated in standard irradiation mode at 700 mW/cm 2 light intensity, as verified by an external curing radiometer (Model 100, Demetron Corp., Danbury, CT, USA). The amount of remaining C=C bonds (%RDB) in the irradiated specimens was measured by micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (micro-ATR FTIR). Spectra acquisition was performed on an FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum GX, Perkin-Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK) equipped with a micro-ATR cell (Golden Gate MK II, Specac, Smyrna, GA, USA) operated under the following conditions: 4000 - 600 cm- 1 range, 4 cm- 1 resolution, 20 scans coaddition, 2 mm diamond minicrystal of a single internal reflection, ZnSe lenses and 2 μm depth of analysis at 1000 cm- 1. Spectra were acquired from top (directly irradiated) and bottom specimen surfaces 10 min after irradiation. The %RDB of the tested surfaces was calculated by the two frequency technique using the net peak absorbance areas of C=C stretching vibrations at 1638 cm- 1 as analytical frequency and the aromatic C???C stretching vibrations at 1605 cm- 1 as reference frequency according to the equation: %RDB = AM (C???C) AP X (C=C) / AM (C=C) AP (C???C) ] where AM and AP are the net peak absorbance area ratios of the uncured and cured material, respectively. Statistical analysis of the %RDB per specimen surface and light-curing time was performed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparison test, at an α: 0. 05 significance level. For the animal implantation test, 36 male Wistar rats randomly divided into two groups (n= 18, 270. 0 ± 27. 3 g weigth, 3 - 4 mo age) were used in the study. The animals were housed in a controlled environment and provided with standard rodent chow and water at libitum. The animals were treated in accordance with standard principles. In the first group, induction of arthritis was performed by injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) supplemented with mycobacterium in the right hind paw (1 mg mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Ra/ATCC 25177 heat killed and dried, 0. 85 ml paraffin oil and 0. 15 ml <b>mannide</b> monooleate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). In the animals of the second group (healthy controls), only paraffin oil was injected in the right hind paw. Resin composite specimens were fabricated as described above and irradiated for 10 s (n= 18) and 40 s (n= 18). Calcium hydroxide specimens (n= 18) of the same dimensions were used as control material possessing acceptable biocompatibility. Ten days after the injection and the onset of arthritis, the animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride. Following shaving and disinfecting the animal’s dorsum, subcutaneous pockets were prepared by incisions to a depth of ~ 15 mm. Three pockets were prepared per animal, two for the resin composite specimens (40 s and 10 s exposure) and one for the calcium hydroxide controls. ...|$|E
