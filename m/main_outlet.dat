5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State. In the United States, the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> of this criticism was the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

The first Volvos arrived in the United States in 1955, after hardware wholesaler Leo Hirsh began distributing cars in California. Later, Texas was added, and in 1956, Volvo themselves began importing cars to the US. North America has consistently provided Volvo with their <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> since.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1847 {{the railway}} {{merged with the}} Caledonian Railway and became their <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> to the coast. The Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway opened its branch line on 13 May 1865 with its trains being {{operated}} by the Caledonian Railway, but its steamer operations were slow {{to live up to}} their promise and when in 1869 the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station at Princes Pier, Greenock, the Cathcart Street station was effectively bypassed and the Caley lost trade. They had been trying for some time to organise an extension to Gourock, and having gained Parliamentary approval in 1884 they spent three years in construction which involved extensive tunnelling, and opened Gourock railway station on 1 June 1889. In August 1893 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{literary}} societies at Washington & Jefferson College {{dates back to}} the 1797, when the Franklin Literary Society and the Philo Literary Society were founded at Canonsburg Academy. [...] Two other literary societies were founded at Washington College, the Union Literary Society in 1809 and the Washington Literary Society in 1814. [...] Typical early activities include the presentation of dialogues, translations of passages from Greek or Latin classics, and extemporaneous speaking. [...] Later, the literary societies began to present declamations. [...] Each society maintained independent libraries for the use of their members, each of which rivaled the holdings of their respective colleges. [...] These four college literary societies had intense rivalries with each other, competing in [...] "contests", which pitted select society members against another in [...] "compositions, speaking select orations and debating", with the [...] selecting the victor. [...] Because the two colleges never met each other in athletic contests, these literary competitions were the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> for their rivalry. [...] In the years after the union of the two colleges, these four literary societies merged with the Franklin Literary Society, which survives today.|$|E

2500|$|The Mississippi in the 100-mile-plus stretch {{between the}} port of New Orleans, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico {{frequently}} suffered from silting up of its outlets, stranding ships or making parts of the river unnavigable {{for a period of}} time. Eads solved the problem with a wooden jetty system that narrowed the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> of the river, causing the river to speed up and cut its channel deeper, allowing year-round navigation. Eads offered to build the jetties first, and charge the government later. If he was successful, and the jetties caused the river to cut a channel 30 feet deep for 20 years, the government agreed to pay him $8 million. [...] Eads was successful. [...] The jetty system was installed in 1876 and the channel was cleared in February 1877.|$|E
2500|$|From Isleham to Prickwillow, {{the river}} flows for almost [...] in an {{artificial}} cut, {{thought to have}} been constructed by the Romans, and joined the River Great Ouse at Prickwillow until 1830. The Great Ouse was then diverted, and its old course occupied by the Lark. There are a number of pumping stations on the banks of this section, including the Lark Engine, which has been the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> for the drainage of the southern part of Burnt Fen since 1842. Many of the surrounding ditches once flowed into the river by gravity, but the draining of the fens has resulted in the land surface dropping, and the water must now be raised by up to [...] from the ditches to the river. At Mile End, two pumping stations sit one above the other, indicating the progressive sinking of the land. Prickwillow is home to the Museum of Fen Pumping Engines, itself once a working pumping station, and now holding several engines which were used in the draining of the Fens.|$|E

2500|$|In 1763, landowners {{decided that}} the carrs {{to the east of}} the River Hull could be turned into {{profitable}} land, and obtained an Act of Parliament to exclude this area from the jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers. It created Holderness Drainage, a legal entity with powers to construct new banks and drains. Plans for the drainage of Holderness were then put together. John Grundy, Jr. was approached to produce plans for the drainage of some [...] of low-lying land to the east of the River Hull. He worked with John Smeaton on the initial assessment, and the two men visited the area in November. There was significant opposition to his plans for the <b>main</b> <b>outlet</b> to be at Marfleet, since the shipping owners felt that the scouring action of the fresh water on the mud banks near {{the lower end of the}} Hull was vital to maintain the Old Harbour, as this part of the river was known. With limited financial resources, Holderness Drainage were unable to resist the pressure, and the plans were altered to have an outlet at Stoneferry on the Hull, and reduced dimensions for the drains. Grundy wrote the final report, completing it on 30 December. Smeaton then reviewed it, and suggested only minor modifications, as he was happy with all the major points. The land surveyor Charles Tate produced an engraved plan, and Grundy went to London to steer the bill for the scheme through Parliament. The bill became an Act of Parliament on 5 April 1764.|$|E
