25|$|On the South Col, climbers {{enter the}} death zone. Climbers making summit bids {{typically}} can endure no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three days at this altitude.

If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many {{all the way back}} down to Base Camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} these {{combined}} causes {{is shown in the}} character of the seasons. Fogs are frequent, especially during the summer; frosts do not occur until the middle of October; ice forms on raised surfaces at least once a winter; snows are frequently light, seldom remaining on the ground <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three days, except in the higher elevations. The average rainfall is about fifty-three inches, which is pretty uniformly distributed throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis is most {{commonly}} caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Typically, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three alcoholic drinks per day {{over a number}} of years is required for alcoholic cirrhosis to occur. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes, including being overweight, diabetes, high blood fats, and high blood pressure. A number of less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, certain medications, and gallstones. Diagnosis is based on blood testing, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.|$|E

25|$|Occasional warm days {{in winter}} are {{critical}} for honey bee survival; dysentery problems increase in likelihood during periods of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three weeks with temperatures below 50°F (10°C). When cleansing flights are few, bees will often be forced out at times when the temperature is barely adequate for their wing muscles to function, and large quantities of bees may be seen dead in the snow around the hives. Colonies found dead in spring from dysentery will have feces smeared over the frames and other hive parts.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely de novo identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.|$|E
25|$|After {{the above}} process, the yerba may be brewed. If the straw is {{inserted}} into dry yerba, the mate {{must first be}} filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three minutes). Treating the yerba with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the yerba mate from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown {{of some of its}} desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the yerba, until it reaches almost {{to the top of the}} gourd when the yerba is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the yerba beside the edge of the gourd's opening.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
500|$|Professor Alan Watson, a British {{forensic}} pathologist, {{carried out}} a post-mortem examination of the bodies. Watson arrived in Gibraltar {{the day after the}} shootings, by which time the bodies had been taken to the Royal Navy Hospital; he found that the bodies had been stripped of their clothing (causing difficulties in distinguishing entry and exit wounds), that the mortuary had no X-ray machine (which would have allowed Watson to track the paths of the bullets through the bodies), and that he was refused access to any other X-ray machine. After the professor returned to his home in Scotland, he was refused access to the results of blood tests and other evidence which had been sent for analysis and was dissatisfied with the photographs taken by the Gibraltar Police photographer who had assisted him. At the inquest, McGrory noted and questioned the lack of assistance given to the pathologist, which Watson told him was [...] "a puzzle". Watson concluded that McCann had been shot four times—once in the jaw (possibly a ricochet), once in the head, and twice in the back; Farrell was shot five times (twice in the face and three times in the back). Watson was unable to determine exactly how many times Savage was shot—he estimated that it was possibly as many as eighteen times. McGrory asked Watson whether the pathologist would agree that Savage's body was [...] "riddled with bullets"; Watson's answer made headlines the following morning: [...] "I concur with your word. Like a frenzied attack". Watson agreed that the evidence suggested the deceased were shot while on the ground; a second pathologist called by McGrory offered similar findings. Two weeks later, the court heard from David Pryor—a forensic scientist working for London's Metropolitan Police—who had analysed the clothes of the dead; he told the inquest his analysis had been hampered by the condition of the clothing when it arrived. Pryor offered evidence contradictory to that given by Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] about their proximity to McCann and Farrell when they opened fire—the soldiers claimed they were at least six feet (1.8 metres) away, but Pryor's analysis was that McCann and Farrell were shot from a distance of no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three feet (0.6 or 0.9 metres).|$|E

When the values form a Boolean algebra (which may have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> even infinitely many values), many-valued logic reduces to classical logic; many-valued logics are therefore only of independent interest when the values form an algebra that is not Boolean.|$|E

[...] A week or so prior the Test, however, Read had shared in a 158-run partnership against the tourists with fellow professional and England player Billy Barnes.

However, we do not believe that something that is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way.
