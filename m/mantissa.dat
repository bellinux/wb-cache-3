25|$|All {{floating}} point operations are largely implemented in microcode across {{the family and}} thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit {{floating point}} operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and <b>mantissa,</b> thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times {{as effective as the}} one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).|$|E

Because {{of the way}} the processor was designed, it uses Reverse Polish notation (RPN) for inputting calculations. RPN meant that the difficult implementation of brackets, and the associated recursive logic, was not necessary to implement in the hardware, but the effort was instead offloaded to the user. Instead of an [...] "Equals" [...] button, there is an [...] "Enter" [...] button that tells the calculator when a value has been entered, and then the operators are entered in after the operands. For example, on some devices to evaluate [...] "(1+2) x 3", the sequence entered would be [...] "3 enter 2 enter 1 + x." [...] The Sinclair Scientific entry procedure is slightly different as it lacks an enter key and has a limited number of internal registers.|$|E

500|$|Of Stearn's {{writings}} on Linnaeus, the most well known is his {{edition of the}} 1753 Species plantarum, published in facsimile by the Ray Society in 1957, for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix. Concerned that Linnaeus' methods were imperfectly understood by his contemporaries, Stearn wrote that his introduction [...] "provided concisely all the information about his [...] life, herbaria, publications, methodology etc. which a botanical taxonomist needs to know". The Times stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what {{is considered one of}} the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus. Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including Genera Plantarum, <b>Mantissa</b> plantarum and [...] Later, he would produce a bicentenary guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society.|$|E

25|$|Formann {{provided}} an alternative explanation by directing {{attention to the}} interrelation between {{the distribution of the}} significant digits and the distribution of the observed variable. He showed in a simulation study that long right-tailed distributions of a random variable are compatible with the Newcomb-Benford law, and that for distributions of the ratio of two random variables the fit generally improves. For numbers drawn from certain distributions (IQ scores, human heights) the Law fails to hold because these variates obey a normal distribution which is known not to satisfy Benford's law, since normal distributions can't span several orders of magnitude and the <b>mantissae</b> of their logarithms will not be (even approximately) uniformly distributed.|$|R
40|$|Benford's law {{states that}} in {{randomly}} collected numbers certain digits {{are more often}} leading digits than others. More formally: the general law states that the <b>mantissae</b> follow the logarithmic distribution in any base. Benford's law was recognized by many mathematicians so that several possible explanations have been derived, but several questions are still open. Applications are widespread, for example an auditing technique (the so-called digital analysis), which is employed around the world by internal revenue services to detect tax fraud, is based on this phenomenon. In this paper it will be shown that there exists no probability measure that would obey Benford's law for any base, but if the set of possible bases does not exceed a given upper limit, most real-life distributions obey, or can be transformed to obey Benford's law. ...|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{by giving}} a meaning to "The {{probability}} that a random integer has initial digit d", we define a URI-set as a random set E of natural integers such that each n> 0 belongs to E with probability 1 /n, independently of other integers. This enables us to introduce two notions of densities on natural numbers: The URI-density, obtained by averaging along the elements of E, and the local URI-density, which we get by considering the k-th element of E and letting k go to infinity. We prove that the elements of E satisfy Benford's law, both {{in the sense of}} URI-density and in the sense of local URI-density. Moreover, if b_ 1 and b_ 2 are two multiplicatively independent integers, then the <b>mantissae</b> of a natural number in base b_ 1 and in base b_ 2 are independent. Connections of URI-density and local URI-density with other well-known notions of densities are established: Both are stronger than the natural density, and URI-density is equivalent to log-density. We also give a stochastic interpretation, in terms of URI-set, of the H_∞-density...|$|R

A computer using base sixteen would require a larger table, but one using base two would require only three entries: the possible bits of the integer part of {{the adjusted}} <b>mantissa</b> are 01 (the power being even so there was no shift, remembering that a normalised floating point number always has a non-zero high-order digit) or if the power was odd, 10 or 11, these being the first two bits of the original <b>mantissa.</b> Thus, 6.25 = 110.01 in binary, normalised to 1.1001 x 22 an even power so the paired bits of the <b>mantissa</b> are 01, while [...]625 = 0.101 in binary normalises to 1.01 x 2−1 an odd power so the adjustment is to 10.1 x 2−2 and the paired bits are 10. Notice that the low order bit of the power is echoed in the high order bit of the pairwise <b>mantissa.</b> An even power has its low-order bit zero and the adjusted <b>mantissa</b> will start with 0, whereas for an odd power that bit is one and the adjusted <b>mantissa</b> will start with 1.
