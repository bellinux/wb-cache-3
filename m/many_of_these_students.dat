Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Match Game {{kept its}} high {{standing}} in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show's time slot. Noting a ratings boon resulted when The Price Is Right and Match Game were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that The Price Is Right had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved Match Game to 11:00 a.m., immediately following The Price Is Right at 10:00 a.m. However, because much of Match Games audience was composed of students who were in school {{at that time of}} day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> did not return. As a result, Family Feud quickly supplanted Match Game as television's highest-rated game show.|$|E

25|$|Many {{students}} {{listen to}} music while they study. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> maintain that the reasons why they {{listen to music}} are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E
500|$|Lucien Lucius Nunn was an American {{industrialist}} and entrepreneur {{involved in}} the early electrification of the mining industry. To staff the power plants he built, including ones in Colorado and the Olmsted Station Powerhouse in Provo, Utah, Nunn created an early work study program, which he named 'Telluride Institute' after his city of residence of Telluride, Colorado. In the Institute, Nunn's students were trained in engineering and the liberal arts. Upon completion of their institute program, the student workers were sent to various academic institutions on a scholarship from Nunn to further their education. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> went on to study at Cornell University's engineering programs. On Cornell University's campus in Ithaca, Nunn built the Telluride House as a scholarship residence [...] "for bright young men", {{many of whom have}} passed through Nunn’s Telluride Institute.|$|E
500|$|A further eleven {{courses were}} run {{during the war}} years, graduating 152 pilots to a basic flying standard. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> {{would go on to}} play a {{prominent}} role in the future Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including Bill Anderson, Harry Cobby, Adrian Cole, Frank McNamara, Lawrence Wackett, and Henry Wrigley. The AFC's first unit to see active service, the Mesopotamian Half Flight, was raised under Petre's command and departed for the Middle East in April 1915; Petre's fellow pilots included CFS graduates White and Merz. Harrison took over the school's leadership in Petre's absence. The facilities were improved, {{and by the end of}} 1915, according to Wackett, they boasted [...] "a good engineering workshop", [...] "cottages for the married staff" [...] and [...] "a very comfortable officers mess". A year later, three AFC squadrons had been formed at Point Cook for service in the Middle East and France: Nos.1, 3 and 4 Squadrons. In September 1918 the school, now made up of No.1 Home Training Squadron, No.1 Home Training Depot, and an aircraft repair section, became part of the Australian Imperial Force. Harrison was posted overseas in October and Major William Sheldon, former commanding officer of Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons, was placed in charge of CFS. [...] Little training took place in the year following the November 1918 Armistice; staff mainly did [...] "odd jobs" [...] such as making survey flights and promoting government bonds. CFS's units were disbanded in December 1919 and the school taken over by the short-lived Australian Air Corps, formed on 1January 1920. In 1921, CFS's function was assumed by No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), a unit of the newly formed RAAF.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the home school movement, Dr. Cynthia Bower taught phonics classes to groups of home school mothers in the summer, and the school began {{providing}} the service of annual achievement testing. The school’s philosophical stand has always been that parents are primarily responsible for the education of their own children. Believing this, CHA developed programs to equip parents to teach and to give them educational support. Out of this was born the Home School Satellite Program. The emphasis of the program has always been on preparation of the parent to teach, but there have been opportunities for students to participate in some school events and/or classes. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> have found their way into the CHA day school program because of this association.|$|E

For example, a previous study did show that students with DCV exposure were less likely to perceive that particles stopped moving at equilibrium (Sanger et al. 2001). However, assessment items that include concrete, dynamic representation of abstract concepts (Wu et al. 2010) and incorporate essential variables that could draw attention to the target mechanism (Smetana and Bell 2012) are relatively scarce.|$|R

2500|$|Political Economy was {{introduced}} in American anthropology primarily through the support of Julian Steward, a student of Kroeber. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, {{and the organization of}} work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at Columbia University. [...] At this time, Columbia saw an influx of World War II veterans who were attending school thanks to the GI Bill. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, Eleanor Leacock, Roy Rappaport, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, Morton Fried, Robert F. Murphy, and influenced other scholars such as Elman Service, Marvin Harris and June Nash. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in Puerto Rico.|$|E
