40|$|Illusory self-motion (‘vection’) {{in depth}} is {{strongly}} enhanced when horizontal/vertical simulated viewpoint oscillation {{is added to}} optic flow inducing displays; a similar effect is found for simulated viewpoint jitter. The underlying cause of these oscillation and jitter advantages for vection is still unknown. Here we investigate the possibility that perceived speed of motion in depth (MID) plays a role. First, in a 2 AFC procedure, we obtained <b>MID</b> <b>speed</b> PSEs for briefly presented (vertically oscillating and smooth) radial flow displays. Then we examined the strength, duration and onset latency of vection induced by oscillating and smooth radial flow displays matched either for simulated or perceived <b>MID</b> <b>speed.</b> The oscillation advantage was eliminated when displays were matched for perceived <b>MID</b> <b>speed.</b> However, when we tested the jitter advantage in the same manner, jittering displays were found to produce greater vection in depth than speed-matched controls. In summary, jitter and oscillation advantages were the same across experiments, but slower <b>MID</b> <b>speed</b> was required to match jittering than oscillating stimuli. Thus, {{to the extent that}} vection is driven by perceived speed of MID, this effect is greater for oscillating than for jittering stimuli, which suggests that the two effects may arise from separat...|$|E

Only binocular cues to MID were available: changing disparity and interocular velocity difference (IOVD). Perceived speed for monocular lateral motion and perceived depth for static disparity were also assessed, again in both central and peripheral vision. The purpose of the experiment {{was to assess the}} relative contributions of changing disparity and IOVD cues to the perceived speed of stereomotion. Although peripheral stimuli appeared to lie at approximately the same depth as their central counterparts, their apparent speed was reduced. Monocular/lateral and binocular/MID speeds were reduced to a similar extent. It seems that reduced apparent monocular speed leads to reduced perceived <b>MID</b> <b>speed,</b> {{despite the fact that the}} disparity system appears to be unaffected. These results suggest that the IOVD cue makes a significant contribution to <b>MID</b> <b>speed</b> perception...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an engine with constant power for SAE’s student Formula race-car competition, allowing the avoidance of gear shifting {{for much of the}} Autocross event. To achieve constant power for over 50 % of the speed range, turbocharging was adopted with a boost pressure ratio of 2. 8 at mid-range speeds and applied to an engine capacity of 430 cc. This engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. The capacity was selected to minimise frictional losses and thus increase delivered power along with dry sump lubrication and a three speed gear box. The engine manifolds and plenums were designed using a CAE application and proved to be well suited to the task resulting in excellent agreement between predicted and actual performance. One of the major challenges of the experimental development was overcoming the turbocharger oil consumption under throttled operation at part load conditions and at full power when the FSAE restrictor is choked. For the 2004 Australian competition the engine was run with slightly reduced <b>mid</b> <b>speed</b> power to avoid excessive use of the traction control system and was very competitive finishing first in the fuel economy event.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the Journal of Automobile Engineering: [URL] is a novel approach that can better utilize the energy recoverable by a turbine (or series of turbines) mounted in the exhaust flow of internal combustion engines. The recovery of blowdown pulse energy in isolation of displacement pulse energy allows the discharging (depressurization) of the exhaust system to reduce engine pumping work and improve engine fuel economy. This is a novel approach to air system optimization that has previously been studied for naturally aspirated engines. However, to be successful, turbo-discharging should be applicable to turbocharged engines, as downsizing is a promising direction for future powertrain systems. This study uses one-dimensional gas dynamics modelling to explore the effect of turbo-discharging on a turbocharged gasoline engine, particularly focusing on the interaction with the turbocharging system. The {{results show that the}} peak engine torque is increased at low to <b>mid</b> <b>speeds</b> with high speed torque slightly reduced due to restrictions in engine breathing with low lift exhaust valves. The engine peak torque as a function of speed with a larger turbocharger and turbo-discharging was comparable to that of the smaller turbocharger without turbo-discharging.

40|$|With varying {{fuel costs}} and the {{pressure}} from International Maritime Organizations(IMO) Energy Efficient Design Index(EEDI) regulations regarding CO 2 emissions, new economical and environmentally-friendly technologies are becoming {{an integral part of}} ship design. Vessels today face a broad spectrum of operating conditions, as they must take on a broad variety of trades, and one aspect of this is variation in sailing speed. The variation in operating conditions due to both long and short term effects in the global economy opens an untapped potential for further fuel savings, by introducing a flexible bulb that could adopt to the change in operating conditions in real time. This thesis aims to investigate the value of bulbous bows that can reconfigure the length during transit from a hydrodynamic point of view. To fit merchant vessels with bulbous bows to reduce the total resistance of the hull is customary practice. Although the bulbs differ in terms of shape and size for the different vessel segments, the primary objective is to reduce the ships wave resistance, by generating a wave that interferes with the wave generated by the hull, resulting in a minimization the wave resistance. As ship owners have reacted to how ship speeds correlates to the state of the global economy, recent developments have been towards designing the bulb for a broader range of operating conditions. This design strategy is known as robust design, and is essentially suboptimal for each speed scenario. However, based on the variety of operating conditions ships are facing, the strategy is superior to optimizing the bulb for a fixed service speed. The introduction of the flexibility to the bulb design is an active method of creating value, contrasting the standard passive robust design approach. Large scale effects such as the wave making of the vessel is mostly unaffected by viscous effects, and this supports the use of a potential flow code to evaluate the wave resistance of the hull. By evaluating the difference in wave resistance for the different length configurations of the flexible bulb, the potential of such a device can be stated. The potential flow code SHIPFLOW is used to rank the different bulb design modifications with respect to hydrodynamic performance. The design procedure of the flexible bulbous bow is divided in two stages. The first stage is to analyze Automatic Identification System(AIS) data for a reference vessel to establish an applicable operating profile for the design model. The operating profile for the reference vessel ANL BAREGA was obtained from a study carried out in parallel, which has the objective of analyzing AIS data for the global fleet to identify the fuel savings from being able to reconfigure the bulb during transit. The second stage of the design cycle consists of an optimization procedure of the flexible bulb geometry, with respect to reduction in the weighted effective power over the operating profile. The optimization of the flexible bulb configuration is a process which is divided into four separate parts. Firstly, the length, breadth and height parameters of the bulb geometry is parametrized with the use of parametric B-spline curves and surfaces. Parameterization with B-spline curves and surfaces hold the desired ability to morph the bulb geometry in an effective and efficient manner while retaining the typical bulb shape, with the movement of a set of control points on the bulb surface. The parameterization is derived and implemented within the workbench of the CAESES framework. The second part constitutes a search of the design space to identify the influence of the design parameters on the wave resistance for the various speeds in the operating profile. Furthermore, this part will establish a set of flexible bulb geometry candidates to be studied later in the optimization procedure. The third part of the optimization procedure is to establish a robust optimized bulb configuration {{with the use of a}} particle swarm optimization algorithm implemented in MATLAB. This bulb design will be used as reference for the flexible bulb, since it is industry standard. The last part consists of evaluating the flexible bulb candidates with a change in the length parameter. The performance of the flexible bulb configurations and the robust bulb configuration are compared establish the potential of flexibility in the bulb design. To validate the design method and estimates the value of having a reconfigurable bulb, a case study on the KRISO container ship(KCS) coupled with the operating profile of the comparable container ship ANL BAREGA is presented. The results from the case study indicated a clear trend which states that the potential of flexibility in the bulb design is largely governed by the breadth parameter in the lower to <b>mid</b> <b>speed</b> regime, while in the higher speed regime the length parameter is the governing factor. As a result, the best flexible bulb configuration yielded a reduction in the weighted effective power of 0. 22 %. The reduction is too small to account for the assumed affiliated additional costs, leaving limited incentives for such a configuration to be implemented in ship design...|$|E

50|$|Sequential turbos {{refer to}} a set-up in which the motor uses one {{turbocharger}} for lower engine speeds, and a second or both turbochargers at higher engine speeds. Typically, larger high-flow turbochargers are not as efficient at low RPM, resulting in lower intake manifold pressures under these conditions. On the other hand, smaller turbos spool up quickly at low RPM but cannot supply enough air at higher engine speed. During low to <b>mid</b> engine <b>speeds,</b> when available spent exhaust energy is minimal, only one relatively small turbocharger (called the primary turbocharger) is active. During this period, all of the engine's exhaust energy is directed to the primary turbocharger only, providing the small turbo's benefits of a lower boost threshold, minimal turbo lag, and increased power output at low engine speeds. As RPM increases, the secondary turbocharger is partially activated in order to pre-spool prior to its full utilization. Once a preset engine speed or boost pressure is attained, valves controlling compressor and turbine flow through the secondary turbocharger are opened completely. (The primary turbocharger is deactivated {{at this point in}} some applications.) In this way a full twin-turbocharger setup provides the benefits associated with a large turbo, including maximum power output, without the disadvantage of increased turbo lag.|$|R
40|$|The Gasoline Direct Injection {{engines are}} an {{important}} source of ultra-fine particulate matter. Significant research effort is still required as improved understanding of soot formation is critical in considering further development or adoption of new technologies. Experimental measurements of engine-out soot emissions have been taken from a modern Euro IV GDI engine at part-load operating conditions. The engine speed and torque were varied in the range 1600 – 3700 rev/min, and 30 – 120 Nm, respectively. The engine was invariably operated in stoichiometric and homogeneous combustion mode, with fuel injection early in the intake stroke. The results indicate that for engine load in excess of 3 bar Brake Mean Effective Pressure, due to incomplete gas-phase mixture preparation, a consistent linear correlation establishes between combustion duration and soot particle number. On average, a sixfold increase in number concentration between 1. 0 and 6. 0 × 106 particle per cc, arises from shortening the rapid duration of 4 crank angle degrees. For engine speed in excess of 3000 rev/min and load in excess of 7 bar BMEP, this correlation appears to be superseded by the effects of spray-to-piston impingement and consequent pool-fire. Three main areas of concern have been identified within the part-load running envelope: (1) the higher load-lower speed range and (2) the <b>mid</b> load-mid <b>speed</b> range, where high nucleation rates induce copious increases of engine-out soot mass; (3) the upper part-load range where, most likely as a result of spray impingement, high levels of soot concentration (up to 10 million particles per cc) are emitted with very small size (23 – 40 nm) ...|$|R

The curve {{breaks in the}} direction of the pitcher's arm travel from the point of release on through the entire arc of its flight. If one were to look at a clock a straight drop curveball would be 12-6. A right hander with slightly more lateral break will have a curveball breaking in a 1-7 manner or with more lateral movement in a 2-8 manner. A left hander that throws a curveball with more lateral break will either have an 11-5 or 10-4 curveball. Curveballs travel from the low 60s to <b>mid</b> 80s in <b>speed.</b> The other soft curveball is the screwball, which is essentially a reverse curve ball, as it breaks in the opposite direction of the pitcher's arm travel. The screwball is a fairly rare pitch in modern baseball, due in part to a widespread belief that it causes damage to the arm. However, a 2014 New York Times investigation concluded that this belief is unfounded, and that the screwball causes no more injury than any other pitch.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} oxygenated neat palm biodiesel in a direct injection single cylinder diesel engine in terms of ignition, combustion and emissions characteristics. Conventional non-oxygenated diesel fuel is compared as baseline. The engine testing is performed between the operating speed of 2000 - 3000 rpm and load of up to 3 bar of brake mean effective pressure. From it, a total of 50 experiment cases are tested to form a comprehensive operational speed-load contour map for ignition and combustion; while various engine-out emissions such as NO, CO, UHCs and CO 2 are compared based on fuel type-speed combinations. The ignition and combustion evolution contour maps quantify the absolute ignition delay period and elucidate the difference between that of palm biodiesel and fossil diesel. Although diesel has shorter ignition delay period by up to 0. 6 CAD at 3000 rpm and burns more rapidly {{at the start of}} combustion, combustion of palm biodiesel accelerates during the mid-combustion phase and overtakes diesel in the cumulative heat release rates (HRR) prior to the 90 % cumulative HRR. This {{can be attributed to the}} oxygen contained in palm biodiesel assisting in localized regions of combustion. In terms of performance, the oxygenated nature of palm biodiesel provided mixed performances with improved thermal efficiency and increased brake specific fuel consumption, due to the improved combustion and lower calorific values, respectively. Emission measurements show that NO for palm biodiesel is lower compared to diesel at low and <b>mid</b> operating <b>speed</b> by up to 36. 8 %, which can be attributed to the lower combustion temperature. Other emissions such as CO, UHCs and CO 2 showed similar emissions output for the two fuels.

Both MC III of 8 clinically normal horses were divided in 9 sites (lateral, medial, dorsal aspect; proximal, <b>mid,</b> distal level). <b>Speed</b> of sound (SOS) measurements were performed with a QUS multisite device (Sunlight Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) and a DXA device (Hologic Inc., Bedford, USA) was used to evaluate cortical bone mineral density (BMD) at each site. Ex vivo data on MC III were analysed with a mixed model to test the hypothesis of no difference between aspect and level in QUS and DXA while adjusting for fixed member and for random horse effects. Pearson correlation coefficients between SOS and BMD obtained on MC III with soft tissue were calculated for each member and site. A mixed model was used to determine whether there is a difference between in vivo and ex vivo SOS data while adjusting for fixed aspect, level, and member and random horse effects. Highly significant (p 0. 05). The study suggests that, in horses, SOS results can not be explained only by BMD, but could reflect additional properties of bone, such as elasticity, architecture or bone strength.

The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines.

40|$|The Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) {{created a}} {{standard}} {{to specify the}} procedure for sound quality testing of mechanical ventilation equipment. This standard contained a procedure for performance, reliability, and accuracy based on a full assembly loudness assessment. This thesis provides a new generic component loudness assessment procedure that can be utilized to identify and reduce the noise radiating from kitchen range hoods based on an individual component loudness assessment. With these evaluations, design improvements are implemented to help reduce the outgoing noise from the range hood that may cause hearing loss or high stress. Four different range hoods were tested across the 24 - 1 / 3 octave frequency bands using the new component loudness assessment procedure. The kitchen range hoods tested include two centrifugal-flow fans and two axial-flow fans for ventilation. Each range hood includes basic component design differences in the damper, grille, and enclosure. The results show that {{in all but one}} case the damper caused an increase in the overall loudness by 10 % at high speed and as much as 70 % at low speed. In addition it has been observed that the addition of the grille can either reduce the loudness or increase the loudness depending on design features. Using the information gathered from the component loudness assessment, practical low-cost noise attenuation techniques are formulated and implemented in order to reduce overall loudness. The primary goal of noise attenuation (or noise reduction) is to diminish the overall loudness to a comfortable level. Using the techniques formulated, vibration and aerodynamic induced noise have been reduced across all speeds of the range hood by as much as 15 %. The greatest reduction was observed at high speed with a reduction of 2. 17 sones, while <b>mid</b> and low <b>speed</b> were able to archive a reduction of 0. 89 sones and 1 sone respectively.
