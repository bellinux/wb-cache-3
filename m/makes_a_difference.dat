25|$|RFID tags can {{be either}} passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an {{on-board}} battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission. That <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in interference and in exposure to radiation.|$|E

The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the negative solution for higher dimensions, {{comes from the fact that}} the Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two, and is not solvable for higher dimensions.

[...] Rollins' season was {{characterized}} by a strong first half, and a [...] "sophomore jinx" [...] at the plate that plagued him {{in the second half of}} the season. For his performance in the early months of the season, he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All-Star game, in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever to reach the game in each of his first two seasons. After the all-star game, however, he struggled at the plate, striking out frequently and chasing many high pitches that were out of the strike zone. Ultimately, Rollins finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled a [...]980 fielding percentage (second in NL), 695 total chances (third in NL), 504 assists (fourth in NL), and 226 putouts (fifth in NL). Meanwhile, offensively, he regressed from his 2001 campaign, posting a [...]245 batting average with 11 home runs, but still leading the NL with 10 triples; he stole 31 bases, 15 fewer than he did in 2001. After the season, he participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.|$|E
500|$|Peters {{was born}} in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He began riding at age seven, and {{competing}} in weekend dressage shows. By 15, he was competing outside of Germany, at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark. He received his first horse, Udon, at age 16 as a gift from his father; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1984, he spent the summer training in San Diego, California, before returning to Germany to perform his army service. In 1985, {{he returned to the}} United States with Udon. In 1991, he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor, Lila Kommerstad, who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters' Arroyo Del Mar training barn. Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992, saying, [...] "The whole idea of being so patriotic, of feeling so close to one's country <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> There are not too many other countries where the people are so patriotic. I really enjoy this about America." [...] Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife, Shannon. Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012, around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders. Outside of his competition and training schedule, he teaches in around 30 training seminars each year. His staff call him [...] "a machine" [...] with regard to his training and competition schedule, and in addition to riding, he participates in swimming, cycling and tennis.|$|E

2500|$|Textbooks and {{dictionaries}} {{indicate the}} length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, {{but it is not}} generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to the sense, for instance Româ [...] ('from Rome' ablative) compared to Roma [...] ('Rome' nominative). Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be [...] redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they never heard it spoken aloud.|$|E
2500|$|Frustration {{is another}} {{major cause of}} {{aggression}}. The Frustration aggression theory states that aggression increases if a person feels {{that he or she}} is being blocked from achieving a goal (Aronson et al. 2005). One study found that the closeness to the goal <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> The study examined people waiting in line and concluded that the 2nd person was more aggressive than the 12th one when someone cut in line (Harris 1974). Unexpected frustration may be another factor. In a separate study to demonstrate how unexpected frustration leads to increased aggression, Kulik & Brown (1979) [...] selected a group of students as volunteers to make calls for charity donations. One group was told that the people they would call would be generous and the collection would be very successful. The other group was given no expectations. The group that expected success was more upset when no one was pledging than the group who did not expect success (everyone actually had horrible success). This research suggests that when an expectation does not materialize (successful collections), unexpected frustration arises which increases aggression.|$|E

2500|$|At first glance, Schiller appears {{very similar}} to James. However, Schiller’s more {{stringent}} requirement that meaningful statements have consequences [...] "to some one for some purpose" [...] makes Schiller’s position more extreme than James’. For Schiller, {{it is not a}} sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person’s goals at a specific moment in time {{if it is to be}} meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and the statement [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to someone’s purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and then [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Sanders situates open theism {{as a form}} of freewill theism {{which goes}} back to the early church fathers and in Protestantism, it is {{prominent}} in the Arminian-Wesleyan traditions. In freewill theism God does not micromanage the creation, {{as is the case in}} theological determinism, but instead exercises “general sovereignty” by which God enacts the overarching structures in which creatures operate. Humans have libertarian free will such that for a free act the individual could have acted differently from reality. God does not determine or tightly control what humans do which means that God takes risks that humans might do things (likebsin) that God does not want them to do. The divine will, for some things, can be thwarted. Freewill theists have emphasized reciprocal relations between humans and God when it comes to salvation and prayer. They believe that God graciously initiates the call to redemption by granting enabling grace but that humans are free to accept it or reject it. When believers petition God in prayer what the believer prays can have an effect on God. Some divine decisions are contingent upon our actions. In other words, God responds to what creatures do, and what happens in history <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to the way God acts in history. When such ideas are applied to the divine attributes, freewill theists reject “strong” divine immutability (God cannot change in any respect) and “strong” impassibility (God cannot be affected by what creatures do). Freewill theists do affirm “weak” impassibility (God is not overcome by emotions as humans are apt to be) and “weak” immutability (the divine nature [...] never changes).|$|E
