5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called <b>mesothelioma</b> (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal <b>mesothelioma,</b> and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
40|$|Female rats {{were treated}} twice by an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of mineral fibres. The treatment led to malignant tumours in the peritoneal cavity. Most of these tumours {{were classified as}} malignant <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Some rats had undifferentiated sarcomas rather than <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Three different types of malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> can be distinguished: epithelioid, sarcomatoid and mixed.

Some of the affected persons were known to have been exposed to asbestos (Goldstein, 1979; Yousem and Hochholzer, 1987). In the following report histopathological features of malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> occurring in the abdominal cavity after intraperitoneal injection of different types of mineral fibres in female Wistar rats are described.

Three <b>mesotheliomas</b> and no lymphomas were found among 24 animals injected in the same way with talc during the same time (12. 5 %). In 46 control animals injected with physiological saline three <b>mesotheliomas</b> and one lymphoma were seen (8. 7 %).

40|$|The {{intermediate}} filament cytoskeleton of epithelial, biphasic, and fibrous malignant pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> was {{studied by}} immunohistochemistry and gel electrophoresis. The results {{were compared with}} data similarly obtained from lung adenocarcinomas. All <b>mesotheliomas</b> immunostained with various monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against cytokeratins. By double immunofluorescence microscopy, coexpression of cytokeratins and vimentin {{was found in the}} fusiform cells of biphasic and fibrous <b>mesotheliomas.</b> As determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, lung adenocarcinomas exclusively expressed Cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, and 19, and the same polypeptides were found in the fibrous <b>mesotheliomas.</b> These four cytokeratins were also found in the epithelial and biphasic <b>mesotheliomas,</b> most of which, however, also expressed, additional cytokeratins, such as the basic Polypeptide 5 and, in some cases, Cytokeratins 4, 6, 14, and 17. The results demonstrate the epithelial nature of all types of malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> and thus justify their classification as carcinomas. When epithelial morphology is evident, the pattern of cytokeratin expression is usually more complex, as indicated by the synthesis, in addition to the "simple epithelial" pattern (7, 8, 18, and 19), of certain cytokeratin polypeptides which hitherto have been presumed to be typical of stratified epithelia. This cytokeratin complexity and the coexpression of vimentin and cytokeratins in certain forms of <b>mesotheliomas</b> indicate that these tumors are a clearly distinct and complex group of carcinomas. Their special cytoskeletal filament protein expression should prove useful in differentiating <b>mesotheliomas</b> from other carcinomas, particularly from adenocarcinomas growing in the lung...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of studies to {{elucidate}} the relative contribution of simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T and small t proteins during oncogenesis, we observed the appearance of pericardial and pleural tumors in 100 % of Syrian hamsters injected in the pleural space with wild type SV 40. When SV 40 was injected via the intracardiac or intraperitoneal routes, more than 50 % of hamsters developed mesothelial tumors. Macroscopic, microscopic, ultramicroscopic, and histochemical characteristics identify these neoplasms and derived cell lines as <b>mesotheliomas</b> and mesothelioma-derived cell lines. The SV 40 genome was integrated and expressed in the <b>mesotheliomas</b> and derived cell lines. The absence of <b>mesotheliomas</b> in hamsters injected with SV 40 small t deletion mutants indicates that the small t protein {{plays an important role}} in the development of SV 40 -induced <b>mesotheliomas.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first definitive report of virus-induced <b>mesotheliomas</b> in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> are tumors {{known for}} their {{extensive}} heterogeneity. Apart from the three classical patterns, predominantly epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic, some rare variants do exist. In some cases, one can find uncommon additional mesodermal tumor components. These tumors have previously been called “mesodermomas” and, like regular <b>mesotheliomas,</b> are usually associated with a previous asbestos exposure. We examined eight cases of mesodermomas by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Besides biphasic and epithelioid areas, unusual epithelial, chondroid, osseous, or even angioblastic elements may be found to varying degrees. Immunohistochemical analysis shows similar staining results as with regular <b>mesotheliomas.</b> CGH reveals {{a high number of}} chromosomal imbalances (16. 5 per case; range, 11 – 27). In 10 classical biphasic <b>mesotheliomas</b> that served as a control, defects of comparable number and severity could not be detected (8 per case; range, 2 – 16). The most frequent defects of mesodermomas (losses on 1 p, 4 pq, 9 p, 13 q, 14 q, and gains on 1 q and 15 q), however, could also be found in <b>mesotheliomas</b> of the classical type. Thus, our results support the classification of the so-called mesodermomas as a separate tumor subgroup while maintaining the relationship to the classical <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Therefore, we propose to use the term mesodermoma for this subgroup...|$|R

40|$|Forty-three {{malignant}} pleural <b>mesotheliomas</b> and 10 known metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas to the pleura {{were studied}} by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies 44 - 3 A 6 and 624 A 12. Monoclonal antibodies 44 - 3 A 6 and 624 A 12 were raised against human pulmonary carcinoma cell lines; they recognize a membrane-associated protein of 40, 000 mol wt and a specific sugar sequence of lacto-N-fucopentose III, respectively. Samples were also studied with a broad-spectrum antikeratin antibody and a polyclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These investigations {{were performed on}} formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. The <b>mesotheliomas</b> comprised only grossly evident, pleurectomized, or pneumonectomized cases; they included 22 epithelial, 15 biphasic, and 6 spindle cell types. Electron-microscopic study was also done on 9 cases. None of the <b>mesotheliomas</b> was immunoreactive to 624 A 12, while 9 / 10 metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas were convincingly immunoreactive. Monoclonal antibody 44 - 3 A 6 immunostained all of the metastatic adenocarcinomas strongly, whereas only 10 / 43 <b>mesotheliomas</b> were focally and weakly immunoreactive. The latter included 5 epithelial and 4 biophasic <b>mesotheliomas</b> and 1 spindle cell mesotheliomas; the immunoreaction was confined to scattered single cells, and the staining pattern was readily discernible from that of adenocarcinomas. Forty of 43 <b>mesotheliomas</b> were strongly immunoreactive with the broad-spectrum anti-keratin antibody, whereas 8 / 10 metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed focal and rather weak staining. Seven of 10 metastatic adenocarcinomas were immunoreactive to anti-CEA antibody, while only 15 / 43 <b>mesotheliomas</b> displayed weak immunoreactivity. It is concluded that monoclonal antibodies 44 - 3 A 6 and 624 A 12 are excellent phenotypic markers of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas to the pleura and thus are useful for the differential diagnosis of pleural <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Given conventionally fixed and processed tissues, {{it appears that the}} combined use of these monoclonal antibodies may be more effective for that differential diagnosis than anti-CEA and anti-keratin antibodies...|$|R

40|$|Background: Biological {{effects of}} {{tailor-made}} multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) without functionalization were investigated in vivo in a two-year carcinogenicity study. In the past, intraperitoneal carcinogenicity studies in rats using biopersistent granular dusts {{had always been}} negative, whereas a number of such studies with different asbestos fibers had shown tumor induction. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify possible carcinogenic effects of MWCNTs. We compared induced tumors with asbestos-induced <b>mesotheliomas</b> and evaluated their relevance for humans by immunohistochemical methods. Methods: A total of 500 male Wistar rats (50 per group) were treated once by intraperitoneal injection with 109 or 5 × 109 WHO carbon nanotubes of one of four different MWCNTs suspended in artificial lung medium, which was also used as negative control. Amosite asbestos (108 WHO fibers) served as positive control. Morbid rats were sacrificed and necropsy comprising all organs was performed. Histopathological classification of tumors and, additionally, immunohistochemistry were conducted for podoplanin, pan-cytokeratin, and vimentin to compare induced tumors with malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> occurring in humans. Results: Treatments induced tumors in all dose groups, but incidences and times to tumor differed between groups. Most tumors were histologically and immunohistochemically classified as malignant <b>mesotheliomas,</b> revealing a predominantly superficial spread on the serosal surface of the abdominal cavity. Furthermore, most tumors showed invasion of peritoneal organs, especially the diaphragm. All tested MWCNT types caused <b>mesotheliomas.</b> We observed highest frequencies and earliest appearances after treatment with the rather straight MWCNT types A and B. In the MWCNT C groups, first appearances of morbid mesothelioma-bearing rats were only slightly later. Later during the two-year study, we found <b>mesotheliomas</b> also in rats treated with MWCNT D – the most curved type of nanotubes. Malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> induced by intraperitoneal injection of different MWCNTs and of asbestos were histopathologically and immunohistochemically similar, also compared with <b>mesotheliomas</b> in man, suggesting similar pathogenesis. Conclusion: We showed a carcinogenic effect for all tested MWCNTs. Besides aspect ratio, curvature seems to be an important parameter influencing the carcinogenicity of MWCNTs...|$|R

In this study, blood group antigens, namely Lewisx and Lewisy, known to be expressed in a number of adenocarcinomas of diverse origin were used in the differential diagnosis of 30 samples from 18 <b>mesotheliomas</b> and 18 primary lung adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas showed strong diffuse homogeneous staining, membranous staining, or both for Lewisy in 100 % of cases irrespective of differentiation. Lewisx was expressed in 78 % of adenocarcinomas with a wide variation in distribution of staining. <b>Mesotheliomas</b> did not show the diffuse homogeneous staining pattern but showed a markedly distinctive granular staining in the cytoplasm of rare cells in 23 % of Lewisy and 20 % of Lewisx cases, which was interpreted as negative.
