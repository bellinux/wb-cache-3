5|$|The <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E

Before the <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> was delivered to the first rider on April 3, 1860, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on {{the significance of the}} event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a [...] "precursor" [...] to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15p.m., Russell turned the <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat Denver, under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory. On April 9 at 6:45p.m., the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> reached Carson City, Nevada at 2:30p.m. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, through Placerville, California and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> was delivered via the Pony Express to San Francisco. Bringing with it was a letter of congratulations from President Buchanan to California Governor Downey along with other official government communications, newspapers from New York, Chicago, and St. Louis, along with other important mail to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco. In all, 85 pieces of mail were delivered on this first trip.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} most RPO cars was a hook {{that could be}} used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. [...] The first US patent for such a device (...) was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. With the train often operating at 70mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. [...] In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> while the clerk stood in the open doorway. [...] As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound <b>mail</b> <b>pouch</b> out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train.

50|$|Saddle bag <b>mail</b> <b>pouches</b> {{were never}} in {{use on the}} Pony Express system because of their unwieldiness. The normal large saddle bags were not adept to {{attaching}} to a saddle efficiently and would cause much delay when going from an exhausted horse to a fresh horse when the Pony Express rider switched horses at a station. In 1860 the Pony Express developed a fast mail delivery system using a special saddle mail bag cover called a mochila that made the Pony Express unique. The cover, which had 4 hard leather boxes to carry the mail, was quick and efficient when transferring from one horse to another. All the rider {{had to do was}} change this leather cover with the mail boxes over to a ready horse waiting for him at the station, which was usually done in under 2 minutes. If a horse was injured on the way from one station to another and not capable of further traveling, then all a rider had to do was to take the cover with its mail off the injured horse and walk to the next station to get a new horse. He then threw the cover onto the new saddled horse. The leather blanket cover was designed by Jay G. Kelley, another Pony Express rider. The saddles for the horses that traveled over the Overland Pony Express route were special and standardized, built by a saddlery firm owned and franchised by Israel Landis and sons.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 16 March 1933 Turner was at the {{controls}} {{of one of the}} Fairchild 100-A Pilgrim (NC-731 N) aircraft built for American Airways Inc beginning in 1931. The scheduled flight was a trip from Fort Worth Municipal airport to Amarillo via Dallas and on board was the typical load of Airmail as well as two passengers. Merle Brock, another pilot for American Airways, was on board as a passenger being shuttled to Dallas. R Staulter, the Station Manager for American Airways, was also {{on his way back to}} Dallas. The flight begin as any other however fire suddenly seemed to engulf the plane from nose to tail when they had only reached an altitude of about 150 feet. Turner immediately banked steeply to return to the field for an emergency landing. The two passengers opened the side compartment door and jumped from the plane before it had come to a stop. Turner opened the top hatch to leave the cockpit but the flames prevented him making his escape. He then opened the cockpit side door and jumped, spraining his ankle due to the height of the jump. Due to the fire around him Turner was unable to use the specially placed footholds for climbing in and out of the cockpit. He ran to get his passengers out, finding they had made their escape he entered the passenger compartment and grabbed the sacks of mail. Shortly after Turner left the plane the gasoline tank in one of the wings exploded. The three men escaped with their lives and were transported to the hospital. Turner left the hospital immediately after burns on his hands were treated. Brock had abrasions on his hands and burns on his neck. Staulter was treated for burns on the face and hands and dislocated shoulder. Brock and Staulter remained in the hospital. [...] The fire damaged the plane badly and partially burned three of the <b>mail</b> <b>pouches,</b> one of which was from Amarillo.|$|R

Logan cut the mail and express cars {{from the rest of}} the train. The engineer and fireman were ordered off the locomotive and Kennedy took the two cars down the track several miles. After stopping the locomotive, the two bandits entered the mail car. The three clerks were lined up against a wall.

5000|$|The Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War was {{a dispute}} between the {{citizens}} of two Oklahoma counties and the Rock Island Railroad. In the late 1880s, the Rock Island Railroad built a line into the Indian Territory, entering near Caldwell, Kansas and following the Chisholm Trail. At part of the infrastructure, the company established railroad stations near several of the existing stagecoach stations along the trail. Two of the stations, Pond Creek, built at Pond Stage Stand on Round Pond Creek, and Enid, built at Skeleton Station near the Skeleton Ranch headquarters, would become involved in a controversy between the railroad and the United States Department of the Interior. The problems began when the Department of the Interior set about opening the Cherokee Outlet to settlement. Hoping to lessen the problem of county seat wars, a common event in newly settled areas of the Old West, the Department of the Interior divided the Cherokee Outlet into counties and assigned them county seats. Pond Creek {{was chosen as the}} seat of [...] "L" [...] County and Enid became the seat of [...] "O" [...] County. Following the announcement of the official county seats, several Cherokee citizens began claiming land allotments, choosing sites near Pond Creek and Enid. Subsequently, railroad officials were accused of conspiring with the Cherokee to speculate on town development. Accordingly, officials in the Department of the Interior moved the government approved towns to different locations nearby, effectively creating two new towns. A land run opened the Cherokee Outlet in 1893 and settlers, mostly from Kansas, occupied all four town sites; railroad Pond Creek, government Pond Creek, railroad Enid, or North Enid, and government Enid, or South Enid. The Rock Island Railroad responded to the government's action by refusing to stop trains at the government towns. Initially, the citizens in both government towns protested to get the railroad to provide them service and the Oklahoma Territorial government and United States House of Representatives supported them. However, the United States Senate took the railroad's side and refused to act. Government officials then informed the Rock Island Railroad that they had to furnish mail service to the two government towns. The Rock Island company responded by installing a type of hook on their trains to pick up and deliver mail without having to slow down. So when the <b>mail</b> <b>pouches</b> broke open, furious citizens claimed it was done intentionally. Not long after that, the people of Enid passed an ordinance setting a speed limit for trains passing through the town, but the Rock Island Railroad ignored it. Citizens in both government towns began attempting to flag down trains, placing dummies on the tracks, and leaving wagons and debris across the rails. But when that failed, the citizens resorted to violence. In June 1894, the people of Pond Creek tore up about a hundred yards of railroad and wrecked a freight train. By July, citizens were shooting at passing trains and placing bombs on the railroad tracks. Later that month, a group of unknown assailants sawed partially through a number of wooden supports on the trestle near Enid, which led to the wrecking of another freight train. To restore order, men of the United States Marshals Service and United States Army troops from Fort Reno and Fort Supply were sent in to patrol the railroad right-of-way. Violence continued though. Finally, the United States Senate decided to intervene and on August 8, 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed an act which required railroads [...] "to establish and maintain passenger stations and freight depots at or within one-fourth of a mile of the boundary limits of all town sites established prior to August 8, 1894, in said Territories." [...] Soon after, railroad Pond Creek was renamed Jefferson and relocated to higher ground; government Pond Creek remained, but [...] "L" [...] County was eventually renamed Grant County and the seat was moved to Medford. Railroad Enid became North Enid and government Enid, or South Enid, became the present-day Enid, the seat of Garfield Count.|$|R

40|$|A satire on the {{competition}} between rival editors Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett for New York post office printing contracts. The artist also comments on the circulation wars between Bennett's "New York Herald" and Greeley's relatively new paper the "Tribune, "and on latter's editorial support of abolition. Clay shows Greeley (at left) outdistanced by James Gordon Bennett, who rides a black steed with a <b>pouch</b> marked "Black <b>Mail.</b> " The <b>pouch</b> may be a reference to some aspect of Bennett's scandal-mongering journalism or to accusations of extortion made against Bennett by British lecturer Silk Buckingham in 1843. Greeley wears his characteristic frock coat, stove-pipe hat, knee-breeches, and boots. The Scottish-born Bennett wears a tam o'shanter, tartan sash, and kilt. The artist exaggerates his cross-eyed squint. Greeley laments, "I'm afraid my two hundred dollars is lost, {{as well as the}} Post Office printing!" In December 1842, Greeley was sued for libel by novelist James Fenimore Cooper. In the trial, reported in detail in the "Tribune," the plaintiff was awarded a judgment of $ 200 against Greeley. Bennett exclaims, "I shall distance the Squash [i. e., Greeley] if he don't pull foot!" Both men race toward the New York Post Office, in front of which stands a man in a hat and long coat [...] probably the postmaster. The man says, "The largest circulation gets it!" At the left stand two black men, one with a paper marked "Emancipation" in his pocket, the other holding a copy of the "Tribune. " The first says, "Brother Greely rideth like one possessed! He reminds me of Death on a pale Horse!" The second, "My presumption is dat de debil himself helps dat dam Bennett!" The essentially racist portrayal of the two blacks is reminiscent of Clay's much earlier "Life in Philadelphia" series. (See Munsing, pp. 28 - 29.) Davison dates the print about 1841. The first issue of Greeley's newspaper appeared in April of that year. The editor's reference to his $ 200 loss, however, suggests that Clay's drawing did not appear until after the Cooper lawsuit of December 1842. Signed with monogram: C (Edward Williams Clay).
