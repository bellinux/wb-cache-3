5|$|Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) lies unconscious, {{having been}} thrown from her car after it plunged over a ravine. Steph Sims (Tonicha Lawrence) watches {{down from the}} top of the cliff before driving off. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> calls for an ambulance, but is hit by a car before she can. As Connie regains consciousness, she notices Grace Beauchamp's (Emily Carey) shoe in the car. Flames begin erupting from the vehicle. Connie moves towards the car but before she can get to Grace it explodes.|$|E
5|$|During the quarter-finals, Canada {{faced the}} United States with McLeod {{starting}} in goal. In the twelfth {{minute of the}} game, American player Heather O'Reilly made a shot on goal, but it was stopped by McLeod. Angela Hucles then got the rebound and scored for the United States. However, McLeod injured her right knee during the play. She was down for several minutes before {{she got up and}} attempted to resume playing. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> was replaced by goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc in the 19th minute. The United States won the game 1–2. It was later revealed that McLeod had torn her right ACL.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> {{came down}} with a flush {{on her face and}} tears in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the freight steamer was ready to leave, and a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> {{proceeded}} on her way.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> heard a splash. The wounded man had leapt {{into the}} water, and was making for the shore.|$|R
25|$|A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> died.|$|E
25|$|Later {{she went}} to the Casa Rosada, where the {{received}} the presidential attributes in the White Hall {{at the hands of the}} Temporary President of the Senate, Federico Pinedo, President of the Chamber of Deputies Emilio Monzó and President of the Supreme Court Ricardo Lorenzetti. <b>Minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> and the President went to the historic balcony where thousands of people waited in the Plaza de Mayo.|$|E
25|$|After reloading, the {{submarine}} tracked the remaining {{units of the}} convoy. Shortly after 10:00, she fired on and damaged one of the escorts. Forty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> fired on the remaining merchantman and observed it suddenly disappear from the radar screen. After 11:00, {{she made her way}} through the wreckage to pick up survivors. Only four allowed themselves to be picked up; and, of these, one died of his wounds.|$|E
60|$|One <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> rushed down again, breathless. Amelia is {{far from}} slim, and I never before knew her exert herself so actively.|$|R
6000|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> {{joined him}} on the farther bank of the moat. [...] "Run!" [...] she said. [...] "Run for your life; there's death behind!" ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Mr. St. Clare and {{his little}} girl heard a great noise coming from Miss Ophelia's room. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> appeared, {{dragging}} Topsy behind her.|$|R
25|$|Seine {{underwent}} a refit at Chatham Dockyard between June and July 1803, with Milne recommissioning her in May for the North Sea. However, {{shortly after her}} return to service she grounded on a sandbank to the northward of Terschelling on 21 July 1803. That evening Milne had ordered the pilots to keep her out of shallow water and they had assured {{him that she was}} safe; forty <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> struck. The crew labored all night and well into the morning, with the assistance of two passing merchant vessels to pull her off and to lighten her, but to no avail. At about 11:30am the crew abandoned Seine; they set fire to her as they left to prevent the French recapturing her.|$|E
500|$|Glasgow fought {{almost an}} entirely {{separate}} battle as the German armoured cruisers ignored her almost completely and she inconclusively dueled the light cruisers [...] and [...] Glasgow broke {{contact with the}} German squadron at 20:05 and discovered Monmouth, listing and down by the bow, having extinguished her fires, 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>She</b> was trying to turn north to put her stern to the heavy northerly swell and was taking water at the bow. There was little that Glasgow could do to assist the larger ship as the moonlight illuminated both ships and the Germans were searching for them.|$|E
500|$|The {{summer of}} 1917 {{provided}} few opportunities for Wainwright to test her sub-killing techniques. On 4July, {{a member of}} the destroyer's crew spotted a purported periscope and soon thereafter others claimed that a torpedo was reported to have passed the ship, [...] astern. Wainwright depth-charged the last indicated position of the undersea raider but to no avail. On the morning of 20August, after [...] brought up some oil with one of her depth charges, Wainwright dropped a couple of depth charges as she passed through the faint slick. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> joined other ships in some sporadic gunfire but failed to prove that a submarine was in the area.|$|E
60|$|He put {{the hand}} {{she gave him}} to his lips. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> and her nurse left the house, and Stephen {{remained}} wondering over the events that had happened.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> {{felt herself}} gently {{drawn to the}} nearest stone seat, and she sank down upon it, still {{trying very hard to}} remain calm and above all not to cry.|$|R
6000|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> had {{returned}} {{with him to}} the waiting-room, where, in the thick swim of things, she saw something like the disk of a clock. [...] "Is there an up-train?" [...] she asked.|$|R
500|$|Cöln steamed to aid {{her sister}} Mainz, which was under heavy fire from several British cruisers and battlecruisers. At around 13:25, she {{came upon the}} damaged cruiser [...] and several destroyers. Cöln engaged the British ships briefly, but was {{interrupted}} {{by the appearance of}} the British battlecruisers. At 13:37, Cöln made a 16-point turn and returned fire at the battlecruisers; the British ships turned to port to steam closer to Cöln, which in turn similarly altered course to escape. She was hit several times, however, including one hit that killed Maass. At 13:56, another German cruiser arrived on the scene, which distracted the British ships and allowed Cöln to slip away to the north. About fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> turned back south-east to return to port.|$|E
500|$|On 5 September, Virginia and New Jersey were {{anchored}} off the Diamond Shoals lightship, off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina for the tests, {{which were}} conducted by the Martin NBS-1 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group. Observers were aboard the Army transport ship [...] The bombing runs began just before 9:00, and on the third attack seven NSB-1s dropped a pair of [...] bombs each, scoring two hits that caused extensive damage. The blast destroyed the bridge and knocked down both masts and all three funnels. The rest of the bombs landed close to the ship, causing major underwater damage. Within twenty minutes, Virginia capsized, and ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> slipped beneath the waves, joining New Jersey, which had been sunk earlier that day.|$|E
500|$|On August 17, 2008, she won {{the silver}} medal in the 50-meter freestyle, {{finishing}} in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. [...] Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials. [...] Thirty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4×100-meter medley relay. [...] Her split on the 4×100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. [...] The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time more than a full second faster.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> {{stood by}} Cuthbert's side. He {{was lying on}} his back with his eyes open. A {{hospital}} rug had been thrown over him. As she bent over him his eyes fell on her face and he smiled faintly.|$|R
60|$|But {{the darkest}} hour, so the proverb goes, is {{just before the}} dawn, and after Lilian had had her cry out and was sitting at her window in the dusk, {{watching}} a thin new moon shining over the trees down the street, her inspiration came to her. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> whirled into the tiny sitting-room where her mother was sewing.|$|R
60|$|Three <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> when <b>she</b> {{had left}} the window, knocks, not of {{multitude}} but of strength, sounded through the house, and the waiting-maid tripped up.|$|R
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have these really overwrought love songs, so {{we really wanted to}} have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> sent me a list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off". [...] At first, the song {{was meant to be a}} power ballad.|$|E
500|$|At 16:30, {{the light}} cruiser , {{scouting}} {{in front of}} Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north, towards the Grand Fleet in {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Run to the North". His order only applied to his own forces; the 5th Battle Squadron continued south until after it passed Beatty heading northwestwards at 16:51. Beatty then ordered Evan-Thomas to turn his ships in succession to follow the battlecruisers three minutes later. This meant that they were some [...] closer to the rapidly advancing High Sea Fleet. And now within range of the battleships of the 3rd Squadron which opened fire on the 5th Battle Squadron as they made their turn.|$|E
500|$|By 2:20, an {{estimated}} 8,000tons of water {{was in the}} ship, {{and she was in}} serious danger of capsizing, so KzS Harder gave the order to abandon ship. The torpedo boats G37, G38, G40, and V45 came alongside the stricken battlecruiser to evacuate the ship's crew, though six men were trapped in the bow and could not be freed. By 02:45 Lützow was submerged up to her bridge. G38 fired two torpedoes into the ship, and two <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> disappeared below the waves. The ship was approximately [...] north-west of Horns Reef when she was scuttled. The position of the wreck is estimated to be [...] During the battle, Lützow had fired {{an estimated}} 380 main battery shells and 400 rounds from her secondary guns, as well as two torpedoes. In return, she was hit 24 times by British heavy-caliber shells. The ship's crew suffered 115 men killed and another 50 wounded, second only to Derfflinger, which lost 157 men killed and 26 wounded.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour and}} forty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> and <b>she</b> was in Stephen's arms at the Plymouth station. Not upon the platform--in the secret retreat of a deserted waiting-room.|$|R
60|$|He drew nearer still. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> and <b>she</b> saw his scarlet form {{disappear}} {{amid the}} ferny thicket, {{almost in a}} flash, like a brand swiftly waved.|$|R
60|$|A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> Grace appeared. <b>She</b> {{looked at}} Sam in surprise.|$|R
500|$|This {{manoeuvre}} was successful, and the British {{lost sight}} of the Germans until 8:05pm, when the light cruiser [...] spotted smoke bearing west-northwest. Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and had engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only [...] away. Inflexible opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers. Shortly after 8:30 the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds at them because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 2:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.|$|E
500|$|When the British first {{attacked}} the German torpedo boats, Hipper immediately dispatched Stettin and Frauenlob, {{and several other}} cruisers that were in distant support, {{to come to their}} aid. At 08:32, Stettin received the report of German torpedo boats in contact with the British, and immediately weighed anchor and steamed off to support them. Twenty-six <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> encountered the British destroyers and opened fire, at a range of [...] The attack forced the British ships to break off and turn back west. During the engagement, lookouts aboard Stettin spotted a British cruiser in the distance, but it did not join the battle. By 9:10, the British had withdrawn out of range, and Stettin fell back to get steam in all of her boilers. During this portion of the battle, the ship was hit once, on the starboard No. 4 gun, which killed two men and badly injured another. Her intervention prevented the British from sinking the torpedo boats [...] and [...]|$|E
500|$|The [...] came {{alongside}} at 04:30 {{to transfer}} a [...] salvage pump as the corvette was still taking on water. At 05:01, Butcher ordered all remaining hands aboard the Soviet ship because Denbigh Castle was slowly sinking by the bow, only the officers remaining aboard. Buresvestniks captain, not wanting the corvette to founder in the channel, {{took over the}} tow at 06:15, by which time her stern was nearly out of the water. Denbigh Castle was beached at 07:30 at Bolshaya Volokovaya Bay near Vaenga; Buresvestnik then pushed her stern around. The ship began to slowly list with the ebbing tide and the officers abandoned her at 09:05; five <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> capsized and slid into deeper water. The intense cold made later efforts to retrieve or destroy secret documents and equipment still aboard extremely difficult, but the diving team from the light cruiser [...] did manage to demolish the radar office. In recognition of her service, Denbigh Castle was awarded the battle honour Arctic 1945.|$|E
5000|$|In the meantime, we {{felt the}} lack of a rabbinical leader in Aix-les-Bains. And so when we heard of a Rabbi Rubinstein in nearby Lyon, I went with Dr. Hillel Seidman to visit him. When we entered Rabbi Rubinstein's home, his wife greeted us. When I told her my name and that I came from Warsaw, she said to me, [...] "Wait a moment, please", and stepped out. A <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> <b>she</b> {{returned}} and showed me to Rabbi Rubinstein's room.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the veranda}} vibrated with her moving weight, {{and he knew}} that Joan had gone into the house. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> was back beside him. He had never seen her smoke, and it struck him as {{peculiar}} that she should be smoking now. Then he guessed the reason. With a quick glance, he noted the hand at her side, and in it the familiar, paper-wrapped dynamite. He noted, also, the end of fuse, split properly, into which had been inserted the head of a wax match.|$|R
60|$|It was a long, hard row for {{the little}} twelve-year-old arms. Fortunately there was no wind. But thicker and thicker came the snow; finally the kitchen light was hidden in it. For a moment Mary Margaret's heart sank in despair; the next it gave a joyful bound, for, turning, she saw the dark tower of the {{lighthouse}} directly behind her. By the aid of her lantern she rowed to the landing, sprang out and made her boat fast. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>she</b> was in the lighthouse kitchen.|$|R
