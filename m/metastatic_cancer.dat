5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancer,</b> and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera.

Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancer,</b> hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prognostic impact of time between primary breast cancer and diagnosis of distant metastasis (metastatic-free interval, MFI) on the survival of <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> in 2007 - 2009 in eight hospitals in the Southeast of the Netherlands were included and categorised based on MFI. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used {{to determine the}} prognostic impact of de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> vs recurrent <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> (MFI 24 months and > 24 months), adjusted for age, hormone receptor and HER 2 status, initial site of metastasis and use of prior (neo) adjuvant systemic therapy. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifteen patients were included and divided in three subgroups based on MFI; 154 patients with de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer,</b> 176 patients with MFI 24 months. Patients with de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> had a prolonged survival compared with patients with recurrent <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> with MFI 24 months (median, 29. 4 vs 27. 9 months, P= 0. 73). Adjusting for other prognostic factors, patients with MFI 24 months with de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> no significant difference in mortality risk was found. The association between MFI and survival was seen irrespective of use of (neo) adjuvant systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> had a significantly better outcome when compared with patients with MFI 24 months, patients with de novo <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> had similar outcome...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that primary {{prostate}} cancers are multifocal and are composed of multiple genetically distinct cancer cell clones. Whether or not multiclonal primary prostate cancers typically give rise to multiclonal or monoclonal prostate cancer metastases is largely unknown, although studies at single chromosomal loci are consistent with the latter case. Here we show through a high-resolution genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number survey that most, if not all, <b>metastatic</b> prostate <b>cancers</b> have monoclonal origins and maintain a unique signature copy number pattern of the parent cancer cell while also accumulating a variable number of separate subclonally sustained changes. We find no relationship between anatomic site of metastasis and genomic copy number change pattern. Taken together with past animal and cytogenetic studies of metastasis and recent single-locus genetic data in prostate and other <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers,</b> these data indicate that despite common genomic heterogeneity in primary <b>cancers,</b> most <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers</b> arise from a single precursor cancer cell. This study establishes that genomic archeology of multiple anatomically separate <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers</b> in individuals can be used to define the salient genomic features of a parent cancer clone of proven lethal metastatic phenotype...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the changes of histology and expression of MMP- 2 and nm 23 -H 1 in primary and <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer.</b> METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven gastric cancer patients with lymph node and/or distal metastasis between 1997 and 2001 were reviewed. Differences in histology {{of the primary}} and <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> were assessed. MMP- 2 and nm 23 -H 1 immunoreactivity was compared in 44 patients with tumor infiltration to the serosa layer. RESULTS: Poorly and moderately differentiated <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> was found in 88. 7 % (157 / 177) and primary gastric cancer in 75. 7 % (134 / 177) of the patients. The histological type of <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> that was not completely {{in accordance with the}} preponderant histology of primary gastric cancer was observed in 25 patients (14. 1 %). MMP- 2 immunoreactivity in <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> was significantly stronger than that in primary gastric cancer, while nm 23 -H 1 immunoreactivity showed no difference in primary and <b>metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Metastatic</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> presents more aggressive histological morphology and higher MMP- 2 immunoreactivity than primary gastric cancer. This heterogeneity may elicit a possible mechanism of gastric cancer metastasis...|$|R

However the clinical impact of BSI in <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> patients is not yet known. One reason for the differences between castration-resistant <b>metastatic</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> and <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> may be that the mortality of <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> patients depends on control of metastasis to distant organs by chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.|$|R

25|$|Where available, imaging {{studies may}} be {{employed}} {{as part of}} the staging process in select cases to look for signs of <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancer.</b> However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the patient to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{relevance of}} different molecular markers in lung {{cancer is a}} crucial issue still worth investigating, and the specimens collected and analyzed represent a valuable source of material. Cyclin-D 1, c-erbB- 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have shown to be promising as prognosticators in human cancer. In this study, we sought to examine the importance of Cyclin-D 1, c-erbB- 2 and VEGF, and to study the quantitative relationship among these factors and disease progression in metastases vs corresponding primary <b>cancer,</b> and <b>metastatic</b> vs non <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Material and Methods: We used immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis to evaluate the amount of tumour staining for Cyclin-D 1, c-erbB- 2 and VEGF in 52 patients with surgically excised ademocarcinoma of the lung, and the outcome for our study was survival time until death from hematogenic metastases. Results: Metastasis presented lower c-erbB- 2 expression than corresponding primary cancers (p= 0. 02). Cyclin-D 1 and VEGF expression were also lower in metastases than in corresponding primary cancers, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Non-metastatic cancers also presented significantly lower Cyclin-D 1 and c-erbB- 2 expression than <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers</b> (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 01, respectively). Equally significant was the difference between higher c-erbB- 2 expression by <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers</b> compared to non-metastatic cancers (p= 0. 02). Considering survival in Kaplan-Maier analysis, Cyclin-D 1 (p= 0. 04), c-erbB- 2 (p= 0. 04) and VEGF (p< 0. 01) were important predictors of survival in <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

Improved median survival time and response indicates that docetaxel slows <b>metastatic</b> <b>cancer</b> progression and can lead to disease-free survival.
