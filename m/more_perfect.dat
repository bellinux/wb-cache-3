5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing <b>more</b> <b>perfect,</b> is its independence from any other thing. Nothing <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

50|$|Libon was a 5th-century BC {{architect}} of Ancient Greece. Born in Elis, he built the Doric temple to Zeus at Olympia in about 460 BC. Libon, through {{his work on}} the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, is said to have inspired the technique and design of the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis - though this was obviously later and <b>more</b> <b>perfected.</b>|$|R

5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana's {{total of}} seven tournament championships by {{the start of}} 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono, who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, {{finishing}} runner-up in the other six. He produced two <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> scores of 15–0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to ōzeki Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takatōriki. The merger of his father's Fujishima stable with his uncle's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to face them all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness.|$|E

50|$|Dickite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Almwch, Island of Anglesey, Wales, UK. Dickite is scattered across Wales forming occurrences in vein assemblages {{and as a}} rock-forming mineral. This area and others where dickite can be found all share similar characteristics. Pockets in phylloid algal limestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstone are a suitable environment for dickite. Very low pressure and high temperatures are the ideal environment {{for the formation of}} dickite. The <b>more</b> <b>perfected</b> crystallization of dickite occurs in porous algal limestones {{in the form of a}} white powder. The more disordered dickites can be found in less porous rocks.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a player}} does 2 or <b>more</b> <b>PERFECTs</b> consecutively, {{he will get}} bonus points for doing so. These PERFECT combos (or [...] "Perfect chains") enable players to {{interfere}} with the opposition. A blue circle indicates that you made a PERFECT in your move and acts as a shield. When a player performs a PERFECT X1 (or perfect X2 in some cases) they will make either the player ahead or behind them receive a yellow circle. While under the yellow circle, a person will not receive points if he does not achieve a PERFECT (in a finish move it reduces a percentage rather than the whole move).|$|R

Obama responded with a speech, A <b>More</b> <b>Perfect</b> Union, which addressed the criticisms and largely alleviated them from popular political criticisms at the time.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the series, as the Tleilaxu try to create <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> mimics, the Face Dancers gain the ability to absorb the {{consciousness}} of their subjects by touch alone, with the potential unintended side effect of gradually becoming that person, and passing beyond the control of the Tleilaxu Masters.

25|$|Following the war, the {{political}} energies {{of the newly}} independent states were focused on forming “a <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> union,” first in the Articles of Confederation, later in the Constitution of the United States of America. The newly independent daughter churches of the Church of England also sought “a <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> union,” and foremost in the leadership was the same Abraham Beach. In the winter of 1783/84 he corresponded with William White (later the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church) and other clergy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York soliciting a gathering to “consider {{the state of the}} church.” He extended an invitation to meet at Christ Church May 11, 1784. The outgrowth of that meeting was a call for another meeting in October 1784 with representatives from all thirteen states to consider a general convention to manage the affairs of the newly independent church. The First General Convention met in September 1785, leading to the current shape of the church we now know: with equal voice and vote for bishops, clergy and laity, the beginnings of an American Book of Common Prayer, and our own national Constitution and Canons.|$|E

50|$|From the 9th century certain villages grew in {{size and}} their {{internal}} design became more complex, giving rise to the era of late pre-Columbian chiefdoms which lasted until the 16th century. It is possible that more fruitful varieties of corn and other crops, as well as <b>more</b> <b>perfected</b> agricultural methods coincided {{with an increase in}} population, a deeper social hierarchy and stronger relationships between communities further down the social chain. In some villages the caciques or shamans promoted the infrastructure improvements that required the mobilization of immense work forces. There was a notable peak in the art of goldsmithing throughout the country. In addition there was an increase in the variety of domestic and personal goods, regional trade, alliances and territorial conflicts.|$|R

25|$|Despite this {{formidable}} {{array of}} tradition and scholarly opinion, the Oxford Franciscans William of Ware and especially Blessed John Duns Scotus defended the doctrine. Scotus proposed {{a solution to the}} theological problem involved of being able to reconcile the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ. Rather it {{was the result of a}} <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> redemption given to her on account of her special role in history.|$|E
25|$|When {{rolled into}} a ball, G. marginata can be {{distinguished}} from a rolled–up pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a woodlouse have {{a greater number of}} small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, {{that from}} a {{rational}} point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, {{as to say that}} she first contracted it and then was delivered. Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it {{was the result of a}} <b>more</b> <b>perfect</b> redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.|$|E
