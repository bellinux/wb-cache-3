At the 2004 games, she won a bronze medal in the T53 100m, behind Tanni Grey-Thompson and Francesca Porcellato. Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a {{personal}} best, but she also had eyes on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay.

Welch became {{a star in the}} mid-1960s and was exotic, brunette, and smolderingly sexual. Her countless publicity photos helped to popularize her image, dress style, and 1960s and 1970s fashion trends. Welch and other actresses also <b>made</b> <b>big</b> hair popular.|$|E

Ryan Watson top-scored for the Scots with 94, but Dougie Brown (59 off 44 balls) and Fraser Watts (55) also <b>made</b> <b>big</b> contributions, as the Irish bowling conceded their highest total in this tournament – 324 for 8. Paul Hoffmann ripped out two Irish wickets quickly, but Ed Joyce and wicketkeeper Jeremy Bray rebuilt to 148 for 2. However, a flurry of wickets – Craig Wright taking three for 48 as the most – sent the Irish staring down the barrel, first at 188 for 6, and then at 222 for 9.

25|$|Dhoni {{studied at}} DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand where he {{initially}} excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team {{and was sent}} to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well. Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard. Dhoni was a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal. His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. But {{he also had a}} mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story <b>made</b> <b>big</b> news on the next day.|$|E

500|$|A {{short time}} before {{his return to}} Buenos Aires on 3 June 1794, Belgrano was elected by Don Diego de Gardoqui as [...] "perpetual secretary" [...] of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, a new local {{institution}} which dealt with commercial and industrial issues {{in the name of}} the crown. This date would be later known in Argentina as Economist Day. He would remain in this office until 1810, and would deal with commercial disputes and promote agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not having enough freedom to make big changes in the economic system, he <b>made</b> <b>big</b> efforts to improve education.

500|$|Much of {{the album}} was {{formulated}} during [...] "vibe sessions" [...] in which the group and producers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select performers they saw, and invite them to the studio. [...] They would then [...] "sit around, smoke a few, drink a few", and create ideas for new songs. However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which <b>made</b> <b>Big</b> Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound. [...] To maintain musical cohesion with Big Boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette, André decided to combine rapping with soul-inspired crooning, which had {{a major influence on}} Stankonias sound. [...] "Snappin & Trappin'" [...] features a guest appearance from then-unknown rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noted that while working with OutKast, he used the opportunity to try to [...] "compete" [...] with the duo to improve his rapping skills. Big Boi was impressed with Killer Mike's abilities, noting, [...] "When I first heard him spit, his voice was just so commanding. [...] He's a very intelligent guy." ...|$|E
500|$|It was at Milan, in {{particular}} under manager Carlo Ancelotti, where Pirlo <b>made</b> <b>big</b> strides in developing {{into a world}} class player, {{and one of the}} best deep-lying playmakers and set-piece specialists in the world, as he went on to achieve notable domestic and international success during his time with the club. Pirlo later recalled the period he has spent in Milan with Ancelotti: [...] "He changed my career, putting me in front of the defence. We shared some unforgettable moments. We had a magnificent past together." [...] After Mazzone's pioneering decision to move Pirlo into a deep-seated playmaking role with Brescia during the previous season, Milan managers Fatih Terim and, {{in particular}}, Carlo Ancelotti further developed this role for him at Milan. In Ancelotti's 4–3–1–2 and 4–3–2–1 formations, Pirlo was deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in front of the defence, which allowed him to play alongside other talented attacking midfielders, such as Rivaldo, Rui Costa and eventually Kaká, replacing the gap left by Milan legend Demetrio Albertini in the deep midfield playmaking role. He would become an integral part of the Rossoneri's midfield, forming a formidable partnership with Gennaro Gattuso, as well as with Clarence Seedorf and Massimo Ambrosini, who also supported his playmaking role defensively. Pirlo was given the nickname the metronome during his time at the club, for the way in which he set the team's rhythm.|$|E
