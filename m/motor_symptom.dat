40|$|Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{which starts}} with unilateral motor symptoms.

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{reported}} genetic predictors of <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> progression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In familial PD, disease severity is associated with higher a-synuclein (SNCA) expression levels, and in postmortem studies expression varies with SNCA genetic variants. Furthermore, SNCA is a well-known risk factor for PD occurrence. We recruited Parkinson’s patients from the communities of three central California counties to investigate the influence of SNCA genetic variants on <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> progression in idiopathic PD. We repeatedly assessed this cohort of patients over an average of 5. 1 years for <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> changes employing the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Of 363 population-based incident PD cases diagnosed less than 3 years from baseline assessment, 242 cases were successfully re-contacted and 233 were re-examined at least once. Of subjects lost to follow-up, 69 % were due to death. Adjusting for covariates, risk of faster decline of motor function as measured by annual increase in motor UPDRS exam score was increased 4 -fold in carriers of the REP 1 263 bp promoter variant (OR 4. 03, 95 %CI: 1. 57 – 10. 4). Our data also suggest a contribution to increased risk by the G-allele for rs 356165 (OR 1. 66; 95 %CI: 0. 96 – 2. 88), and we observed a strong trend across categories when both genetic variants were considered (p for trend = 0. 002).

40|$|Abstract Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a progressive, {{disabling}} neurodegenerative disorder with {{onset of}} motor and non-motor features. Both reduce {{quality of life}} of PD patients and cause caregiver burden. This review aims to provide a survey of possible therapeutic options for treatment of motor and non <b>motor</b> <b>symptoms</b> of PD and to discuss their relation to each other. MAO-B-Inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, dopamine agonists and levodopa with its various application modes mainly improve the dopamine associated <b>motor</b> <b>symptoms</b> in PD. This armentarium of PD drugs only partially influences the onset and occurrence of non <b>motor</b> <b>symptoms.</b> These PD features predominantly result from non dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Autonomic features, such as seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, orthostatic syndrome, salivation, bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, sleep disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction with impaired execution and impulse control may appear. Drug therapy of these non <b>motor</b> <b>symptoms</b> complicates long-term PD drug therapy due to possible occurrence of drug interactions, - side effects, and altered pharmacokinetic behaviour of applied compounds.

40|$|Background. Apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson disease (PD) are {{associated}} with clinically significant behavioral disorders. Aim. To explore the phenomenology, distribution, and clinical correlates of these two behaviors. Methods. In PD participants (n= 99) without dementia we explored the distribution of measures of motivation and impulsivity using univariate methods. We then undertook factor analysis to define specific underlying dimensions of apathy and impulsivity. Regression models were developed to determine the associated demographic and clinical features of the derived dimensions. Results. The factor analysis of apathy (AES-C) revealed a two-factor solution: “cognitive-behavior” and “social indifference”. The factor analysis of impulsivity (BIS- 11) revealed a five-factor solution: “inattention”; “impetuosity”; “personal security”; “planning”; and “future orientation”. Apathy was significantly associated with: age, age of <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> onset (positive correlation), disease stage, <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and depression. Impulsivity was significantly associated with: age of <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> onset (negative correlation), gambling and anxiety scores, and motor complications. We observed an overlap of apathy and impulsivity in some participants. Conclusion. In PD, apathy and impulsivity have specific phenomenological profiles and {{are associated}} with particular clinical phenotypes. In spite of this, there is some overlap of behaviors which may suggests common aspects in the pathology underlying motivation and reward processes...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{degenerative}} sub-cortical {{neurological disorder}} primarily involving morphologic and neurochemical {{changes in the}} human brain, particularly the basal ganglia. Basal ganglia is a term used to identify areas of the basal forebrain and midbrain known {{to be involved in}} the control of movement and some higher cortical functions. Cardinal motor symptoms in PD include muscle rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, a loss of postural reflexes and, in extreme cases, akinesia. These symptoms can be experienced either unilaterally or bilaterally. Non-motor symptoms in PD include cognitive decline, depression, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and apathy. Changes in cognitive functioning in PD can range from mild cognitive impairment to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). While studies investigating a potential relationship between <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> phenotype and cognitive decline in PD exist, results have been equivocal to date. Additional research has been recommended and this was the aim of the current studies. Participants (n = 88) were recruited from the Royal Hobart Hospital and administered a comprehensive assessment battery that included demographic and mood measures, a range of cognitive measures covering immediate and delayed memory, executive functioning, visuospatial functioning, and language, as well as several tests of motor functioning. Study One examined the link between current motor functioning and cognitive performance. Despite no significant between groups differences on demographic variables such as age, years of education, pre-morbid cognitive functioning, mood, and disease duration, participants in the lower motor functioning group consistently performed more poorly on all cognitive tasks included in the assessment battery. Study Two examined the impact of side of <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> onset, comparing the current cognitive functioning of participants who experience left sided, right sided, or bilateral motor symptoms at time of initial diagnosis. While no significant differences were found between those with left sided and right sided <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> onset, those with bilateral <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> onset were significantly (p <. 001) more likely to achieve the poorest cognitive results. Study Three examined the potentially confounding impact of motor functioning and side of onset when assessing anxiety and depression in a PD population using the two-factor Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as well as a three-factor model of the HADS that separated anxiety, depression, and psychomotor symptoms. Results cautioned against reliance on the traditional HADS for detecting mood symptoms in people with PD. Overall results indicate that <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> presentation can provide valuable information regarding cognitive functioning and mood in PD populations...|$|E

Sleep-related deficits are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and significantly affect quality of life. The etiology of sleep problems is not well understood as they may arise from disease-related pathology or from factors such as motor dysfunction or medications. They may also affect the integrity of cognitive processes. In other disorders, actigraphy has emerged as an alternative to polysomnography to measure sleep, raising the question of its ability to capture sleep quality in PD. Study # 1 evaluated the validity of actigraphy by examining its association with self-report in 30 patients with PD and 14 normal control participants (NC). For NC, actigraphic sleep variables were not related to any self-reported measures of sleep, a finding consistent with previous reports of over-reporting of sleep problems in older adults. In PD patients these correlations were significant, suggesting that actigraphy is an appropriate method of measuring sleep quality in PD. Study # 2 investigated factors associated with sleep disturbance using actigraphy and questionnaire measures in 35 PD patients. <b>Motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and dopaminergic medication dosages were significantly related to sleep quality. Other factors affecting sleep were disease subtypes, with non-tremor onset patients reporting worse sleep quality than tremor-onset patients, and gender, with men having worse sleep quality and more excessive daytime sleepiness than women. Actigraphy identified individuals with possible REM behavior disorder, a sleep disorder that is implicated in early detection of PD. Study # 3 investigated the association between actigraphic sleep measures and cognition in 36 PD patients and 18 NC participants. Executive dysfunction was predicted by sleep efficiency and not by <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, medication dosage or disease duration. For memory, by contrast, <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and disease duration but not sleep quality predicted performance. For psychomotor function, none of the variables significantly predicted performance. The relation of sleep and cognition in PD varied with gender and <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> subtypes. Taken together, these studies show actigraphy to be a valid method of assessing sleep quality in non-demented PD patients, indicate the relation of sleep to <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, medication, gender, and disease subtypes, and demonstrate that sleep disturbances in PD significantly predict cognitive functioning...|$|E

Significant reductions in apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation were only seen in the NR 1 antisense-treated lesioned rats (after a single intraparenchymal dose of antisense to the lesioned neostriatum; 15 nmol in 3 μl of saline) at 1 or 2 days after the treatment. No motor effect {{was seen in the}} lesioned animals with control treatments (sham, treatment using NR 1 sense oligonucleotides, randomized oligonucleotides or saline, respectively). In contrast, significant increases in expression of NR 1 mRNA in the lesioned neostriatum were seen in rats with control treatments but not in rats with NR 1 antisense treatment. Importantly, in the lesioned neostriatum that was treated with NR 1 antisense, a significant reduction in NR 1 protein expression was found and NR 1 immunoreactivity was seen to reduce in perikarya of presumed striatal medium spiny neurons. The present data indicate that a single dose of NR 1 antisense ameliorates <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> in the rat model.

40|$|Walking is an {{exercise}} that has been thought to benefit Parkinson’s disease (PD). In a laboratory setting treadmills have been employed to successfully improve certain aspects of gait in PD (Cakit et al., 2007, Fisher et al., 2008, Herman et al., 2007, Miyai et al., 2000, Miyai et al., 2002, Pohl et al., 2003). Research has also indicated that walking with visual cues can improve aspects of gait that are impaired in PD (Azulay et al., 1999, Bagely et al., 1997, Nieuwboer et al., 2007), however, the integration of visual cues and treadmill training {{has yet to be}} studied. Thus, the purpose of this thesis was to determine the effect of treadmill training in PD, with and without the availability of concurrent visual feedback. The first chapter was focused on identifying previous exercise strategies that have been utilized in PD. Since a multitude of exercise interventions have been investigated, an evaluation of previous literature included analysis of a number of critical factors including: frequency, intensity and duration of training, the participant sample size, and outcome measures employed. Further, a review of recent PD aerobic testing and training studies guided the development of the current treadmill testing and training protocols. The second chapter examines the influence of 12 weeks of treadmill training with and without concurrent visual feedback on PD <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, physiological efficiency and gait responses at baseline, immediately after training and again six weeks later. Findings showed that the <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity scores worsened immediately after training and remained unchanged six weeks later. However, improvements in aerobic efficiency were found immediately after treadmill training that remained improved at six weeks post training. Similarly, the spatio-temporal characteristics of gait improved immediately after treadmill training and were also maintained at six weeks post training. Overall, immediately after treadmill training with concurrent visual feedback greater gait and aerobic improvements were found that did not wear off when compared to training without this feedback. The {{results of this study suggest}} that treadmill training does not improve <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity. However, treadmill training as a rehabilitative strategy can offer aerobic and gait improvements in PD. The third chapter examines the influence of 12 weeks of treadmill training in PD with and without concurrent visual feedback on the rate of perceived exertion, mean arterial pressure, timed up-and-go and Layfayette pegboard times at baseline, immediately after training and at follow up six weeks later. Across the assessments findings showed not only did the mean arterial pressure lower for both groups but also faster pegboard insertion and removal times were found. Further, trends indicated that with each successive assessment period all participants subjectively reported lower levels of required exertion for each workload and were also faster at the timed up-and-go test. Overall, regardless of group no detectable differences in the functional and clinical outcomes were found. However, after the treadmill training, decreased blood pressure along with faster fine motor control speeds indicated the range of potential benefits that can be attained from this form of training. The last chapter summarizes the principle findings of this thesis that include the physiological efficiency responses, the spatio-temporal gait changes, the <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity evaluations and the clinical and functional outcomes assessed. This chapter reviews the significant findings and intriguing trends found across the three evaluation periods that included pre-test, post-test and at follow up six weeks after training was completed. These findings are interpreted to provide a platform for the continued investigation of the effects of treadmill training in PD. Similarly, the limitations that occurred were also reviewed to emphasize the necessary considerations for future work in this area. Finally to appropriately conclude and ensure the findings are easily understood, take-home messages were provided to simplify the complex nature of this study. Treadmill training has benefits to offer the PD population that include greater aerobic efficiency and corresponding improvements in gait, however this form of exercise was not successful in <b>motor</b> <b>symptom</b> severity improvement...|$|E
