25|$|The SAE J1962 {{specification}} {{provides for}} two standardized hardware interfaces, called type A and type B. Both are female, 16-pin (2x8), D-shaped connectors, {{and both have}} a groove between the two rows of pins. But type B has the groove interrupted in the middle, so you can't plug a type A male connector into a type B socket. You can, however, mate a type B <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> in a type A female socket.|$|E

50|$|After mating {{has taken}} place, males perform various actions to prevent females from mating again. What action is {{performed}} {{depends on the}} animal. In some species, the <b>male</b> <b>plugs</b> the female copulatory duct after insemination. In some hymenoptera, the male provides a huge quantity of sperm, enough to last the females' entire life. In some birds and mammals, the male may participate in agonistic behaviors with other candidate males.|$|R

50|$|In {{electrical}} connections where voltage or current {{is sufficient to}} cause injury, the part permanently connected to the power source is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A <b>male</b> <b>plug,</b> with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device receiving the power.|$|E
50|$|The <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> is {{sometimes}} used to feed power into {{a vehicle to}} recharge its battery. For instance, portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle's battery in this manner. Trickle chargers also sometimes connect in this way, eliminating the need to leave a vehicle's hood open, as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity.|$|E
50|$|A line-operated AC string with a <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> {{on one end}} and {{a female}} socket {{on the other end}} can be {{conveniently}} connected end-to-end with other similar strings. The gauge of wire used, current rating of the fuse (if present) and the power consumption of each string will determine how many strings can be safely daisy-chained this way, or whether the end string will have diminished voltage and brightness.|$|E
5000|$|Sperm {{competition}} {{occurs in}} many species, such as Unicorn catleyi, Nephila Pilipes and Argiope aurantia, with males acting to limit it by guarding the female or inserting {{parts of the}} male genitalia into the females reproductive organs, or using mating plugs which come from the males seminal fluid. This process is observed in the species Unicorn catleyi, for example. [...] In this species, <b>males</b> <b>plug</b> a females insemination duct with {{a portion of their}} palp that contains the ejaculatory duct called the embolus. The embolus that is found in the female's posterior receptaculum suggests that males are trying to limit sperm competition.|$|R

30|$|All animal {{experiments}} were performed {{according to protocols}} approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University. Superovulated C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (6 – 8  week old females) were mated with C 57 BL/ 6  J <b>males.</b> <b>Plugged</b> females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Zygotes (0.5  day) were collected using potassium simplex optimized medium (KSOM) containing N′- 2 -Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′- 2 -ethanesulfonic acid and sodium bicarbonate (HKSOM), and cultured in KSOM until genotyping or transplantation. Embryos were in vitro cultured for 48  h before genotyping or whole genome amplification. CD 1 female mice (6 – 8  weeks old) that were mated with sterilized CD 1 male mice were used as foster mothers.|$|R
50|$|An 8P8C modular {{connection}} has two paired components: the <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> and {{the female}} jack, each with eight equally-spaced conductors. On the plug, these conductors are flat contacts positioned parallel with the connector body. Inside the jack, the contacts are suspended diagonally toward the insertion interface. When an 8P8C plug is mated with an 8P8C jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. Spring tension in the jack's contacts ensures a good interface with the plug and allows for slight travel during insertion and removal.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{computerized}} sets {{cannot be}} connected end-to-end. However, some newer sets contain special miniature plugs - a female jack {{is located at}} the end of the set, and a <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> is located between the control box and the beginning of the actual lights. By disconnecting the control box from one set, it can now be plugged into the end of an identical chasing set to produce a longer strand of chasing lights. These plugs generally have a twist-on locking feature similar to that found on garden hoses.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Base" [...] Camera Link {{configuration}} carries signals over {{a single}} connector/cable. The cable used is a MDR ("Mini D Ribbon") 26-pin <b>Male</b> <b>Plug</b> Connector, optimized by 3M for the LVDS signal. In {{addition to the}} 5 LVDS pairs transmitting the serialized video data (24 bits of data and 4 framing/enable bits), the connector also carries 4 LVDS discrete control signals and 2 LVDS asynchronous serial communication channels for communicating with the camera. At the maximum chipset operating frequency (85 MHz), the base configuration yields a video data throughput of 2.04 Gbit/s (255 MB/s).|$|E

50|$|B. terrestris is a singly mating species. Mating with {{multiple}} males might provide benefits of genetic variability among the brood, {{but it does}} not happen in this or any but the most highly derived social bees. The lack of multiple matings by B. terrestris queens may be partly due to male interference. B. terrestris <b>males</b> <b>plug</b> the female's sexual tract with a sticky secretion during mating, which appears to reduce the female's ability to successfully mate with other males for several days. However honeybee <b>males</b> also <b>plug</b> the female's reproductive tract to no avail; honeybees mate tens of times on one mating flight. While there may be genetic fitness benefits in colony heterogeneity from a polyandrous mating system, bumblebees are also likely to be monandrous due to social constraints, risks associated {{with multiple}} matings, and phylogenetic inertia since the ancestral bees are singly mated. Finding multiple mates might be energetically costly and expose the queen to higher predation risks. Additionally, while queens may prefer multiple matings to ensure more genetic variability and viable offspring, workers are more closely related to full sisters than to paternal half sisters. This is due to haplodiploidy in Hymenopteran social insects in which males (drones) are haploid and females (workers and queens) are diploid. This confers greater genetic similarity between sister workers (relatedness of 0.75) than between mother and offspring (relatedness of 0.5), making the relatedness component of kin selection higher between sisters.|$|R
40|$|The University of Southern Queensland {{has entered}} {{a team in}} the 2004 Formula SAE-A competition. That team {{comprises}} nine people, each of whom are designing a different system for the USQ's inaugural entry into the F-SAE-A competition. This project deals with {{the design of the}} bodywork. By looking at the solid modelling, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and manufacturing aspects of this design, I intend to have designed by October, and constructed by December, 2004, a fully functional bodywork package for the vehicle. Using a solid modelling package, the shape will be developed, then transferred into a CFD software package and analysed. If it is satisfactory, the solid model will be used to create full-size <b>male</b> <b>plugs,</b> which will be used to shape the bodywork. Factors that will influence the design include its aerodynamic performance in the CFD analyses, its aesthetic appeal (this may invite sponsorship), and its ability to be manufactured. A great aerodynamic design has no use if it cannot be manufactured. These factors, and more, will be investigated {{during the course of this}} project...|$|R
50|$|Plug and socket {{connectors}} {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> (typically pin contacts) and a female receptacle (typically socket contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN connector. Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|E
50|$|A {{cord set}} {{includes}} connectors molded to the cord {{at each end}} (see Appliance coupler). Cord sets are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the cord set {{is attached to a}} molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.|$|E
5000|$|A Motorola {{connector}} {{also known}} as a motorola antenna plug is a common coaxial cable RF connector used primarily in the automotive industry for connecting the coaxial feedline from the antenna to the radio receiver. It is also sometimes used for connecting scanner antennas to scanners. The <b>male</b> <b>plug</b> somewhat resembles an RCA connector in size and shape, but instead of being concentric to the pin, the sleeve is [...] "folded" [...] back over the coax. The pin is soldered to the center conductor of the coaxial cable coming from the antenna, and the grounded side forms a 1.5 inch (38 mm) long sleeve around the coax. The sleeve usually contains one or more longitudinal spring surfaces, which provide reliable electrical contact by wiping against the mating female socket.|$|E
5000|$|In {{low-voltage}} {{use such}} as for data communications, electrical shock hazard {{is not an}} issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common [...] "patch cables" [...] used for Ethernet (and the similar cords used for telephones) typically have <b>male</b> modular <b>plugs</b> on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.|$|R
50|$|A very-high-density cable {{interconnect}} (VHDCI) is a 68-pin connector {{that was}} introduced in the SPI-3 document of SCSI-3. The VHDCI connector is a very small connector that allows placement of four wide SCSI connectors {{on the back of a}} single PCI card slot. Physically, it looks like a miniature Centronics type connector. It uses the regular 68-contact pin assignment. The <b>male</b> connector (<b>plug)</b> is used on the cable and the female connector ("receptacle") on the device.|$|R
50|$|To {{play the}} game, you must first {{purchase}} the Starter Kit, containing a DNA extractor gun, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the Xtractaurs installation CD. You first must insert the CD into your computer {{to install the}} Xtractaurs software. Once installed, you can open the software, create an account (You must have Broadband Internet connection to play online), and can plug in your DNA extractor gun with a cable on {{the handle of the}} gun, which ends in a <b>male</b> USB <b>plug.</b> You are now ready for extraction. Your T-rex has a female TRS port, much like the one in an iPod or iPhone, in its thigh (as all dinosaurs under the brand do on a part of their body), and is compatible with a <b>male</b> TRS <b>plug</b> on the barrel of the extractor gun. When you plug the two, a display will appear on your screen showing a DNA strand. This means that electronics in the dinosaur are sending signals through the gun, through the cable, and into your computer. When done, an online version of your dinosaur pops up onto your screen. From there, you can play online games with your dinosaur, and begin your Xtractaurs adventure.|$|R
