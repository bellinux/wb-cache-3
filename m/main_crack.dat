50|$|Inclusions in a {{material}} {{such as a}} second phase particles can act similar to brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture {{is most likely to}} occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup back to the <b>main</b> <b>crack.</b> If the plastic zone is small or the density of the inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> tip. If the plastic zone is large, or the density of inclusions is high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the plastic zone, and linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion within the zone.|$|E

The results of experiments using the high-current pulse generator with operating voltage up to 15 kV and maximum stored energy of 126 kJ with initiation of the discharge in two boreholes were presented. The step by step electro-blast were produced simultaneous within boreholes drilled in the cast in the ground concrete monolith. Each subsequent electro-blast was performed in the boreholes pair situated farther from the free surface. Boreholes in each pair were drilled {{at a distance of}} 30 - 40 cm from each other, and of 25 cm apart from line of previous pair. It is shown that the electro-blasts leads to formation of <b>main</b> <b>cracks</b> at the predefined direction via boreholes line as well as <b>main</b> <b>cracks</b> lead to creation of a new free surfacethat help to form the desirable wave interference at the next step of the electro-blast...|$|R

50|$|Extrinsic {{toughening}} {{mechanisms are}} processes which act behind the crack tip to resist its further opening. Examples include fibre/lamella bridging, where these structures hold the two fracture surfaces together after the crack has propagated through the matrix, crack wedging from the friction between two rough fracture surfaces, microcracking, where smaller cracks {{form in the}} material around the <b>main</b> <b>crack,</b> relieving the stress at the crack tip by effectively increasing the material's compliance, and transformation toughening.|$|E

50|$|At higher temperatures, {{the yield}} {{strength}} decreases, {{and leads to}} the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness.|$|E

30|$|Figure  10 b {{shows the}} {{relation}} between AE hits and stress level under monotonic compression. The relation of the cumulative AE hits versus the normalized time is plotted in Fig.  10 b. It is noted that the AE hits increase first at a slow rate before the stress reaches the peak strength. At this interval, only few AE signals are captured by the sensors. However, when the stress reaches the peak stress, {{a large amount of}} AE hits are observed accounted for the unstable crack propagation. The AE signals have a concentrated release, with the cracks in concrete specimen generating, nucleating, intersecting and finally forming into the <b>main</b> <b>cracks.</b> After the peak stress, a sharp increase in AE hits is observed. The damage at this stage has a very quick development, with an obvious decrease in the axial load. After that, the AE hits are few, resulted in a slow increase in the cumulative AE hits. The damage of concrete specimen at this interval is mainly caused by the <b>main</b> <b>cracks</b> and the damage index at this stage is verging to a constant approaching to one. From the above analysis, it is noted that the releasing process of AE signals is closely related to the damage process of concrete. Roughly speaking, the variation process of the cumulative AE hits can be used to represent the damage evolution of concrete.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} crack extension behaviors for a linear elastic {{body with a}} parallel interacting crack at the neighborhood of the <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> tip. We compute the energy release rate for all the crack tips {{at the onset of}} a <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> kinking : E integral is path independent even for a path containing a kinking crack tip and/or the interacting crack tips; however, for such cases, the well-known J-integral is not path independent. As a result, assuming the isotropy of fracture toughness of the body and judging from the criterion based on the energy release rate, we find that there exist the relative positions of the interacting crack which promote or interrupt the straight extension of the <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> and which make the <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> jump to an extension of an interacting crack...|$|E

This increase in the tensile strain is attributed to the concentration of the stresses along the shear path (line connecting the load point and the support) due to the relative displacement between the two of the <b>main</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quantitative Acoustic Emission (QAE) technology, {{physical}} and mathematical models were {{created for the}} reliable identification and evaluation of the danger level (the J-integral value) of a developing <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> {{in a system of}} interacting micro- cracks. They also enabled the reliable assessment of the remaining lifetime of low density polyethylene (LDPE) reactor tubes that contain cracks. These innovations made it possible to carry out pioneer investigations and establish previously unknown dependences, phenomena and criteria, such as: • Interdependence between the J-integral value of the revealed flaw and the remaining lifetime of steel tubes that contain a system of inclusions, micro-cracks or had undergone stress corrosion cracking (SCC) attack and/or hydrogen embrittlement. • Criteria for tube rejection. • The optimal interval between repeated inspections (monitoring) of the reactor together with the time of analysis and decision. • Criteria for acceptable flaw danger level that would allow continued use of tubes in operation for two years. We established that a <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> in a system of micro-cracks under dynamic pulse loading could start to propagate earlier and faster, and reach greater lengths and take longer time to brake than an individual <b>main</b> <b>crack.</b> At the same time it was shown that the remaining lifetime could significantly decrease when a <b>main</b> <b>crack</b> interact...|$|E

30|$|According to {{the results}} above, the micro-structure of the as-cast Al–Cu–Mn alloy is {{relatively}} loose bits of aperture formed on fracture sections during the casting and cooling process which relates to {{the properties of the}} studied alloy. A large number of small and shallow dimples indicate the tendency of ductile fractures of as-cast alloy. However, the smooth and large particles on the cross section are incoherently arranged and lamellar compounds and the particle gaps emerged at the junction of large particles. Al–Cu–Mn alloy presents brittle fractures in those weak positions under additional tensile stress due to the poor degree of inter-granular connections. Meanwhile, gaps between large particles are also equivalent to micro-crack sources. Once stress is generated, micro-cracks will converge to grow and connect the <b>main</b> <b>cracks</b> which are blocked at GBs and consequently the as-cast alloy shows brittle fractures.|$|R
