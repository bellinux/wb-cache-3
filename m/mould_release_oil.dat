The type of <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> technology used has a direct effect on the surface finish of fair-faced concrete, and this in turn affects long-term durability. This work examined two <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> agents (MRAs), one permeable formwork liner and a type 1 polypropylene fibre concrete combined with a single MRA. Cubes were cast in film-faced plywood moulds using C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the MRAs. The pilot study examined a range of variables for two different reactive MRAs (FS (petroleum based) and CL (vegetable <b>oil</b> based)). The <b>release</b> agents used are commercially available as reactive-based MRAs. In addition, controlled permeability formwork (CPF) and a concrete mix with polypropylene fibre additions were used. The pilot study results showed that the CPF liner produced the least number of blowholes and, in that respect, was the best performing technology used. Consequently, the CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long-term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, but the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring. Two of the best performing <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> products (CPF and FS) were then tested using a high-resolution optical measurement system and the initial results were examined in much greater detail, taking account of surface roughness, pore volume and pore size.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive and renewable energy generation, has driven {{a need for a}} greater understanding of the fracture behaviour of bonded composite joints. An important prerequisite for the adhesive bonding of composites is the existence of a uniform surface free from contaminants and <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> agents. While there are several ways in which this may be achieved, the use of peel plies has emerged as the preferred choice for many industries due to the repeatable nature of the resulting surface, particularly in the highly regulated aerospace industry. The use of peel plies can present some problems. It is possible that contamination from the peel ply can be transferred to the composite substrate and adversely affect the adhesive joint [1]. Plasma treatments have been shown to improve the fracture toughness of adhesively bonded composite joints [2] and can be used to remove contaminants, such as <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> agents, from the surface [3]. The aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of various peel ply treatments on the mode I fracture toughness of different aerospace grade bonded composite joints and to assess the subsequent benefits of employing an atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) surface treatment prior to adhesive bonding in each case...|$|R

E., SUTHERLAND, I., GRANDY, D. B. and WILSON, S., 2005. A review and comparative study of release coatings for optimised abhesion in resin transfer moulding applications. International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives is available at: www. elsevier. com/locate/ijadhadhIn this study, a number of abhesion promoting coatings were considered in terms of their physicochemical and release properties. The techniques used to further this study include; FEGSEM, AFM, profilometry, AFM, XPS, AES, SSIMS, FTIR and contact angle analysis for coating physical and chemical characterisation along with PF-AFM and other adhesion and mechanical tests to determine surface release properties. These coatings were applied to metal substrates and were based upon silicone, fluoropolymer or metal-PTFE composite chemistry, all being potentially useful as release films for resin transfer moulding (RTM) applications. The semi-permanent Frekote B 15 / 710 NC <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> coating system, which is based on PDMS, proved extremely effective in terms of release against a cured epoxide applied under pressure. Although fluoroalkylsilane coatings offer a number of technological advantages for release applications they generally produce very thin coatings which conform any existing surface topography and adhesion through mechanical interlocking occurs. The commercial PTFE-based coatings were found to provide poor release properties due to the presence of surface microcracks which allowed epoxide penetration when cured under elevated pressure and temperature. Electroless Ni/PTFE composite coatings comprise hard nickel-phosphorus matrix containing a very fine dispersion of PTFE particles. The matrix proved sufficiently robust for industrial applications and the low friction and surface energy provided by the embedded PTFE combined with macroscopic scale surface roughness provided efficient <b>mould</b> <b>release...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{development}} and study of erosion wear behaviors of poly ether ether ketone(PEEK) - Glass-fiber (GF) and PEEK-GF-REDMUD composites. This work, study of its various mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength and density. This work also includes erosion behaviors wrt. Varying Velocity and angle of impact of erodent. Comparison of properties of PEEK-GF and PEEK-GF REDMUD composites gives a detailed idea {{about the effect of}} REDMUD in PEEK-GF composites. For preparation of the composites clean glass plates were taken. <b>Mould</b> <b>release</b> sheets were placed on the plates. <b>Mould</b> <b>release</b> spray was applied on them. The catalyst and accelerator were added to the polyester in proportion 1. 5 % and 1 % respectively and are thoroughly mixed. For preparation of different composites i. e. is neat PEEK-GF composite, Red mud filling PEEKGF composite, this mixture was sprayed on the sheets to a thickness of about 2 mm followed by a piece of glass fiber mat(cut {{in the shape of a}} rectangle). Again another layer of resin was sprayed. Thus a single layer of composite is formed. Load was applied on all these preparations and these were left for 48 hours for adequate curing and solidification. Then the <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> sheets were removed and molded composites were taken out. It may be mentioned that in all these composites the fiber orientation was set at 90 0. The important factors influencing the erosion rate of materials are the impact velocity, impact angle of erodent particles, the size, shape and hardness of eroding particles. This has been reported by a number of researchers for a wide range of materials and erodent. Many Investigators have used angular silica sand, alumina, corundum particles or irregular silicon Carbide abrasives. In the present study dry silica sand is used as erodent. Hence it is difficult to compare present erosion data precisely with literature data. It can be concluded that reinforcement of glass fiber into the PEEK matrix improves the flexural strength quite significantly, thus making them potential materials for structural applications. Addition of Red Mud to glass fiber reinforced composites also enhances the flexural strength, flexural modulus and tensile strength of the material. PEEK with glass fiber reinforcement exhibits better resistance to solid particle erosion in comparison to the un-reinforced PEEK resin. The rate of wear of the composite material is also greatly influenced by operational variables like impact angle and the velocity of impact. Further, material variables like erodent and type of composite also affect the erosion rate. The neat PEEK and 20 % red mud filling of glass fiber reinforced PEEK composite exhibited maximum erosion rate at an impingement angle of 60 0 under the present experimental conditions studied...|$|R
50|$|Sides of {{the part}} that appear {{parallel}} with the direction of draw (the axis of the cored position (hole) or insert {{is parallel to the}} up and down movement of the mould as it opens and closes) are typically angled slightly, called draft, to ease release {{of the part}} from the mould. Insufficient draft can cause deformation or damage. The draft required for <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> is primarily dependent on the depth of the cavity: the deeper the cavity, the more draft necessary. Shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining the draft required. If the skin is too thin, then the moulded part will tend to shrink onto the cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores, or the part may warp, twist, blister or crack when the cavity is pulled away.|$|R
