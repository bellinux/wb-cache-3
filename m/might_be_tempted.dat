5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to join Lee's army.|$|E
25|$|The Mosquito flew {{its last}} {{official}} European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF {{were ordered to}} continue to hunt German submarines that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats.|$|E
25|$|It {{was thought}} that commanders <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to think of the}} Armadillo as a mobile pillbox rather than any sort of tank or {{armoured}} car. To counter such a view, instructions emphasised its use as a mobile unit, not a static fort and it was to be reserved for the defence of the airfield and not given other tasks such as transporting ammunition or being driven off to find parachutists.|$|E

But an early entry into the NFL <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> if he's assured of first-round draft status.|$|R
40|$|It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> to conclude, {{giving the}} {{prominence}} of male writers in the Hungarian canon, that until the late 20 th century the question of women writers was rarely raised, if it all, and the contributions of women writers were peripheral. This conclusion, however, would be unfounded. Women writers have been significant in the Hungarian literary tradition for several centuries, as notable examples clearly illustrate...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) {{has a long}} history; {{as a matter of}} fact, it has been developing at an unprecedented pace in the recent years. The swift development <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> for observers to suppose that CSR is evolving into a permanent phenomenon, embodying a new form of business-society relationship at both national and international level. Naturally, the reality is always more complex than it might seem at first sight...|$|R
25|$|It is {{this second}} step {{which makes the}} {{technique}} one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling {{the selection of the}} sample is non-random. For example, interviewers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to interview those who look most helpful. The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. This random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, British {{counter-intelligence}} {{was directed}} at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy {{in the face of}} Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort {{was directed at}} intercepting the Kabul Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{confusion}} over the name: Given that Aditinngithigh and ‘Arritinngithigh’ {{seem to have been}} identified with only one estate each and the names are so similar, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> to consider their distinct spellings a mere artifact of the recording process, but the names are indeed distinct and moreover the relevant estate are noncontiguous and owned by different people.

40|$|Based on {{recently}} published papers, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> to routinely apply the beta-binomial model {{to obtain a}} single administration estimate of the reliability of a mastery test. Using real data, the paper illustrates two practical problems with estimating reliability in this manner. The first is that the model might give a poor fit to data, which can seriously affect the reliability estimate, {{and the second is}} that inadmissible estimates of the parameters in the beta-binomial model <b>might</b> <b>be</b> obtained. Two possible solutions are described and illustrated...|$|R
50|$|It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> to {{speculate}} that areas of the skin that are the most sensitive to touch would also be the most ticklish, {{but this does not}} seem to be the case. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, most people find that the soles of their feet are the most ticklish. Other commonly ticklish areas include the underarms, sides of the torso, neck, knee, midriff, perineum, navel, and the ribs.|$|R
25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|Robertson wanted {{industrial}} conscription, {{national service}} for men up {{the age of}} 55, and 900,000 new army recruits, similar to the new German Hindenburg Programme. He was concerned at the Asquith Coalition's lack of firm leadership, once likening the Cabinet to “a committee of lunatics”, and although he avoided taking sides in party politics he urged {{the creation of a}} small War Committee which would simply give orders to the departmental ministers, and was concerned (letter to Hankey, 9 November) that ministers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to make peace or else to reduce Britain’s Western Front commitment. Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace “cranks, cowards and philosophers … miserable members of society”).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the war, shelter policy had been determined by Sir John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal and, on the declaration of war, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. Anderson announced the policy to Parliament on 20 April 1939, based on a report from a committee chaired by Lord Hailey. This reaffirmed a policy of dispersal and eschewed the use of deep shelters, including the use of tube stations and underground tunnels as public shelters. Reasons given were the spread of disease due to the lack of toilet facilities at many stations, the inherent danger of people falling onto the lines, and that people sheltering in the stations and tunnels <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to stay in them day and night because they would feel safer there than outside the stations.|$|E

25|$|In many states, {{fundamental}} mistakes, misrepresentations {{and similar}} defects {{may make a}} contract void ab initio, i.e. the defect is so serious that it prevents an agreement from ever coming into being. If this happens, every term in the contract including the express selection of the proper law, would be unenforceable. This {{raises the question of}} whether the lex fori should operate a policy of saving the validity of contracts wherever possible. Suppose that a contract would be valid under many potentially relevant laws but not under the putative proper law, and that, until problems arose, the parties have acted in good faith on the assumption that they will be bound by the agreement, some courts <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to ignore the apparent proper law and choose another that would give effect to the parties general contractual intentions.|$|E
25|$|After the Chilean {{occupation}} of Arica, Tarapacá and Antofagasta, {{the governments of}} Peru and Bolivia turned to the United States of America to block Chilean annexation of the occupied territories as their last hope. US diplomats were worried that European powers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to intervene in the}} Pacific. The Bolivian Minister in Washington offered US-Secretary of State William Maxwell Evarts the prospects of lucrative guano and nitrate concessions to US investors in return for official protection of Bolivia's territorial integrity. Isaac P. Christiancy, US Minister in Peru, organized the USS Lackwanna conference, which ultimately failed as none of the belligerents was ready to negotiate their pretensions. Earlier, Christiancy had written to the USA that Peru should be annexed for a period of ten years, then admitted in the Union to provide the United States with access to the rich markets of South America.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{were not}} {{committed}} {{in the heat of}} sudden passion for some fancied wrong: they were the result of a deliberate system. The wronged individual laid his case before a quasijudicial tribunal demanding the death, say, of a mining boss and urging his reasons. If they were satisfactory, as they usually were, the murder was decreed; but the task was not assigned to the aggrieved person or to any one in his and the victim's neighborhood: perhaps directly aggrieved parties <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> to use more force or more cruelty than necessary. Two or more relatively disinterested Mollies from {{a different part of the}} county or even from the adjoining county were selected to do the killing because, being unknown, they could the more easily escape detection. Refusal to carry out the dictate of the conclave was dangerous and seldom happened, although an arrangement of substitution, if properly supported, was permitted. The meeting generally took place in an upper room of a hotel or saloon and, after the serious business, came the social reunion with deep libations of whiskey.|$|E

But don't be mistaken, Cassidy was a huge talent, whose obscurity during her lifetime was almost as much a tragedy as her early death." [...] Songbird has since achieved significant chart success throughout Europe and six times platinum status in the UK. Although still relatively unknown in the United States at that time, the album would eventually be certified gold in the United States as well.|$|E

Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?"

500|$|Shortly before Naomi's first {{scenes were}} broadcast, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that she would test one of the show's established relationships by setting her sights on a married man. Cast member Ryan Moloney, who plays Toadfish Rebecchi, previously hinted that his character <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> by another woman and it was later confirmed that Naomi would develop feelings for Toadie. The storyline began shortly after Toadie hired Naomi to be his new personal assistant at his law office. While Naomi ran the office well, Toadie's wife, Sonya (Eve Morey) did not fully trust her, even after she helped Sonya out with a business problem. Naomi later convinced Toadie that Sonya would be a liability if she attended a meeting with some important clients with him, and then made sure that Sonya was busy when the meeting took place. Sheila, noticing her daughter's [...] "intimate" [...] celebrations with Toadie at the office, then accused her of trying to seduce another married man. This prompted Naomi to arrange a romantic evening for Toadie and Sonya, while she had dinner with Paul to throw Sheila off the scent.|$|E
500|$|The East Persian Cordon (later {{called the}} Seistan Force), {{consisting}} of British Indian Army troops, {{was established in}} the Sistan province of south-east Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from Damani, Reki, and Kurdish Balushi tribes who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> by German gold. The 2nd Quetta Brigade, a small force maintained in Western Balochistan {{since the beginning of the}} war, was expanded in July 1915 and became the East Persia Cordon, with troops stationed from Russian Turkestan to Baluchistan. A similar Russian cordon was established to prevent infiltration into north-west Afghanistan. From March 1916 the force was renamed the Seistan Force, under the direction of General George Macaulay Kirkpatrick, the Chief of the General Staff in India. The cordon was initially under the command of Colonel J. M. Wilkeley before it was taken over by Reginald Dyer in February 1916. The cordon's task was to [...] "intercept, capture or destroy any German parties attempting to enter Sistan or Afghanistan", to establish an intelligence system, and to watch the Birjand-Merked road. Persian subjects were not to be targeted as long as they were not accompanying Germans or acting as their couriers, and as long as Persia remained neutral. Following the Revolution in Russia, the Malleson Mission was sent to Trans-Caspia and the Seistan Force became the main line of communication for the mission. With the withdrawal of the force from Trans-Caspia, the troops in Persia were withdrawn; the last elements left in November 1920.|$|E
500|$|The Titan's Curse {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{which often}} lauded the humor and {{action in the}} story. Children's Literature, which commended the book's fast pace and humor, wrote, [...] "Readers will relate to good natured Percy, the protagonist."

[...] School Library Journal praised the [...] "adventurous" [...] plot as well as the book's appeal: [...] "Teachers will cheer for Percy Jackson and the Olympians as they inspire students to embrace Greek mythology and score the ultimate Herculean challenge: getting kids to read. All in all, a winner of Olympic proportions and a surefire read-aloud." [...] Booklist's starred review approved of the novel's humor action, and plotting: [...] "The Percy Jackson & the Olympians series is built around a terrific idea—that the half-mortal offspring of Greek gods live among us, playing out struggles of mythic scale—and Riordan takes it from strength to strength with this exciting installment, adding even more depth to the characters and story arc while retaining its predecessors' nonstop laughs and action." [...] Kidsreads raved, [...] "Rick Riordan's Olympian adventures have gained great popularity thanks to their combination of humor, adventure and a winning hero ...
