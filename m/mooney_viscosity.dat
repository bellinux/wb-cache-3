TiO 2 is also known to have an outstanding photocatalytic activity. This work investigates the properties of natural rubber (NR) compounds filled with 5 phr of nano-TiO 2 (n-TiO 2). Since the direct incorporation of n-TiO 2 into NR encounters incompatibility problem, therefore two types of coupling agent (i. e. bis-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) and isopropyl trioleyl titanate (ITT)) are used. The coupling agent loading is varied {{in a range of}} 0 - 20 wt % relative to the n-TiO 2. <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscosities</b> and minimum cure torque (ML) of the compounds increase with increasing coupling agent content and the ones with ITT show higher viscosity than the mixes with TESPT. The use of TESPT leads to shorter optimum cure time and higher torque difference compared to the use of ITT. The addition of n-TiO 2 results in the improved modulus, reinforcing index and tensile strength compared to the unfilled vulcanizate. The presence of both TESPT and ITT significantly reduces a photodegradation efficiency. The difference in the properties and photocatalytic activity of n-TiO 2 filled NR having TESPT and ITT as coupling agent indicates their possible different level of dispersion and interactions at the interphases...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to elucidate the viscosity reduction mechanisms in polymer blends containing thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP). We have observed drastic bulk viscosity reductions (> 95 %) in PE/TLCP blend containing very small quantity of TLCP (< 1 wt%). In addition, a significant improvement in extrudate surface smoothness has also been observed coupled by the increase in processing window from 34 s- 1 to up to 1000 s- 1 of apparent shear rate. Systematic investigations using, rheo-optical, rheo-Raman, SIMS, XPS, SEM and TEM techniques lead {{to the conclusion that}} oriented TLCP induces PE configuration transition from random coils to extended chains that gives rise to such drastic viscosity reduction. Firstly, systematic rheological measurements were performed in terms of effect of TLCP melt structure, matrix molecular structure and average molecular weight and wall slip. It is observed that the viscosity changes can be brought about only if the matrix and TLCP share similar molecular structures. The viscosity reduction is more significant for higher molecular weight system and a negative wall slip is observed in the <b>Mooney</b> analysis. <b>Viscosity</b> reduction ability of TLCP is stronger when the TLCP is in its fully nematic phase compared with the isotropic phase. Such ability is improved when the isotropic TLCP phase is undergone the shear induced isotropic-nematic transition at the higher apparent shear rate region. Secondly, the melt interactions between TLCP and PE melt were investigated using the rheo-optical and rheo-micro-raman spectroscopy. It has been observed that the TLCP domain structure has a significant effect on PE crystallization kinetics. An elongated TLCP domain acts as a nucleating site for the row nucleated crystals in PE whereas an un-orientated TLCP domain shows no such effect. Thirdly, the surface composition analysis on the extrudate surfaces using ToF-SIMS and XPS shows that the extrudate surface is depleted from TLCP as compared with the bulk. However, the surface is covered with a film of anti-oxidant rich PE film, explaining why wall slip is absent. Finally, the SEM and TEM analysis show that the flow induced TLCP filaments have strong effects on the lamella orientation in PE phase. There is a global or long-range orientation of PE molecules on the extrudate surface which have molecular axis parallel to TLCP fibers. Additionally, TEM reveals inter- diffusion of PE chains to TLCP phase, suggesting strong compatibility between two phases. The viscosity reduction is proposed and formulated into the binary flow pattern which is proved to be able to well model the experimental rheological responses...|$|R

Traditionally carbon black {{has been used as}} the reinforcing filler by the rubber industry. Although silica filler has been available for a long time its use has been restncted due to low reinforcement provided by silica. There are also processing problems peculiar to the use of silica, like long cure time and high viscosity. ThiS not only decreases the service life of the equipment due to increased wear and tear but also restricts commercial manufacture of silica-based products due to long cycle times. Blfunctional organosilanes have been used to improve reinforcement in rubber compounds. They react With the polymer on one hand and with the hydrophilic silica filler on the other. In this study the effect of an organosilane, bls(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphane (TESPT), was systematically studied on fifteen rubber compounds. The variables used were the amount of silane and the filler silica (60, 30, and 10 p. p. h r.). An attempt was made to find the amount of TESPT to be used to obtain optimum processing and reinforcing properties. The processing properties measured were cure time, scorch time, cure rate index and <b>Mooney</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The reinforcement was measured by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum rheometer torques (A Torque) and by bound rubber measurements. Cross-link density measurements were also made on the compounds containing 30 p. p. h. r. silica.
