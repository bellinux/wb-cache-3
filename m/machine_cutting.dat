60|$|An {{hour before}} daylight, when he deemed that the enemy's {{vigilance}} would be relaxed, Walter caused himself with Ralph and twelve of his men-at-arms {{to be lowered}} by ropes from the wall. Each rope had a loop at the bottom in which one foot was placed, and knots were tied {{in order to give}} a better grasp for the hands. They were lowered at a short distance from the spot at which the machine was at work; all were armed with axes, and they made their way unperceived until within a few yards of the wagon. Then there was a cry of alarm, and in a moment they rushed forward among the enemy. The men working the machine were instantly cut down, and Walter and his party fell upon the <b>machine,</b> <b>cutting</b> the ropes and smashing the wheels and pulleys and hewing away at the timber itself. In a minute or two, however, they were attacked by the enemy, the officer in command having bade a hundred men lie down to sleep close behind the machine in case the garrison should attempt a sortie. Walter called upon Ralph and four of the men-at-arms to stand beside him while the others continued their work of destruction. The French came up in a tumultuous body, but, standing so far apart that they could wield their axes, the English dealt such destruction among their first assailants that these for a time recoiled. As fresh numbers came up, encouraged by their leader they renewed the attack, and in spite of the most tremendous efforts Walter and his party were driven back. By this time, however, so much damage had been done to the machine that it would be some hours before it could be repaired, even if spare ropes and other appliances had been brought with it from Amiens; so that, reinforced by the working party, Walter was again able to hold his ground and after repulsing a fresh onslaught of the enemy he gave the word for his men to retire at full speed.|$|E

50|$|Much {{importance}} {{has been}} given to the country’s industrialisation even before freedom was won (1947), but credit must be given to Naval for taking the initiative in manufacturing machine tools nearly a decade earlier. The opportunity came during the war years when the machines required by Godrej could no longer be imported. Naval rose to the challenge and in the 1940s, he created a path-breaking line of machines including the first 35 tonne power press. He also pioneered the indigenous manufacture of machine tools & metal forming and <b>machine</b> <b>cutting</b> machines.|$|E

5000|$|The master {{diamond cutter}} Gabi Tolkowsky created the Asprey cut. The cushion cut gave Tolkowsky options for {{incorporating}} the Asprey [...] "A" [...] inscription {{around the edges}} of the stone. The result was the 61-facet Asprey cut, maximising light refraction to brilliant effect. Carat weights of Asprey-cut diamonds range from 0.50 to 3. Asprey-cut diamonds are inscribed on one side of the cushion with the GIA certificate number and with four distinctive 'A's on the other. It is also the only diamond that has the letter [...] "A" [...] on the crown; the Asprey cut has a flower in the centre to create softness. The shape of the Asprey cut means that the cutting process can be done only by hand, unlike many other stones that involve <b>machine</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|E

His first tutor in Cambridge was the English mathematician George Peacock (then Cambridges Lowndean Professor of Astronomy {{and a friend}} of Charles Babbage). Among Boultons earliest accomplishments was earning the Eton Prize in February 1839 for his essay, The Decline and Fall of the Persian Empire, and an award for his collection of witty epigrams at Cambridge University in 1841. He also won two of Cambridges Sir William Browne Medals for Latin and Greek poetry. Dr. Chris Upton of Birmhinghams Newman University wrote on Boultons 1841 Latin poem Vehicula vi vaporis impulsa, roughly meaning [...] "Vehicles driven by the power of steam". Describing Boultons poem in an English rendering, Upton wrote: [...] "Devilish" [...] he calls the <b>machine,</b> <b>cutting</b> through the middle of mountains, slicing through the countryside.
