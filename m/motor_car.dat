5|$|On 26 March 1957, <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> 66.03 {{and center}} car 18821 were damaged {{in a fire}} at Kristiansand. Both were retired due to the large damages. On 8 June 1969, a unit derailed at between Eidanger and Oklungen, but was restored. <b>Motor</b> <b>car</b> 66.02 was exposed to a fire on 4 June 1975, and again on 28 December 1976. After the latter incident, the car was retired.|$|E
5|$|London Underground {{has owned}} {{a small number}} of {{departmental}} vehicles which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars. Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock driving <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> and a control trailer. The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second <b>motor</b> <b>car,</b> to provide more power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock was}} divided into two pools: A 'main line stock' pool {{composing}} 263 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 248 trailers. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were the 101 new <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> together with all the C, D, E and G Stock motor and trailers; these all received new motors. These ran with 248 trailers of the wooden B Stock, 152 of these <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with the <b>motors</b> removed. A small pool of 'local stock', 37 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 18 control trailers worked the Acton Town shuttles to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow. In 1930 these <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were fitted with GE212 motors available stock recently replaced on the Watford Joint Line.|$|R

5|$|Middleton was {{the manager}} of the local Middleton <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Company and the son of a California timber baron. He {{introduced}} Michelena to his society friends and business partners, including the trustees of Charles Crocker's estate who had rebuilt the St. Francis Hotel after the 1906 earthquake and fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} winter {{service vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even road surface for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> traffic and aviation in the early 20th century {{led to the development}} and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.|$|E
5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

25|$|Not {{counting}} the two Composite prototypes, the IRT received 500 Composites: 340 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 160 trailers. Estimates by IRT engineers required a 3:1 ratio of <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> to trailer cars. Therefore, when the 300 Gibbs Hi-V motors {{were added to}} these numbers, the new totals were 640 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 160 trailers. This was a surplus of <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> Shortly after delivery, therefore, the IRT began converting <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> into trailers. As all Gibbs Hi-V <b>cars</b> were <b>motors,</b> the preference was to keep them that way while converting more Composite motors into trailers. By 1910, 208 of the 340 motorized Composite cars had been converted into trailers.|$|R

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Bloomberg Businessweek ranked Dayton in 2010 {{as one of}} {{the best}} places in the U.S. for college {{graduates}} looking for a job. Companies such as Reynolds and Reynolds, CareSource, DPL, LexisNexis, Kettering Health Network, Premier Health Partners, and Standard Register have their headquarters in Dayton. It is also the former home of the Speedwell <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Company, MeadWestvaco (formerly known as the Mead Paper Company), and NCR. NCR was headquartered in Dayton for over 125 years and was a major innovator in computer technology.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the new El 13 {{locomotives}} were delivered, and locomotive-hauled express trains {{replaced the}} multiple units. From 28 May 1967, Class 66 {{was moved to}} serve the Vestfold Line. It operated in services to Skien until 3 June 1973, after which it only served to Larvik. During the summer of 1975, they could also be seen operating OsloV – Nelaug, and during the fall of 1976 on OsloV – Drammen. The units were taken out of service on 21 May 1977. A single <b>motor</b> <b>car,</b> 66.01, has been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Museum, who has stationed it at Elverum Station.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the units}} were {{reformed}} into 2-car sets, 14 driving trailers were provided for 16 driving <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> {{because it was}} found that the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> required more time under maintenance.|$|R
25|$|Class 88 was a three-car diesel-hydraulic {{standard}} gauge multiple unit. Each {{consisted of two}} powered <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with a driver's cab and an un-powered center <b>car.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were initially designated Bmdo Class 1, but were shortly afterwards classified as Cmdo Class 8. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were numbered 18282–89 and the center cars 18951–54. They were reclassified and renumbered in 1956; the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> became Bmdo 88, numbered 88.02–09, the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> with kitchen classified as BEmdo 88 and the center cars as Bo3e. The center cars retained their old numbers. The first series of trains were classified as the a-series, the second as the b-series. The latter were delivered with the numbers 88.10–13 and the center cars as 18956–57. All the center cars took the new numbers 88.61–66 in 1970.|$|R
50|$|Each train sets {{consists}} of four <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and four trailer cars, equipped with two driving units, {{and each of them}} {{is in charge of the}} driving of two <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and two trailer cars.|$|R
5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 fifty <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> {{bodies were}} ordered to allow some of the {{original}} 1904–05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 <b>motor</b> <b>car.</b> The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
50|$|The Q38 stock {{consisted}} of 25 driving <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 183 trailers. <b>Motor</b> <b>cars</b> were numbered in the District line 4xxx series whilst the trailer cars were numbered with the O and P stock trailers.|$|R
50|$|The train {{consisted}} of three <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and two trailer <b>cars.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were about twice as heavy as the trailer cars, and the trailers were significantly more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to never couple two trailer cars together, but to always have a single trailer between two <b>motor</b> <b>cars.</b> The heavier <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> provided stability for the lighter trailers. In the Malbone Street wreck train, two trailers were coupled together, and it was these two cars, in order numbers 80 and 100, that sustained {{the bulk of the}} damage, both to the cars and to the passengers.|$|R
5000|$|A further 4 two-car trains {{were built}} in 1894, these were only 40 ft long, {{followed}} by enough <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and trailers {{were built in}} 1896 to allow 15 two-car trains and 8 three-car trains to be formed. These newer <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were fitted with [...] motors. To meet competition from the electric tramways that offered a faster service, in 1902 the <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were fitted with two Dick, Kerr & Co. [...] motors, which reduced the travel time {{from end to end}} from 32 minutes to 20 minutes. At the same time, ten <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were widened to 9 ft to increase accommodation.|$|R
5|$|Michelena {{excelled in}} a singing role in The Tik-Tok Man of Oz in 1913. That year, during the autumn season, Michelena was a {{featured}} {{star of the}} Mechanics' Fair, an engineering and auto show in San Francisco. Following that, she sang at the inauguration of the Lincoln Highway, the nation's first transcontinental road. The western terminus celebration at the Valencia Theatre in San Francisco was organized by the <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Dealers' Association, October 31, 1913.|$|E
5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, {{as well as the}} more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>car,</b> snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
50|$|A full {{train was}} made up of two units running back-to-back, with the two <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> adjoining. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> had no seating {{accommodation}} or through-gangway, so the two halves of the train were unconnected for passengers.|$|R
50|$|The cars of JR Central sets I4 and I5 are {{numbered}} in the -3000 series. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> are each fitted with one WPS28A single-arm pantograph. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> in sets I1 and I3 each have two.|$|R
50|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} {{built by the}} Union Construction Company, eight were driving <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and the rest were trailers. The eight <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> {{numbered}} 700-714 (even numbers only), were initially owned by the London Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson <b>Motor</b> <b>Car</b> Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family <b>motor</b> <b>car</b> and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I <b>motor</b> <b>car.</b> Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
50|$|By the 1920s the District {{was having}} to rebuild its {{original}} wooden cars and having reliability {{problems with the}} bogies fitted to the <b>motor</b> and trailer <b>cars.</b> In 1921 {{it was decided to}} purchase new <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> taking the traction equipment from the current <b>motor</b> <b>cars,</b> converting these into trailers with new bogies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to apply TOPS to diesel {{multiple}} units saw each carriage within a unit being allocated its own unique class number. This was probably because most DMUs were not kept in permanent formations. Classes were allocated according to the following division: 100-131: Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>cars</b> 140-150: Driving Trailer cars 160-190: Trailer cars 201-203: DEMU Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>cars</b> 211-212: DEMU Driving Trailer cars 221-225: DEMU Trailer cars 251: Express DEMU Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>cars</b> 261: Express DEMU Trailer cars ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{order was}} made up of 192 <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> and 228 trailers. The <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> had wooden bodies on steel underframes and one motored bogie {{containing}} two GE69 traction motors each rated at [...] controlled with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) equipment. Both bogies carried shoegear, that were connected together by a power bus line. One hundred and twenty end <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> had one driving position, the reminder with two diving positions were intended for the centre of trains. Twenty end <b>motor</b> <b>cars</b> were built with luggage compartments but these were soon replaced with seating. The trailer cars were built entirely of wood, thirty two having driving positions. The trains were fitted with the Westinghouse air brake.|$|R
