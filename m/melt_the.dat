Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties.

The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route.

This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E

5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the <b>melt.</b> <b>The</b> melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further <b>melt</b> <b>the</b> remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E

5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not <b>melt</b> <b>the</b> base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to <b>melt</b> <b>the</b> filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to <b>melt</b> <b>the</b> plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E

30|$|Subsequently, {{the mesh}} {{structure}} {{undergoes a process}} of <b>the</b> consecutive <b>melting</b> {{of large numbers of}} individual nanowires. During <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> of <b>the</b> mesh as shown in Figure  5 a, the variation in Im and Vm of the mesh exhibits the repetition of three different trends: (I) both Im and Vm decrease, (II) both Im and Vm increase, and (III) Im decreases while Vm increases. The solid-line arrows in Figure  5 c,d indicate these three trends. Such repetition of zigzag pattern as shown in Figure  5 a can be explained in detail as below. After one mesh segment is <b>melted,</b> <b>the</b> electrical pathway in the mesh is changed so that the mesh resistance increases, and therefore Joule heating increases. In one case, the maximum temperature of the mesh may be far beyond <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point of <b>the</b> wire, which means the present current is much higher than that for <b>the</b> subsequent wire <b>melting.</b> To precisely obtain <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> current for <b>the</b> subsequent wire <b>melting</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> current when the maximum temperature of the mesh properly reaches <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point), <b>the</b> input current has to be decreased, which means <b>the</b> decrease of <b>melting</b> current. In another case, the maximum temperature of the mesh is still lower than <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point of <b>the</b> wire. To make further <b>melting,</b> <b>the</b> input current has to be increased to make the maximum temperature rise up to <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point, which implies <b>the</b> increase of <b>melting</b> current. <b>The</b> irregular alternation of these two cases leads to the zigzag pattern of the relationship between Im and Vm during <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> process of <b>the</b> mesh. Moreover, it is thought that if the pitch size of the mesh is smaller, the extent of zigzag pattern will be mitigated. In an extreme case, when the pitch size is zero which makes the mesh transit to thin film, the present zigzag pattern will be diminished and the relationship between Im and Vm will become smooth.|$|R
