50|$|In {{the early}} days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, {{companies}} used <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> switchboards, and switchboard operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.|$|R

40|$|In a 4 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> echo {{may arise}} both by {{electrical}} crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset. The echo loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss. In a digital 4 -wire connection, including 4 -wire subscriber lines and digital <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> the main echo paths are found in the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> itself: [...] - t [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Initially, the {{operating}} telephone companies {{wanted to have}} the caller ID function performed by the central office as a voice announcement and charged on a per-call basis. John Harris, an employee of Northern Telecom's <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> manufacturing division in London, Ontario promoted {{the idea of having}} caller ID as a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> display. The <b>telephone</b> was coded ECCS for Enhanced Custom Calling Services. A video of his prototype was used to leverage the feature from the central office to the <b>telephone</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R
50|$|In July 1881 {{the first}} {{telephone}} circuit in Istanbul was established between the Ministry of Post and Telegraph in Soğukçeşme and the Postahane-i Amire in Yenicami.

A mobile-telephone exhibit traces the changes in mobile phone technology from 1980s car phones to current cellular phones. Other exhibits allow visitors to learn about electricity, sound, and magnetism.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) was {{introduced}} in 1958 to allow a caller to call another telephone directly instead of via a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange operator. Uniform exchange codes, usually called STD codes, were allocated for every exchange in the country, progressively as STD was rolled out. This process was not completed until 1979.|$|R

50|$|Not all <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges were non-dialable points. Some were {{equipped}} with apparatus which displayed the called number to an operator when an outside call arrived from an automated dial exchange; this panel call indicator or coded-call indicator working {{would have made}} them dialable points from other exchanges, {{despite the absence of}} local dial.|$|R
5000|$|Strowger, an undertaker, was {{motivated}} to invent an automatic telephone exchange after having difficulties {{with the local}} telephone operators, {{one of whom was}} the wife of a competitor.

5000|$|The village {{post office}} {{is on the}} Basingstoke Road. It has been a post office since 1885, and was a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> {{exchange}} until 1934.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> for the 1A2 systems were modifications of the Bell System standard 500-series telephones for rotary dial systems, and the 2500-series Touch-Tone desk sets. For key system operation these sets were equipped {{with a set of}} push-buttons (keys) and additional internal contact springs to control the additional operational features, resulting in a large variety of specialty telephones. Specifically, such <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). <b>Telephone</b> <b>sets</b> could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R
50|$|LSI {{also allowed}} smaller systems to {{distribute}} the control (and features) into individual <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that don't require any single shared control unit. Generally, these systems are used with a relatively few <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.|$|R

50|$|A {{telephone}} switchboard is a telecommunications system {{used in the}} {{public switched telephone network}} or in enterprises to interconnect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between the subscribers or users, or between other exchanges. The switchboard was an essential component of a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange, and was operated by switchboard operators who used electrical cords or switches to establish the connections.|$|R
5000|$|The Kaitieke County stock yards {{are located}} at the {{junction}} of the Upper and Lower Retaruke Roads [...] There stands the World War I memorial, a set of stock yards for auctioning of sheep stock, and a defunct <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. Previously in near proximity of the stock yards there was a postal depot, a general store and then an automatic telephone exchange.|$|R
50|$|Wiring between system {{components}} and <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> was facilitated by Type 66 punch-down blocks.|$|R
50|$|Each {{connection}} to a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> required six wires from the key system: One pair (two wires) carried the talk circuit (tip and ring), one pair carried control information, known as A-Leads, for that line, designated A and A1, and the third pair carried current to a lamp for the specific line key position on the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> (L and LG).|$|R
