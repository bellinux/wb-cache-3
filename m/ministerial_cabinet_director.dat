Relatively large, <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> consist of political advisers who as “an extension of their minister” in a superior position in relation to senior civil service, constantly put pressure on the civil servants in order to ensure political responsiveness. These ministerial advisers are endowed with crucial policy-making roles and colonise all stages of the policy process. The present contribution makes use of the latest material on the policy analytical roles of ministerial advisers in Belgium, Greece and the European Commission, collected through surveys and elite interviews, in order to analyse <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> advisers’ policy making activity. Beyond the idiosyncrasies of every <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> system we observe that <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> advisers form mini shadow administrations whose personnel performs multiple roles, with an emphasis on policy management and co-ordination within and across the executive, combining expertise with political feasibility, and exercising political control over the administration. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|While in many Western-European {{countries}} the ascend of special advisers {{is a relatively}} recent phenomenon, Belgium since long engages <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> as structural interfaces between politics and administration. Relatively large by international standards, <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> consist of political advisers who as “an extension of their minister” {{put pressure on the}} civil servants in order to ensure political responsiveness. Ministerial advisers have crucial policy-making roles, while the career civil servants {{at the top of the}} administration were long considered to be marginalized in the policy-making process. At the turn of the millennium, the reduction and revision of <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> in favour of strengthening the administration’s role in policy formulation gained a place on the agenda. In several of the Belgian administrations, the policy analytical capacity has been strengthened, and the relations between the administration and <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> improved in the direction of greater complementary of roles. This chapter makes draws on comparative literature on politico-administrative relations, and of survey material on the policy analytical roles of ministerial advisers and civil servants to analyse how bureaucratic policy expertise is balanced with political control. The analysis points at the enduring functionality of <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> in a polity characterized by fragile coalition government and partitocracy. status: publishe...|$|R

Ministers each have their own staff, called a [...] "ministerial cabinet" [...] (<b>Cabinet</b> ministériel). Each <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> consists of around ten to twenty members, who are political appointees. Cabinet members assist the Minister in running a ministry.

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the first initial wave of {{collected}} dataScholarly attention on political advisers has grown steadily in recent years. Research has focused on advisers’ profiles, policy making roles, issues of accountability, as well as on their role as the third prominent party in the politics administration interface. While empirical research on national administrative systems, especially Westminster ones, has increased, we know less on those individual agents in <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> systems, and very little in supranational administrations, especially the EU. The aim of the proposed paper is to investigate the policy making roles of advisers in European Commissioners’ cabinets. Who are those actors and what do they do? Are they a case of agents active in a politicised policy advisory system, such as the ones found in <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> or is their involvement in the policy process more in line with the sui generis European Commission politico-administrative context? To answer those questions we put forward a comparative study design and a mixed data collection method, using both a survey questionnaire and interviews. The study shows that the EC cabinet system shares important similarities, but also differences with national <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> systems. EC cabinets work as ‘professional offices’ in a supranational politico-administrative setting that is significantly less politicised and conflictual than in national <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> systems. EC advisers appear to be politically aware experts, though not necessarily specialists, who indulge both in the technical, as well as the steering side of policy, while their policy advice activities have a strong horizontal, intra-executive, but also governance dimension. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{contribution}} {{is to examine the}} policy making role of Greek ministerial advisers. Given the lack of prior empirical work on the issue, the objective is to add the empirical examination of a new case in the literature. This is achieved by locating the Greek <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> adviser phenomenon within the <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> tradition, as well as putting forward a classification using typologies according to policy roles, policy advice activities based on the nature and dimension of advice, content of advice and finally the policy cycle. The contribution in hand was designed as a single country, small N, comparative study. Data was collected for the 2010 – 2013 period, using a mixed methods approach: a questionnaire survey on 28 advisers, semi-structured interviews with two Ministers and four senior civil servants, and document analysis. The argument put forward in the study is that Greek ministerial advisers form a case of agents active in a politicized advisory system, as found in <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets.</b> Based on the evidence in hand Greek ministerial advisers have been classified as coordinators, being predominantly generalists, with a main focus on management of the government program, providing “hot”, pure political and policy process advice, as well as short term crisis and fire-fighting advice. Greek ministerial advisers appear to be political without being overtly partisan. They are primarily managers focusing on policy steering rather than experts focusing on technical policy making. Moreover, they provide for vertical, within the Ministry’s departments, coordination, resorting to horizontal coordination mainly with advisers at other Ministries. Finally, they deal predominantly with the front end of policymaking, enjoying a high leverage in agenda setting and policy formulation. Greek ministerial advisers, though, are also highly active in the back end of the policy cycle in particular implementation and evaluation, reflecting both their project-management coordinator role, as well as the central role <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> exercise in policy making. status: publishe...|$|R

The history, statutory provisions, institutional habitat and policy making roles of Greek <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> advisers is presented. Second, {{and this is the}} main theoretical and empirical contribution of the chapter in hand, the chapter explores the minister / political adviser relationship in Greece by addressing the issue of trust. Beyond recent theoretical advances in the minister-adviser relationship, very little is known on the issue of trust, which is the real currency in that relationship. Trust buys influence with the minister. For this reason it begs for more scholarly attention. The chapter is driven by a set of questions. How can trust be defined in the <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet</b> context and what are its sources? Do minister-principals trust their adviser-agents the same or are there different circles of trust within cabinets; if so, which ones and why? In the end, how much currency does trust have in the policy making process? Is it always a source of influence and when does it backfire?status: accepte...|$|R
