40|$|One of {{the four}} steps within Council Regulation 793 / 93 /EEC on the {{evaluation}} and control of existing chemicals is the priority setting step. The priority setting step is concerned with selecting high-priority substances from {{a large number of}} substances, initially starting with 2, 474 high-production-volume chemicals. In {{order to be able to}} efficiently carry out the priority setting step, an automated priority setting method was developed, the so-called European Union risk ranking method (EURAM). The EURAM produces rankings among the high-production-volume chemicals appearing in the International Uniform Chemical Information Database (IUCLID). As part of a publication series, this paper deals with the data selection criteria used in EURAM and furthermore with data validation of the selected data. To validate the selected data in EURAM, comparisons are made with validated data of priority chemicals for which European Union risk assessment reports have been completed or with data of priority chemicals from the Screening Information Data Set initial assessment reports of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Regression analysis between the selected data in EURAM and the data selected by expert judgment in the assessment procedure resulted in good correlation for physicochemical properties and aquatic toxicity data. In addition, the type of biodegradation (i. e., readily biodegradable, inherently biodegradable, or nonbiodegradable) selected by EURAM also was in agreement with the type of biodegradation selected by expert judgment in the risk assessment procedure. Hence, the good correlation between the automated data selection procedure of EURAM and the data selection by expert judgment indicates that the data selection criteria of EURAM, which are developed in order to select data for priority purposes among high-production-volume chemicals in IUCLID, seem to perform well.

In this study, a number of banned tire treatment products were evaluated principally by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using solid phase microextraction (SPME) as a pre-concentration technique. The chemicals off-gassed by each product were determined and grouped into two broad categories: ‘plasticizer-based’ tire treatment products and ‘hydrocarbon-based’ tire treatment products. This information was then applied to the analysis of genuine tire samples provided by the United States Auto Club (USAC), a professional racing association. Over the course of one year, 10 out of the 71 questioned samples tested positive for a prohibited treatment product. The manufacturers' claims regarding their products' invisibility to lab tests were largely proven to be unfounded: both the products themselves and the tires treated with them can be identified by a number of characteristic volatile compounds. These included known plasticizers such as pentanedioic <b>acid</b> <b>diethyl</b> <b>ester,</b> plasticizer-related compounds such as 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, and dearomatized distillates...|$|R
40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} the ligand neocuproine (2, 9 -dimethylphenanthroline) allow a number of exchange equilibrium studies between the low valence complex [Pd(eta(2) -nq) (Neocup) ] (nq = naphthoquinone; Neocup = neocuproine) and several alkenes and alkynes. A new order of stability which compares differently unsaturated molecules was established. An overview of the factors governing the stability of palladium(0) alkene and alkyne derivatives {{as a function of}} the steric and electronic characteristics of both the unsaturated molecule and the ligand becomes accessible and a comparison with the previously determined order was therefore feasible. Such a comparison enlightens the importance of the substituent methyl groups in ortho position of the hetero-aromatic ring which represents the molecular fragment common to all the ligands considered. Taking advantage of the steric requirements of the alkene tmetc (tmetc = tetramethylethylenetetracarboxylate) a kinetic investigation of the reaction between the olefin itself and the complexes [Pd(eta(2) -dmfu) (L-L') ] (dmfu = dimethylfumarate; L-L' = 8 -diphenylphosphanyl- 2 -methyl-quinoline, neocuproine, phenanthroline) was carried out. The structures of the complexes [Pd(eta(2) -dmfu) (DPPQ) ] and [Pd(eta(2) -deta) (Neocup) ] (deta = but- 2 -ynedioc <b>acid</b> <b>diethyl</b> <b>ester)</b> were also reported in the present paper.

Methods: After the GZ-DE solution was administered via the intravenous, intraduodenal, intraileal, and stomach routes, GZ-DE and GZ concentrations in bile were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The stability of GZ-DE was estimated from residual GZ-DE and GZ produced in GZ-DE solutions prepared with distilled water, a pH 1. 2 solution, 0. 9 % NaCl solution, and phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7. 4) at 37 °C. Results: GZ-DE was eliminated into bile by the pharmacokinetic parameters of apparent distribution rate constant (4. 56 ± 0. 36 per hour) and apparent elimination rate constant (0. 245 ± 0. 042 per hour). After intravenous and intraduodenal administration of GZ-DE, the concentration ratio of GZ-DE to GZ in bile was approximately 4 : 1, and the bioavailability of GZ containing GZ-DE was three-fold higher compared with the bioavailability of GZ after intraduodenal administration. GZ-DE was immediately precipitated in pH 1. 2 solution and was converted to GZ by hydrolysis in pH 7. 4 solution. Conclusion: Improvement of intestinal absorption of GZ was made possible by administration of GZ-DE into the intestine where absorption of GZ is lower than in the strong acidic environment of the stomach. However, because the elimination rate in bile simulated from kinetic parameters of GZ-DE was higher than the conversion rate from GZ-DE to GZ by hydrolysis, it is thought that the availability of GZ as a revolutionary prodrug was not high from the viewpoint of bioavailability of GZ in the liver by intestinal administration of GZ-DE.

40|$|Alcoholism is {{a chronic}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by the}} appearance of a withdrawal syndrome following the abrupt cessation of alcohol intake that includes symptoms of physical and emotional disturbances, anxiety being the most prevalent symptom. In humans, it was shown that anxiety may increase the probability of relapse. In laboratory animals, however, the use of anxiety to predict alcohol preference has remained difficult. Excitatory amino acids as glutamate have been implicated in alcohol hangover and may be responsible for the seizures and anxiety observed during withdrawal. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) is a midbrain region critical for the modulation/expression of anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and the propagation of seizures induced by alcohol withdrawal, the glutamate neurotransmission being one of the most affected. The present study was designed to evaluate whether low- (LA) and high-anxiety rats (HA), tested during the alcohol hangover phase, in which anxiety is the most prevalent symptom, are more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of alcohol when tested in a voluntary alcohol drinking procedure. Additionally, we were interested in investigating the main effects of reducing the excitatory tonus of the dorsal midbrain, after the blockade of the ionotropic glutamate receptors into the DPAG, on the voluntary alcohol intake of HA and LA motivated rats that were made previously experienced with the free operant response of alcohol drinking. For this purpose, we used local infusions of the N-metil D-Aspartato (NMDA) and alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -kainate receptors antagonist DL- 2 -Amino- 7 -phosphonoheptanoic acid - DL-AP 7 (10 nmol/ 0. 2 mu l) and L-glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>diethyl</b> <b>ester</b> - GDEE (160 nmol/ 0. 2 mu l) respectively. Alcohol intoxication was produced by 10 daily bolus intraperitonial (IP) injections of alcohol (2. 0 g/kg). Peak-blood alcohol levels were determined by gas-chromatography analysis in order to assess blood-alcohol content. Unconditioned and conditioned anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the use of the fear-potentiated startle procedure (FPS). Data collected showed that anxiety and alcohol drinking in HA animals are positively correlated in animals that were made previously familiarized with the anxiolytic effects of alcohol. In addition, anxiety-like behavior induced during alcohol hangover seems to be an effect of changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission into DPAG possibly involving AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors, among others.

40|$|Neuropeptide S (NPS) is {{the last}} neuropeptide {{identified}} via Reverse Pharmacology techniques. NPS selectively binds and activates a previously orphan GPCR 154, now named NPSR, producing intracellular calcium mobilization and cAMP levels. Biological functions modulated by the NPS/NPSR system include anxiety, arousal, locomotion, food intake, memory, and drug addiction. The primary sequence of NPS (in humans SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS) is highly conserved among vertebrates especially at the N-terminus. Ala- and D-scan together with truncation studies demonstrated that the N-teminal sequence of the molecule is crucial for biological activity. Focused structure–activity investigations performed on Phe 2, Arg 3, and Asn 4 confirmed this indication and revealed the chemical requirements of these positions for NPSR binding and activation. The sequence Gly 5 -Val 6 -Gly 7 seems to be important for shaping the bioactive conformation of the peptide. Structure–activity studies on Gly 5 enabled identification {{of the first generation}} of peptidergic NPSR pure antagonists including [D-Cys(tBu) 5]NPS and [D-Val 5]NPS whose antagonist properties were confirmed in vivo. This PhD thesis is focused on the structure activity relationship study of NPS position 5. In particular, in order to identify new potent and selective antagonists of the NPSR receptor, we have designed, synthesized and inserted in position 5 of NPS the following non natural amino acids: i) the chimeric Valine/Leucine amino acid, Ipv, 2 -amino- 3, 3, 4 -trimethyl-pentanoic acid as racemate; ii) the R and S form of the amino acid, Ddb, 2, 4 -diamino- 3, 3 -dimethylbutyric acid characterized by a branched aliphatic side chain functionalized with a primary amino group; iii) some penicilammine S-alkylate analogs. This work has allowed to investigate and apply different chemical strategies for the synthesis of alpha-amino acids characterized by branched aliphatic side chains. In addition the original synthetic scheme adopted for the synthesis of 2 -amino- 3, 3, 4 -trimethyl-pentanoic acid in which the key step is the copper (I) chloride-catalyzed conjugated addition of i-propyl magnesium bromide to 2 - isopropylidene-malonic <b>acid</b> <b>diethyl</b> <b>ester</b> together with the commercial variety of Grignard reagents available make this route suitable for further synthetic applications, including the synthesis of novel non natural valine derivatives. The pharmacological data obtained further corroborate the proposal that chirality and steric hindrance of position 5 of NPS are crucial chemical requirements for modulating peptide efficacy and potency. It has been also found that NPSR antagonists can be generated by replacing NPS position 5 with Damino acids characterized by basic side chain. Finally, the use of S-alkyl penicilammine showed that the increase in steric hindrance of position 5 is better tolerated if generated by an aromatic substituent compared to aliphatic groups suggesting that planarity is a chemical feature useful for the identification of novel NPSR antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Fluorotelomer (FT) {{compounds}} {{are commonly}} used to produce commercial polymers for making surfaces stain-resistant in textile fabrics, carpets, furniture and paper as well as use in pesticide carriers, paints, heat-stable lubricants and fire-fighting foams and floor polishes. The FT polymers consist of a non-fluorinated backbone linked to FT compounds through ester, ether or urethane bonds. These linkages are subject to microbially mediated cleavage releasing volatile fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), which subsequently degrade to suite of acid metabolites of concern including the globally detected perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). ^ In my research, rates of aerobic biotransformation of 8 : 2 fluorotelomer stearate (FTS), 8 : 2 fluorotelomer citrate (TBC), toluene- 2, 4 -di(8 : 2 fluorotelomer urethane) (FTU) and hexamethylene- 1, 6 -di(8 : 2 fluorotelomer urethane) (HMU) were quantified in different soils, and analog-induced biotransformation was probed for FTU using a non-fluorinated urethane with the same backbone. At each sampling time, triplicate soil microcosms were extracted by sequential extraction and analyzed with LC/MS/MS or GC-MS/EI for FT monomers, FTOHs and acid metabolites. Relative rates of biotransformation followed: FTS 3 ̆e 3 ̆e 3 ̆e TBC 3 ̆e FTU and HMU. FTS half-lives ranged from 5 d to 28 d. Slower degradation of TBC, FTU, and HMU is likely due to enzyme access hindered by the additional FT chains. Biodegradation of urethane linkages also appeared slower compared to the ester linkages and a half-life was not reached within the 6 -month studies. PFOA was the dominant persistent acid metabolite produced in all studies and overall metabolite production was higher in the forest soil. Biotransformation of FTU in forest soil, where a non-fluorinated toluene- 2, 4 -dicarbamic <b>acid</b> <b>diethyl</b> <b>ester,</b> TDAEE was added, enhanced degradation of FTU was not observed; however, PFOA production was greatly enhanced with each addition. ^ Results of this research clearly show that FT monomers used as surfactants and in producing polymers can serve as an indirect source of persistent perfluorinated acids in the environment. The rates of cleavage were shown {{to be affected by}} the type of hydrocarbon backbone and the number of FT chains present. In addition, although these studies were not conducted long enough to see PFOA concentrations plateau, PFOA production was much less than observed in FTOH biotransformation studies. This mitigation is directly associated to the rate of cleavage, thus FTOH release rates, multiple competing metabolite pathways, increases in irreversible binding with increasing residence time, and microbial community diversity. Hence, overall PFOA production is likely to be much less from monomers, and therefore, even less from polymers. The data for these FT monomers will aid in estimating expected PFOA loads from such monomer residuals that may be present in FT polymers or formed by polymer breakdown as well as aiding in the prediction of FT polymer stability in soils. ...|$|R
