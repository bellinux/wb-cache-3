Study Design: A SWOT analysis was performed by use of triangulation data; this took place by integrating all relevant published documents on the origin and organization of the PCCs and the results from interviews with PCC experts and with PCC professionals (N= 91). Structured interviews were performed with PCC-professionals (health care professionals (N= 67) and PCC managers N= 12)) and PCC-experts (N= 12) in Amsterdam and qualitatively analysed thematically. The interview themes were based on a pre-set list of codes, derived from a prior documentation study and a focus group with PCC experts.  Results: Perceived advantages of PCCs were more continuity of care, shorter communication lines, low-threshold contact between professionals and promising future perspectives. Perceived challenges included the absence of uniform multidisciplinary guidelines, delays in communication with hospitals and midwives, inappropriate accommodation for effective professional integration, differing expectations regarding the PCC-manager role among PCC-partners and the danger of professionals' needs dominating clients' needs. Conclusions: Professionals perceive PCCs as a promising development in the integration of services. Remaining challenges involved improvements at the managerial and organizational level.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the social and economic consequences of maternity protection all over the world. Its proponents often state that <b>maternity</b> protection <b>helps</b> to improve the health of children and eliminate gender discrimination in the labor market.

50|$|Maternity leave is a {{temporary}} period of absence from employment granted to mothers immediately before or after childbirth. <b>Maternity</b> leave <b>helps</b> mothers return to their previous employer due to the increased legal protection. With maternity leave, mothers are now more likely {{to return to their}} previous employer due to the increased legal protection. The policy minimizes the negative externalities of motherhood by maintaining women's employment options following maternity leave. A negative aspect is that maternity leave can reduce the incentive for businesses to hire women. Opponents have also stated that maternity leave is harmful because it reinforces that care work is still women's work. Providing maternity leave and not paternity leave can reinforce normative roles of women as the primary care providers, which can perpetuate the motherhood penalty by strengthening and confirming employer biases. Maternity leave is a social policy that takes that current social norms and tries to work around them instead of changing them.|$|R

40|$|The essay explores government-backed {{attempts}} to improve maternal-infant health under Fascism in Italy. It argues that women's {{attempts to}} turn the fascist politization of motherhood to their own advantage {{can be viewed as}} a form of maternalism - one in which mothers expressed their needs through unorganized resistance and by wielding indirect influence on state welfare policies. The author arguees that the government's emphasis on pronatalism created opportunities for some women: it facilitated the emergence of female networks and led to the professionalization of occupations as nursing and social work, while also granting both working and non-working mothers a greater sense of entitlement to assistance. Nevertheless, Fascism's provisions on <b>maternity</b> and infancy <b>helped</b> pave the way for a more modern social welfare system and laid the groundwork for "postwar opportunities and scenarios for a new kind of female citizenship"...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} the effects of poor local access to obstetric care on the risks of having a neonate diagnosed as non-normal, a long hospital stay, and/or high hospital charges. METHODS: Washington State birth certificates linked with hospital discharge abstracts of mothers and neonates were used to study 29809 births to residents of rural areas. Births to women from rural areas where more than {{two thirds of the}} women left for care were compared with births to women from rural areas where fewer than one third left for care. RESULTS: Poor local access to providers of obstetric care was associated with a significantly greater risk of having a non-normal neonate for both Medicaid and privately insured patients. However, poor local access to care was consistently associated with higher charges and increased hospital length of stay only if the patient was privately insured. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that local <b>maternity</b> services may <b>help</b> prevent non-normal births to rural women and, among privately insured women, might decrease use of neonatal resources...|$|R

40|$|Maternal {{health care}} {{utilization}} in Ethiopia {{is very low}} which is reflected in high maternal mortality. Ethiopian men {{are known to have}} a strong influence on partner´s health care seeking behavior but how men´s socio-demographic background is associated with service use is largely unclear. Involving men in promoting partner´s reproductive health is considered as an effective means in patriarchal societies and it can be combined with enhancing women´s status. Tracking the characteristics that are connected to utilization of <b>maternity</b> services <b>helps</b> to target the interventions correctly. This study aims to reveal how male partners´ socio-demographic background is associated with women´s maternal health care seeking behavior, measured by antenatal and delivery care utilization, as well as with their own participation in antenatal check-ups, andto find out the possible differences in the background characteristics that shape the use of delivery care in urban and rural areas. To this end, 4   206 Ethiopian men aged 15 - 59 years were studied using the data fromEthiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2011. Descriptive analyses, univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were conducted,the latter enabling to control for confounding of the explanatory variables (age, marital status, number of children, educational level, occupation, wealth, religion, ethnicity, type of place of residence and vehicle in the household). According to men, 57 % of their partners had had at least one antenatal visit and 12 % had delivered in an institute. Among men whose partners used antenatal care, 43 % participated in antenatal visits. Low number of children, higher educational level, better wealth and urban type of residence were associated with more frequent service utilization. In addition, occupation and ethnicity turned out to be independent predictors. Partly different factors seemed to contribute to partner´s institutional delivery in urban and rural areas. Men´s socio-demographic characteristics are strongly connected to maternal health care utilization in Ethiopia. Raising men´s awareness is essential. Men should be integrated into reproductive health programs and targeted in all sectors when planning solutions to this life-threatening problem...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a psychometric scale – the birth {{satisfaction}} scale (BSS) – for assessing women’s birth perceptions. Design/methodology/approach – Literature review and transcribed research-based perceived birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction expression statements were converted into a scored questionnaire. Findings – Three overarching themes were identified: service provision (home assessment, birth environment, support, relationships with health care professionals); personal attributes (ability to cope during labour, feeling in control, childbirth preparation, relationship with baby); and stress experienced during labour (distress, obstetric injuries, receiving sufficient medical care, obstetric intervention, pain, long labour and baby’s health). Research limitations/implications – Women construct their birth experience differently. Views are directed by personal beliefs, reactions, emotions and reflections, which alter in relation to mood, humour, disposition, frame of mind and company kept. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals can use BSS to assess women’s birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Scores measure their service quality experiences. Social implications – Scores provide a global measure of care that women perceived they received during labour. Originality/value – Finding out more about what causes birth satisfaction and dissatisfaction <b>helps</b> <b>maternity</b> care professionals improve intra-natal care standards and allocate resources effectively.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decade or so, {{recommendations}} for improvements in maternity care have emphasised the importance of providing woman-centred care. Feedback from women about existing <b>maternity</b> services can <b>help</b> to identify whether services are currently meeting women’s needs. The present study aims to capture women’s expectations of, and experiences with maternity care, and to explore whether maternal and birth characteristics are associated with those experiences. Methods: A survey will be undertaken with a sample of approximately 2, 000 women who have given birth over a 3 -month period at seven public maternity units in two neighbouring health districts in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The survey will be mailed out three-four months after birth. The study will also examine two strategies intended to increase survey response rates: use of two types of pre-notification letters, and request for consent from women to link survey responses with health information recorded at the time of birth. Data analysis will examine response rate, evidence of sample bias and effect of pre-notification letters; describe expectations and experiences with maternity care and associations with maternal and/or health characteristics; and where possible, compare results with maternity satisfaction data reported by others. Discussion: This study will provide, {{for the first time in}} NSW, comprehensive information about women’s expectations, experiences and satisfaction with maternity services in two local health districts. It will identify aspects of care that are meeting women’s needs, and areas where care and service provision may be improved in line with the aspirations of Towards Normal Birth.

40|$|This report compares father {{involvement}} {{with their children}} in Bulgaria and the Netherlands by examining country differences in family formation patterns, policy context, and cultural prescriptions regarding family life. In studying the time fathers spend with their children, {{it is important to}} distinguish between time-structuring and time-flexible tasks because these tasks tend to be divided along gendered lines. Time-structuring tasks are those tasks that take a longer time to complete or have to be performed at a certain time of the day, such as bathing or feeding the child, and often fall to mothers to perform. Time-flexible tasks, on the other hand, are commonly performed by fathers. These are the tasks that can be performed at any time of the day and include reading to and playing with the child. Major conclusions are as follows:  With regard to family formation patterns, the two-child family model is persistent in both Bulgaria and the Netherlands, despite the Netherlands being farther along the individualisation process than Bulgaria.  The policy context in Bulgaria can be characterised by continuity with the country’s socialist past. Maternity, paternity, and parental leave remain long by international standards, and both mothers and fathers are expected to participate full-time in the labour market. Policy recommendations include: - Fathers in Bulgaria may benefit from more flexible work arrangements that allow them to combine work and childcare, - whilst mothers may benefit from shorter <b>maternity</b> leave which <b>helps</b> prevent discrimination on the labour market. - High quality childcare services for all children would benefit both mothers and fathers - as would policy supporting grandparental care...|$|R
40|$|This Report is {{the result}} of the {{deliberations}} of the Working Group on the Review and Improvement of Maternity Protection Legislation, and it makes key recommendations which will significantly improve maternity protection in this country. The speed with which this Government has already begun to implement the recommendations is clear evidence of its commitment to promoting the equal opportunities agenda. The Government has decided to make relevant changes to adoptive leave legislation in line with the recommendations in this Report. The increased periods of leave and other improvements recommended by the Group are also evidence of the growing awareness of the need for a greater balance between work and family responsibilities. Implementation of the Recommendations of the Working Group will make the workplace a better place to be for pregnant women and new mothers. The shortage of childcare places for babies is well-known, and improvements in <b>maternity</b> leave will <b>help</b> towards easing the childcare situation in respect of this category of children. The achievement of the Working Group in reviewing maternity protection legislation is commendable. There have been significant changes in the labour market and the workplace since the Maternity Protection Act came into operation in 1994 and the Report makes a valuable contribution in discussing the issues that have arisen in relation to the operation of a complex body of legislation over this period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} number of young women veterans are returning from war and military service and are seeking reproductive health care from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Many of these women seek maternity benefits from the VHA, and yet little is known regarding {{the number of women}} veterans utilizing VHA maternity benefits nor the characteristics of pregnant veterans using these benefits. In May 2010, VHA maternity benefits were expanded to include 7 days of infant care, which may serve to entice more women to use VHA maternity benefits. Understanding the changing trends in women veterans seeking <b>maternity</b> benefits will <b>help</b> the VHA {{to improve the quality of}} reproductive care over time. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the trends in delivery claims among women veterans receiving VHA maternity benefits over a 5 -year period and the characteristics of pregnant veterans utilizing VHA benefits. DESIGN: We undertook a retrospective, national cohort study of pregnant veterans enrolled in VHA care with inpatient deliveries between fiscal years (FY) 2008 and 2012. PARTICIPANTS: We included pregnant veterans using VHA maternity benefits for delivery. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included annualized numbers and rates of inpatient deliveries and delivery-related costs, as well as cesarean section rates as a quality indicator. KEY RESULTS: During the 5 -year study period, there was a significant increase in the number of deliveries to women veterans using VHA maternity benefits. The overall delivery rate increased by 44 % over the study period from 12. 4 to 17. 8 deliveries per 1, 000 women veterans. A majority of women using VHA maternity benefits were age 30 or older and had a service-connected disability. From FY 2008 to 2012, the VHA paid more than $ 46 million in delivery claims to community providers for deliveries to women veterans ($ 4, 993 /veteran). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 5 -year period, the volume of women veterans using VHA maternity benefits increased by 44 %. Given this sizeable increase, the VHA must increase its capacity to care for pregnant veterans and ensure care coordination systems are in place to address the needs of pregnant veterans with service-connected disabilities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antiretroviral {{therapy has}} created new {{expectations}} in {{the possibilities of}} procreation for persons living with HIV. Our objectives were to evaluate reproductive desire and to analyze the associated sociodemographic and clinical factors in HIV-infected women in the Spanish AIDS Research Network Cohort (CoRIS). Methods: A mixed qualitative-quantitative approach was designed. Women of reproductive age (18 - 45) included in CoRIS were interviewed by phone, and data were collected between November 2010 and June 2012 using a specifically designed questionnaire. Reproductive desire was defined as having {{a desire to be}} pregnant at present or having unprotected sex with the purpose of having children or wanting to have children in the near future. Results: Overall, 134 women were interviewed. Median age was 36 years (IQR 31 - 41), 55 % were Spanish, and 35 % were unemployed. 84 % had been infected with HIV through unprotected sex, with a median time since diagnosis of 4. 5 years (IQR 2. 9 - 6. 9). Reproductive desire was found in 49 % of women and was associated with: 1) Age (women under 30 had higher reproductive desire than those aged 30 - 39; OR = 4. 5, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 14. 3); 2) having no children vs. already having children (OR = 3. 2; 1. 3 - 7. 7 3); Being an immigrant (OR = 2. 2; 1. 0 - 5. 0); and 4) Not receiving antiretroviral treatment (OR = 3. 6; 1. 1 - 12. 1). The main reasons for wanting children were related to liking children and wanting to form a family. Reasons for not having children were HIV infection, older age and having children already. Half of the women had sought or received information about how to have a safe pregnancy, 87 % had disclosed their serostatus to their family circle, and 39 % reported having experienced discrimination due to HIV infection. Conclusions: The HIV-infected women interviewed in CoRIS have a high desire for children, and the factors associated with this desire are not fundamentally different from those of women in the general population. <b>Maternity</b> may even <b>help</b> them face a situation they still consider stigmatized and prefer not to disclose. Health-care protocols for handling HIV-positive women should incorporate specific interventions on sexual and reproductive health to help them fulfill their procreation desire and experience safe pregnanciesThe RIS cohort (CoRIS) is funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III through the Red Temática de Investigación Cooperativa en Sida (RIS C 03 / 173...|$|R
