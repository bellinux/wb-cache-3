40|$|In this study, commercially {{produced}} malts {{were used}} for small-scale simulated mashing trials to investigate the impact of differences in the level and thermostability of malt diastatic power (DP) enzymes on the resultant wort fermentability. A modified European Brewery Convention/American Society Brewing Chemists mashing protocol was used with mash-in temperatures ranging between 45 and 76 °C for full-malt and 30 % rice adjunct mashes. Malt extract yield varied little with <b>mashing</b> <b>temperature</b> for most varieties in this temperature range. However, the fermentability, maltose content, and free amino nitrogen of that extract was considerably affected by <b>mashing</b> <b>temperature</b> with 65 °C achieving the highest fermentability for all malt varieties. Multilinear regression analysis of full-malt and rice adjunct mashing trials at 65 °C using 43 commercial malts showed {{that the level of}} alpha-amylase and total limit dextrinase activity, Kolbach Index, and the total beta-amylase activity level and thermostability were the most important malt quality predictors of wort fermentability. These conclusions suggest that the conventional DP assessment could be replaced with the measurement of its component enzymes outlined above so that maltsters could better satisfy brewers malt quality expectations by blending and defining their malt quality in terms of these fermentability predicting factors. This information would be particularly useful to brewers who brew with multiple varieties and blends from different suppliers. The focus on individual enzyme characteristics by barley breeders is likely to provide selection targets that are more accurate and achievable...|$|E
40|$|The Brewing Industry {{is facing}} {{increasingly}} challenging times {{due to global}} competitive business environment and rising costs of raw materials. These factors consequently affect {{the economy of the}} industry. An effective solution to stay competitive is to enhance brewing process efficiency by optimisation of process units. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate optimal operating conditions that can be implemented in the brewing industry using the Micro- Brewery Plant at the University of the Witwatersrand. It was discovered that the longer the mashing route, the higher the yield of fermentable sugars. The mash regime and liquor to malt ratios were optimised and the carbohydrates obtained were analysed at 3. 5 L of water per kg of malt and a total mash time of 105 min. Carbohydrate and phenolic acid analyses were performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a UV-vis detector. The three different malts used had a phenolic acid content of 33. 25 μg/mL, 25. 44 μg/mL and 19. 98 μg/mL for malt A, B and C, respectively. The plot of 1 /T versus Ln(t) gave a negative slope with activation energy (Ea) = 209 KJ/mol, rate constant (k) = 4. 6 x 10 - 4 mg/L min, which are comparable to similar data reported in the literature. The kinetics studies showed that the optimised <b>mashing</b> <b>temperature</b> of 900 C was adequate to form 4 -Vinylguaiacol by thermal decarboxylation from the hydroxycinnamic acids. This study has shown that there is no direct correlation between phenolic acids and oxidative flavour stability of beer while the corresponding volatile phenols may affect beer flavour. The study showed that fermentation rates increase with temperature. Investigated pitching rates showed iv insignificant effect on fermentation rates. The study showed that added finings during boiling improve beer clarity and have an insignificant effect on fermentation rates. Analysis of commissioning strategies at Wits micro-brewery plant showed that verbal instruction is always open to error, while the written instruction or report is generally not open to error. Hence the commissioning documents have been developed in the study, which has helped in reduction of errors during brewing. It is therefore concluded that good record keeping and documentation is of essential need for successful commissioning of a brewery...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTBanana fig from fully ripe banana, caramel and malt extract, food drink {{thickening}} agent, {{acetic acid}} and local hop extract (Alfalfa) {{were used in}} the formulation of a low-sugar malt drink. Banana fig was used as a replacement for malted barley. The pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), percentage sugar content, specific gravity and saccharification of the extracts were determined. The effects of optimization of the mashing process using industrial enzyme-amyloglucosidase were also evaluated. The pH and percentage sugar content of the banana fig extract decreased with increased <b>mashed</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Specific gravity of the banana fig extracts decreased with increased <b>mashed</b> <b>temperatures,</b> with values from 1. 013 to 1. 010 against <b>mashed</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 45 °C and 80 °C respectively. At temperatures of 70 °C and above the saccharification was observed to be incomplete. However, the introduction of industrial enzyme-amyloglucosidase resulted in complete saccharification. The formulation of the malt flavoured low-sugar drink gave three samples of 6. 2 %, 7. 4 % and 11. 8 % sugar contents. Sensory evaluation carried out on the malt flavoured low-sugar drink with commercial Amstel malt drink showed no significant difference in taste and flavour for all the samples compared with reference sample at p> 0. 05. But sample BS 3 with 11. 8 % sugar content was significantly different (p< 0. 05) from sample BS 2 (7. 4 % sugar) and BS 1 (6. 2 % sugar) in colour and general acceptability. All samples except BS 1 with 6. 2 % sugar were accepted by the panellists. This malt flavoured low-sugar drink could thus help reduce health complications in conditions associated with high sugar consumption.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of barley starch plays a fundamental {{role in the}} final quality of fermented beverages in the brewing industry. The process of mashing involves steeping milled barley in water to stimulate the enzymatic {{decomposition of}} starch into simple carbohydrates.

40|$|A key {{biochemical}} process in brewing is the hydrolysis of starch by diastatic power (DP) enzymes into fermentable sugars during the mashing stage of brewing. Efficient starch hydrolysis during mashing requires initially starch gelatinization at approximately 59 - 64 degrees C and then sufficient DP enzyme activity to achieve starch hydrolysis. This investigation compared {{the persistence of}} DP enzyme activity during modified Institute of Brewing (MIoB, 1 : 3 grist/water ratio + Ca 2 +) mash with the conventional Congress (1 : 4 grist/water ratio) small-scale mash, using malt from three current Australian barley varieties. Traditionally, with the thermostability of DP enzymes, it is understood that beta-amylase is relatively thermostable, whereas beta-amylase and limit dextrinase (LD) are relatively thermolabile at conventional <b>mashing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In addition, it is also known that beta-amylase and in particular LD have bound and latent fractions that require release from binding proteins or inhibitors, respectively, before {{they are able to}} contribute to starch hydrolysis. One mechanism observed empirically was that heat applied during <b>mashing</b> at <b>temperatures</b> of approximately 55 - 60 degrees C appears to liberate bound beta-amylase and LD. The results in terms of DP enzyme release, thermostability, and activity were examined to understand the relative contributions of the three key DP enzymes to starch hydrolysis during different mashing conditions. Interestingly, we observed that both beta-amylase and LD retained significant levels of activity (approximately 40 % total activity), even after mashing for 60 min at 65 degrees C. These observations are of critical importance to brewers in meeting beer quality specifications when they manipulate <b>mash</b> <b>temperatures</b> to cope with variations in malt quality, developing new products, or producing beers requiring different wort qualities for production.

40|$|Diastatic power (DP), {{a measure}} of the level of {{activity}} of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, is a term that refers to the combined activity levels of beta-amylase, alpha-amylase, limit dextrinase, and alpha-glucosidase. The result of the action of these enzymes during brewing is to break down starch into component sugars that are readily fermented into alcohol by yeast. Although DP is a reasonable predictor of fermentability, it does not always accurately estimate the level of fermentable sugars generated during mashing or the subsequent fermentability of the resultant wort. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} allelic variation in beta-amylase thermostability has a significant impact on wort fermentability.

40|$|Research {{was carried}} out to {{determine}} the effect of high <b>temperature</b> <b>mashing,</b> use of short time germinated malt and low gravity fermentation on the quality of sorghum beer. The objective was to produce an acceptable low alcohol opaque beer. <b>Mashing</b> at high <b>temperatures</b> of 65 - 80 °C resulted in lower generation of fermentable sugars with the least being obtained at 80 °C leading to production of low alcohol. The main reason being that although beta- and alpha- amylase enzymes are inactivated at high temperatures beta-amylase is less temperature resistant than alpha-amylase. Thus the reduction in beta-amylase activity leads to reduction in the amount of fermentable sugar in the wort. The best low alcohol product was produced at 75 °C. At 80 °C although low alcohol was achieved than at 75 °C there was the problem of poor body of the beer. On the other hand malt germinated for shorter period of time produced beers almost as good as those of the control brew. Only malt germinated for one day gave alcohol slightly lower than control. This shows that malt irrespective of having been germinated for 1, 2 or 3 days can produce an excellent product as long as the germination reached required levels during malting process so as to have a malt with sufficient diastatic power. Low gravity fermentation revealed that very low alcohol could be achieved by this method but dilution of wort meant also dilution of other beer characteristics resulting in a product which was watery and had no flavour. The major effect of diluting wort was that the content of fermentable sugars was reduced proportionally. However, the product of a 30 % dilution was still acceptable since although alcohol was low, texture and flavour of the product were still reasonable. Thus mashing at 75 °C, use of malt germinated for one day and method of 30 % dilution can be recommended for the production of low alcohol opaque beers.

40|$|Free amino {{nitrogen}} (FAN) levels in sorghum grain brewing are characteristically low {{as a direct}} consequence of the very low levels of FAN in unmalted sorghum grain. During fermentation, FAN provides nutritional support to the yeast, enabling optimal yeast growth and efficient fermentation. Exogenous proteolytic enzymes are required to hydrolyse sorghum grain protein into FAN. Eight commercial proteolytic enzymes were studied in terms of their efficacy to produce FAN levels during mashing considered adequate (150 mg/L) to support optimal yeast functionality and their effect on extract levels. FAN as determined by the ninhydrin assay, ranged between 25 - 72 mg/ 100 g sorghum grist (representing 0 %- 185 % increase) when mashing was carried out at 55 °C over 45 mins with the 8 different enzymes. The proteolytic enzymes varied greatly in terms of their efficacy, possibly as a result of having different optimal operating conditions. It is also suggested that the proteolytic enzymes differed in terms of their classification and exopeptidase/endopeptidase ratio. In an attempt to further increase FAN levels, the effects of the reducing agent potassium metabisulphite (KMS) and different <b>mashing</b> <b>temperatures</b> (50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C) were also studied. Three enzymes (Flavourzyme, Neutrase, Papain) were selected for this part of the study. The addition of KMS caused {{a significant increase in the}} FAN in mashing systems that utilized Flavourzyme (22 % when mashing at 55 °C) and Neutrase (14 % when mashing at 55 °C), but not with Papain. It is suggested that KMS reduced the stabilizing disulphide bonds present in the sorghum kafirin, thus making the kafirin more digestible. The KMS could have reduced the effectiveness of Papain because it is a sulphydryl protease which possesses stabilizing disulphide bonds which were reduced by the KMS. Flavourzyme and Papain were more active at 55 °C, while Neutrase displayed maximum activity at 50 °C. The effect of mashing at a low temperature (40 °C) over an extended time period (7 hr) on FAN was studied using Flavourzyme. Samples treated with Flavourzyme and KMS showed a five-fold increase in FAN, while those treated with Flavourzyme only showed a four-fold increase. It is proposed that the low temperature was able to suppress the rate at which disulphide bonds were formed in kafirin, therefore improving its digestibility. The lower temperature also retarded the enzyme denaturation rate, while the long time period allowed the enzyme more contact time with the substrate. Microstructure analysis of sorghum protein bodies using transmission electron microscopy and of sorghum endosperm using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the relative indigestibility of kafirin makes a significant contribution to the relatively low FAN levels. Although the action of the proteolytic enzyme and KMS on the sorghum endosperm protein matrix showed notable degradation, large fragments of undigested protein bodies were observed. This once again suggested that disulphide bond cross-linking played a major role in reducing the digestibility of sorghum protein. The addition of Flavourzyme to a complete mashing cycle was also found to result in a significant increase (9 %) in extract. The ncrease in extract is attributed to the increased availability of starch to amylase hydrolysis as a result of the degradation of the protein matrix which envelopes the starch granules. The addition of KMS to the sorghum grain mashing system and the utilisation of a low temperature protein rest are effective methods of improving FAN in sorghum grain brewing.

5000|$|Mashing {{usually takes}} 1 to 2 hours, and {{during this time}} the various {{temperature}} rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and {{the intention of the}} brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to dextrins and then to fermentable sugars such as maltose. A mash rest from 49 - 55 C activates various proteases, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as corn and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at [...] activates β-glucanase, which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a <b>mash</b> rest <b>temperature</b> of 65 - 71 C is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest {{at the lower end of}} the range favours β-amylase enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like maltotriose, maltose, and glucose which are more fermentable by the yeast. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours α-amylase enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and dextrins which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result.

Arabinoxylan and beta-glucan hydrolyzing enzyme activities were determined during <b>mashing</b> using two <b>temperature</b> profiles. The measured enzymic activities increased for the BM 100 and BM 60 W 40 mashes {{in the early}} stages of mashing. The endoxylanase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activities remained constant at 50 degrees C but rapidly decreased above 50 degrees C. At 72 degrees C, the endoxylanase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activities were almost completely lost. The beta-D-xylosidase activity only decreased slowly at 63 degrees C. The beta-glucanase activity decreased rapidly at 50 degrees C and was completely lost after 15 min at 50 degrees C. From the xylose (Xyl) levels (a measure for arabinoxylan content) in the BM 100 worts (1. 28 - 1. 33 g/L), a solubilization of 0. 23 - 0. 26 % Xyl (% of cereal dry matter) during mashing was calculated. The Xyl levels in the BM 60 W 40 worts (0. 92 - 1. 11 g/L) corresponded with a solubilization of 0. 12 to 0. 15 % Xyl during mashing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The avocado {{presents}} {{a challenge in}} terms of industrialization, due to its high content of polyphenols and fats which are susceptible to oxidation processes. It contains enzymes that can cause various pulp deteriorations during agroindustrial processing, hence the need to add food preservatives in the traditional process. The flash vacuum-expansion (FVE) process is usually used in the vinification {{to break down the}} tissues and free some compounds. This investigation conducted an FVE process kinetic study for avocado industrialization purposes, and evaluated its effect on lipoxygenase, antioxidant capacity, phenolic content and food quality properties of the <b>mash.</b> The couple <b>temperature</b> and time conditions attained during the kinetic study reduced the lipoxygenase activity by up to 70 %, and the antioxidant capacity of the mashs obtained by FVE remained stable for 15 days without adding preservatives. The proportions in the food composition of the mash were consistent with those reported in the literature. Practical Applications: The results of our research suggest that the process of flash vaccum-expansion, promotes extraction of bioactive compounds present in plant tissues that in traditional processes are considered as waste. The flash vaccum-expansion process can be implemented for extracting pigments or to generate the disintegration of plant tissues or extractive fermentation pretreatments. So the products obtained in the process can serve as a basis for other processes or as a basis for various products. As shown in the results of our research, flash vaccum-expansion process also allows the reduction of enzyme activity in plant products which increases the stability of the finished product, this consequently improves the nutritional quality, it promotes the availability of beneficial compounds and reduces oxidation processes.

40|$|Laboratory mashing {{experiments}} {{were used to}} investigate and optimise protocols for mashing with unmalted sorghum using a novel low-temperature (Tmax = 78 °C) enzyme blend and mash schedule. Results are compared with equivalent data for a traditional high-temperature mash schedule (Tmax = 95 °C). An experimental design approach was used to model wort quality (Extract, FAN content, filtration rate, fermentable sugars contents, colour and turbidity) produced by each mash schedule across a full factorial design space. The factors varied were 1. Mash-in pH (5. 5 ± 0. 25) 2. Calcium chloride addition (2 g/kg ± 1) 3. Potassium metabisulphite (KMS) addition (1 g/kg ± 1) and 4. The amount of enzyme blend added to each system (recommended dosage ± 50 %). Wort quality was particularly sensitive to mash-in pH with best results achieved close to pH 5. 5 (hence selected as the design centre point). At pH values below 5. 5 wort extract decreased with either schedule, whereas the impacts of elevated pH at mash-in were slightly higher wort FAN levels, but increased wort turbidity and colour and reduced filterability of the laboratory wort. The novel low <b>temperature</b> <b>mash</b> schedule was able to produce wort of comparable quality with that from the high-temperature schedule. Design space models for the high- and low-temperature mash systems were used to suggest optimal conditions for each varied factor, {{with the objective of}} maximising wort extract and FAN, whilst minimising enzyme addition rates (hence cost). Optimised extracts of 10. 6 and 10. 8 °P were achieved for the low and high-temperature mash systems, with FAN levels of 60 and 57. 2 mg/L respectively. Optimal conditions required a mash-in pH of 5. 75 and around 2 g/kg KMS in each case. The high-temperature system required around 3 g/kg CaCl 2 addition for optimal performance whereas the low-temperature mash performed well with just 1 g/kg added CaCl 2. Use of the novel low-temperature mash schedule should facilitate substantial energy savings in the brewery, because it operates at lower maximum temperatures for a shorter overall process time and also because the mash schedule features only increases in process temperatures with time. This saves on the energy required to cool the mash in the traditional process from 95 °C (for starch gelatinisation) to the saccharification enzyme stand (60 °C) ...|$|R
