40|$|Growing {{concerns}} {{on energy}} consumption increase the demand of lightweight vehicles. One {{of the most}} efficient solutions is to use multi-material structure. As a solid state process, friction stir welding (FSW) is promising for joining dissimilar materials. However, the processing window for achieving successful dissimilar joints is still narrow. Besides, a large axial welding force is required when steel is involved. In order to address these challenges, a material softening phenomenon, electro-plastic effect (EPE) is proposed to {{be incorporated into the}} process. In this research, first, EPE on various materials is systematically reviewed and a hypothesis is proposed for understanding the softening mechanisms. The effectiveness of EPE is then evaluated on one type of advanced high strength steel, TRIP 780 / 800 steel. Second, traditional FSW process is experimentally studied for joining dissimilar Al 6061 to TRIP steel. Effects of process parameters on joint microstructure evolution are analyzed based on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>welding</b> force and temperature measured during the process. Intermetallic compound (IMC) layer of FeAl or Fe 3 Al with thickness of less than 1 μm is formed at the Al–Fe interface in the advancing side. The maximum ultimate tensile strength can reach 85 % of the base aluminum alloy. Third, analytical and numerical models are developed for friction stir welding of dissimilar materials. For plunge stage modeling, the field variable is introduced to identify regions of steel and aluminum and define the generalized material properties. Conservation equations are separately developed at the two materials interface for the discontinuities. The stable welding stage is modeled based on Eulerian formulation using multiple phase flow theories. The developed model can capture the material and temperature distribution measured from experiments. Finally, high density electrical currents are applied to the FSW process. Plunge stage of FSW is studied on aluminum alloy Al 6061 and TRIP 780 steel respectively. Effective reduction of the axial welding force can be obtained with good repeatability. During the FSW of Al 6061 to TRIP steel, the axial welding force can be consistently reduced under various welding conditions, which is a synergic result of both electro-plastic effect and Joule heating...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} small tool pin {{profiles}} on the microstructures and mechanical properties of 6061 aluminum alloy joints using {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) technique was investigated. Three different tool pin profiles: threaded tapered cylindrical (T 1), triangular (T 2) and square (T 3) were used to produce the joints. The {{results indicate that the}} weld joints are notably affected by joining with different tool pin profiles.

The fracture surface examination shows that the joints are also affected when welding with different types of tool pin profiles.

50|$|Relative {{to other}} methods of analysis, powder {{diffraction}} allows for rapid, non-destructive analysis of multi-component mixtures {{without the need}} for extensive sample preparation. This gives laboratories around the world the ability to quickly analyze unknown materials and perform materials characterization in such fields as metallurgy, mineralogy, forensic science, archeology, condensed matter physics, and the biological and pharmaceutical sciences. Identification is performed by comparison of the diffraction pattern to a known standard or to a database such as the International Centre for Diffraction Data's Powder Diffraction File (PDF) or the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Advances in hardware and software, particularly improved optics and fast detectors, have dramatically improved the analytical capability of the technique, especially relative to the speed of the analysis. The fundamental physics upon which the technique is based provides high precision and accuracy in the measurement of interplanar spacings, sometimes to fractions of an Ångström, resulting in authoritative identification frequently used in patents, criminal cases and other areas of law enforcement.
