25|$|The {{fuselage}} of 328 {{allows for}} a comfortable three-abreast airline-style seating arrangement {{to be used as}} well as a dense four-abreast configuration to accommodate greater passenger numbers, of which it is able to carry a maximum of 27. There are a total of six cabin configurations available for passenger and cargo operations, these include a flexible combi aircraft layout with a <b>movable</b> <b>wall</b> separating passengers and cargo, and a medical evacuation arrangement equipped with bio-floors and positions for four litters and medical attendees. The 328 is pressurized, a first for Dornier-built aircraft, which was implemented to achieve a higher level of passenger comfort; the passenger cabin is designed to be more akin to those of much larger passenger aircraft. A full-sized galley, toilet and washbasin can also be installed.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{is considered a}} fine example of traditional Quaker architecture because it contains all of the elements found in the typical meeting house. However, the building does have one major difference on its interior when compared with most meeting houses. Traditionally, Quaker meeting houses had two rooms, divided by a movable partition, termed [...] "shutters," [...] meant to separate men from women during meetings; these shutters are noticeably absent on the Benjaminville Meeting House. The members of the meeting at the Benjaminville Meeting House were among [...] "pioneers" [...] within the Society of Friends in that they were one of the first seven groups to allow men and women to meet as one group of Friends. The room inside the Benjaminville building was simply divided with a waist-high partition as opposed to the <b>movable</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Super Dave {{took place}} in a theater with an audience. The stage {{featured}} his signature [...] "bulb wall" [...] - a <b>movable</b> <b>wall</b> lined with red, white and blue light bulbs, which would act as a curtain.

The studio was located at the fictional [...] "Super Dave Compound" [...] - [...] a combination resort/theme park/learning center/etc. (anything needed for a particular episode). In the first season, in 1987, the compound was {{often referred to as the}} [...] "stunt compound" [...] or [...] "Super Dave Complex". In the second season, the show moved to a different studio. It featured the same stage setup - the bulb wall and the billboard sign behind it; however, the studio was much larger. In the original studio, the stage was at the lowest point in the studio and was surrounded by a semicircle of bleacher-style seats (It was the same studio where Bizarre was taped, the Glen Warren Studios at CFTO-TV in Toronto). The new studio was a typical theater with a raised stage, a balcony of seating and private boxes. This was the Markham Theatre in Markham, Ontario.|$|E
