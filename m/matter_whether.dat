5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first. Many favored Leaf's stronger arm and greater potential, while others deemed Manning the more mature player and the safer pick. Most observers, however, believed {{that it would not}} greatly <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy of}} this Government is universally known. The {{people of the}} United States are opposed to predatory {{activities}} no <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> they are carried on {{by the use of}} force or by the threat of force. They are likewise opposed to any form of intervention on the part of one state, however powerful, in the domestic concerns of any other sovereign state, however weak.|$|E

40|$|The US {{federal deficit}} has, over the years, {{remained}} {{a subject of}} widespread concern and controversy. Diverse views continue to be expressed on such questions as <b>whether</b> the deficit <b>matters,</b> <b>whether</b> it is the inflation-adjusted deficit that <b>matters,</b> <b>whether</b> bond-financed deficits are inflationary, and whether it is only deficits that are financed by money creation which are inflationary. Against this background, few would disagree with Boskin (1982) that “progress in improving {{our understanding of the}} role of the budget deficit in economic behavior and performance… is an urgent research priority”...|$|R

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

6000|$|All {{this seemed}} good reasoning, and yet {{now that we}} had {{seemingly}} settled the matter, of what did it avail us? What <b>mattered</b> <b>whether</b> the sun was shining, or the earth shrouded in darkness, so that we dared not venture out in either case? ...|$|R
6000|$|Let it, however, {{be asked}} {{of those who}} are conversant with such <b>matters,</b> <b>whether</b> he was more false than men usually are on such occasions. We English gentlemen hate the name of a lie, but how often do we find public men who believe each other's words? ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, {{during the reign}} of Stefan Batory (1576–1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (lit. drafted or {{selected}} infantry, also known as piechota łanowa, lit. acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (łan) in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– lit. chimney or łan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, no <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

25|$|Delusions do not {{necessarily}} have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.

50|$|In most {{object-oriented}} languages, objects can {{be referred}} to using references.

25|$|Since {{only the}} {{connection}} information is relevant, {{the shape of}} pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself.

25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many.

25|$|Also, {{the concept}} of a Riemannian {{manifold}} permits an expression of the Euclidean structure in any smooth coordinate system, via metric tensor.

25|$|On {{the basis}} of his early {{clinical}} work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as Freud's seduction theory. In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis {{can be traced back to}} the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.|$|E
