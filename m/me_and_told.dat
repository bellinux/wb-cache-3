5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; {{he is not}} only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|Answer. Moroni, {{the person}} who {{deposited}} the plates, from whence the book of Mormon was translated, in a hill in Manchester, Ontario County, New York, as a resurrected being, appeared unto <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me where they were; and gave me directions how to obtain them.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, it was {{revealed}} that she had paid for the medical tests for a man called Julian Jean DeBaptiste in Saint Lucia in 2009. [...] "I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it cost a fortune and Amy paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her but she just hugged <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me not to say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{sent for}} a doctor <b>and</b> for <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> the police. I'd given the {{concierge}} twenty francs, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> her to send for me if anything happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{wrote to}} <b>me,</b> Mary, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all that." [...] This he said, striving {{to hide the}} impatience which he felt; but striving in vain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Deary me, that's very kind," [...] {{said the}} old woman; [...] "but I wonder why he sent such things to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> who <b>told</b> him I was in want of 'em?" ...|$|R
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} at <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>told</b> her to shut her left eye, {{but to be}} very {{particular}} not to turn around again without lowering her pistol.|$|R

6000|$|... "Where do {{you keep}} your money?" [...] he asked <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>told</b> him that {{the greater part of}} it--all but some pocket-money--was stowed away in an inside pocket of my vest.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People came up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E
500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me that it was top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E
6000|$|... "That man started it," [...] {{declared}} Jack, {{pointing to}} Davenport. [...] "He caught hold of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>told</b> {{him to let}} me go. He {{had no right to}} put his hands on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{shall have}} her own way,--as she ought. What that way is I do not know. I have not even asked about it. She asked <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>told</b> her to speak to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I sent a slave {{with some}} grain to your sister {{to buy some}} pumpkins, {{but she would not}} sell <b>me</b> any, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there were none, though I know she lets other people buy them.' ...|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. American rock band Ween guest starred as themselves in [...] "Your Shoe's Untied". The band performed [...] "Loop de Loop", a song they written for the episode. Before SpongeBob SquarePants aired on television in 1999, Hillenburg had approached band guitarist Dean Ween to compose a song for the show. Dean Ween said [...] " [...] called <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me [...] was a marine biologist who was starting a cartoon about underwater sea creatures and that The Mollusk was a big reference point for him creatively and would we {{like to do a}} song for the show." [...] The band conceived the song and wrote it in about three minutes. Ween's 1997 song [...] "Ocean Man" [...] would also be used four years later during the end credits sequence in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and as part of the film's soundtrack. In the episode [...] "Bossy Boots", American band The Capsules performed the song [...] "Bossy Boots", which was later released on [...] in 2005.

2500|$|An {{employee}} at La Maison Bleue, his hotel, was quoted by Agence France Presse: [...] "When {{he came in}} , he was drunk. He was with a Senegalese woman and he planned to stay one night.

2500|$|Also, Gulen {{said in an}} {{interview}} with NPR: [...] "To this day, I have stood against all coups. My respect for the military aside, I have always been against interventions. ...If any one among those soldiers had called <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me of their plan, I would tell them, 'You are committing murder.' ... If they ask me what my final wish is, I would say the person [...] who caused all this suffering and oppressed thousands of innocents, I want to spit in his face." ...|$|E
2500|$|No cricket {{had come}} from Swabi before and Junaid Khan didn't take {{interest}} in cricket initially, he played with tape-ball & was introduced to hard ball set up by his cousin. At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that I should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me that I had potential and that I should go to Lahore".|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1990s, Steeleye often toured as part {{of double}} bill, {{supporting}} Status Quo, or featuring support from artists such as Rock Salt & Nails and The Rankin Family. When Steeleye Span supported Status Quo on tour in 1996, the latter had just issued their version of [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] as a single. [...] "The video was filmed at Christmas," [...] Prior recalled. [...] "We'd supported them, and I found myself down in the mosh pit. Francis saw <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> the audience, 'Oh look, there's a Maddy lookalike down there… Fuck me, it is Maddy!' I was hoyed over the barrier , to join them for the encore. It was all very jolly." [...] Status Quo's single is credited to [...] "Status Quo with Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span" [...] and reached number 47 in the charts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked her}} to marry <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to wait a year. I have waited as long as I could, but I could not wait the whole year. I have prayed a great deal, and I am bidden to speak." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{had played}} only six {{first-class}} games {{when he got}} picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says [...] "I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, {{and there was a}} match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capitalizing on {{the success}} of the 1950s big-money quiz The $64,000 Question on CBS, Barry and Enright {{developed}} their flagship show, Twenty One, a quiz which had a scoring system based loosely on Blackjack. Contestants were placed in twin isolation booths and asked questions ranging in value from one to 11 points — the higher the point value, the more difficult the question. Enright described the initial broadcast of Twenty One as [...] "a dismal failure. It was just plain dull." [...] Contestants repeatedly missed questions and, in Enright's own words, [...] "It lacked all drama; it lacked all suspense. The next morning the sponsor (Geritol) called my partner, Jack Barry, and <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> us in no uncertain terms that he never wanted to see a repeat of what happened the previous night. And from that moment on, we decided to rig Twenty One." [...] Even with rigging, initial ratings were unimpressive.|$|E

Morissette was tasked to interview Jessie J for the music channel MYX and during the interview she mentioned that she sang one of her songs when she joined The Voice of the Philippines. Jessie J then requested Amon to sing in front of her, and despite being hesitant, she sang {{a portion of the}} singer's hit song [...] "Who You Are." [...] This impressed Jessie J so much that she immediately decided to invite Amon to join her onstage during her concert later in the evening. The singer even took to Instagram to express her admiration at Morissette's talent, saying [...] "“The moment @itsmorissette sang to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> me she auditioned for The Voice Philippines and came 2nd... So great! So I invited her out to sing with me. Love when this happens.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, and I say {{you ought}} to. If {{they had only}} left <b>me</b> alone <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing about it, it would have mattered much less.
