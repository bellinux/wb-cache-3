50|$|For {{unambiguous}} results, the antennas {{should be}} spaced half a wavelength apart, or less. However, this {{can result in}} significant <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between elements, which means that each antenna's phase measurement will be corrupted by the other's. The approach assumes that the phase centres of the antennas are exactly known. With more complex antenna structures (such as the log-periodic antenna) the effects of <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> can make the phase centre locations unknown. In this case, calibration or electromagnetic modeling may be required.|$|E

50|$|Strong {{surface waves}} of {{sufficient}} strength, which propagate {{on the metal}} ground plane will reach the edge and propagate into free space. This creates a multi-path interference. In contrast the HIS surface suppresses the propagation of surface waves. Furthermore, control of the radio frequency or microwave radiation pattern is efficiently increased, and <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between antennas is also reduced.|$|E

50|$|Power {{handling}} {{capability is}} also doubled {{when the number}} of drivers doubles, for a maximum realizable increase of ~6 dB in total acoustic output per doubling of mutually coupled drivers when the total amplifier power is also doubled. <b>Mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency gains become difficult to realize with multiple drivers at higher frequencies because the total size of a single driver including its diaphragm, basket, waveguide or horn may already exceed one wavelength.|$|E
50|$|These antennas {{operate in}} 3 ways: {{traveling}} wave, fast wave and leaky wave. The traveling wave, formed on spiral arms, allows for broadband performance, fast wave due to <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> phenomenon occurring between arms of spiral and leaky wave leaks the energy during propagation through the spiral arms to produce radiation. Ring theory (band theory) explains the working principle of spiral antenna. The theory states that spiral antenna radiates from a region called active region where {{the circumference of}} spiral equals wavelength.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{capacitive}} sensing system: mutual capacitance, where the object (finger, conductive stylus) alters the <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between row and column electrodes, which are scanned sequentially; and self- or absolute capacitance where the object (such as a finger) loads the sensor or increases the parasitic capacitance to ground. In both cases, the difference of a preceding absolute position from the present absolute position yields the relative motion of the object or finger during that time. The technologies are elaborated in the following section.|$|E

40|$|We examine {{synchronization}} {{of identical}} chaotic systems coupled in a drive/response manner. A rigorous criterion is presented which, if satisfied, guarantees that synchronization to the driving trajectory is linearly stable to perturbations. An {{easy to use}} approximate criterion for estimating linear stability is also presented. One major advantage of these criteria is that, for simple systems, many of the calculations needed to implement them can be performed analytically. Geometrical interpretations of the criterion are discussed, {{as well as how}} they may be used to investigate synchronization between <b>mutual</b> <b>coupled</b> systems and the stability of invariant manifolds within a dynamical system. Finally, the relationship between our criterion and results from control theory are discussed.

50|$|In {{conventional}} models, the Ampere {{force is}} neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This {{is called a}} kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.|$|E
50|$|The Hartley {{oscillator}} is {{the dual}} of the Colpitts oscillator {{which uses a}} voltage divider made of two capacitors rather than two inductors. Although there is no requirement {{for there to be}} <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal tapping point (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a bipolar junction transistor, FET, triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an inverting amplifier or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a junction FET (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus distortion reduction) can be achieved with a simple grid leak resistor-capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to diode conduction on signal peaks building up enough negative bias to limit amplification.|$|E
50|$|In general, a {{microwave}} imaging system has two parts, namely: {{hardware and software}} (or post-processing). The hardware part collects data from the sample under test. A transmitter antenna sends EM waves towards the sample under test (e.g., human body for medical imaging). If the sample is made of only homogeneous material which extends to infinity, theoretically no EM wave will be reflected. Introduction of any anomaly which has different properties (i.e., electrical/magnetic) {{in comparison with the}} surrendering homogeneous medium may reflect a portion of the EM wave. The bigger the difference between the properties of the anomaly and the surrounding medium is, the stronger the reflected wave will be. This reflection will be collected and measured by the same antenna (in monostatic case) or a different receiver antenna (in bistatic case).To increase cross-range resolution of the imaging system, several antennas should be distributed over an area (which is called sampling area) with a spacing less than the operating wavelength. However, by having several antennas placed close to each other, the <b>mutual</b> <b>coupling</b> between antennas may degrade the accuracy of the collected signals. Moreover, transmitter and receiver system will become very complex. To address these problems, one single scanning antenna is used instead of several antennas. Later, when the antenna finishes scanning the entire sampling area, one can put together collected data all over the sampling area and process them together, simultaneously. In fact, a synthetic (virtual) aperture is produced by moving the antenna (similar to the synthetic aperture radar principle). Later, the collected data, which is sometimes referred to as raw data, is fed into the software for processing. Depending on the applied processing algorithm, microwave imaging techniques can be categorized as quantitative and qualitative.|$|E
