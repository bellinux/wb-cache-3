5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell <b>my</b> <b>white</b> friends, we {{as black}} people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
25|$|During the tour, the {{increasingly}} difficult relationship between Chadwick and Bickers worsened and Bickers was abruptly sacked mid-tour. At one day's notice, Simon Walker was recruited directly from <b>My</b> <b>White</b> Bedroom and The Dave Howard Singers as replacement lead guitarist. He made his debut at the band's concert at Portsmouth Polytechnic on 4 December 1989.|$|E
25|$|Despite Evans' {{claims of}} having retired from music, {{both he and}} Chris Groothuizen {{continued}} for three more years with <b>My</b> <b>White</b> Bedroom. Groothuizen would subsequently coproduce and engineer the debut album for British chansonnier Simon Warner in 1996 before taking on a new career as an architect and lecturer. From 1994 onwards, Evans began an ongoing collaboration as producer and musician with teenaged singer-songwriter Cat Goscovitch. He contributing heavily to her projects Billy Rain (1994) and Nut (1996) as drummer, guitarist and co-songwriter, and returned {{as one of her}} key collaborators in 2010.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of <b>my</b> <b>white</b> skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race {{is not a man}} at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 1991, the House of Love {{performed}} three London concerts on {{the same}} night – the first at the University of London Union in Bloomsbury, the second at the Town & Country Club in Kentish Town and the third at The Boston Arms in Tufnell Park. Despite the publicity stunt nature of the evening, the band received good reviews and it was considered that their challenge had paid off. However (and considering their level of action) the band was about to enter a fairly long phase of creative torpor. Exhausted by touring, Chadwick and the band kept a low profile for the closing months of 1990 and for most of 1991. While Chadwick rested, Evans, Walker and Groothuizen took advantage of the time off to return to <b>My</b> <b>White</b> Bedroom, which released its lone album in 1991 after two years of delay.|$|E

In his biography Grant confessed [...] "I was younger {{than all of the}} sixteen players, save three; and most of these sixteen had already played for the West Indies, while I had not. Yet I was the captain. It could not be disputed that <b>my</b> <b>white</b> colour was a major factor in my being given this post." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 28, 1949, Quezón left her home to travel to her husband's {{hometown}} of Baler to open the Quezon Memorial Hospital. She had been cautioned about this trip beforehand due to the frequent insurgency activities in Central Luzon of the Hukbalahap, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines. She shrugged off the threat, remarking on {{the morning of}} the trip, [...] " [...] Taruc knows <b>my</b> <b>white</b> hair and he will not hurt me." [...] Nonetheless, a convoy of thirteen vehicles, including two military jeeps full of armed soldiers, accompanied Quezón.

2500|$|Although {{activities}} like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I’m not just me, I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until <b>my</b> <b>white</b> friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{his presidential}} campaign, Obama stated that lobbyists [...] "won't {{find a job}} in <b>my</b> <b>White</b> House", but {{softened}} his stance after taking office. On January 21, 2009, Obama issued an executive order for all future appointees to his administration, which ordered that no appointee who was a registered lobbyist within the two years before his appointment could participate on matters in which he lobbied {{for a period of}} two years after the date of appointment. Three formal waivers were initially issued in early 2009, out of 800 executive appointments: The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington criticized the administration, claiming that Obama retreated from his own ethics rules barring lobbyists from working on the issues about which they lobbied during the previous two years by issuing waivers. A 2015 Politico investigation found that, while Obama had instituted incremental reforms and the number of lobbyists fell during Obama's presidency, Obama had failed to close the [...] "revolving door" [...] of officials moving between government and business. However, Juliet Eilperin of the Washington Post noted that the Obama administration avoided [...] "conflict of interest" [...] scandals that previous administrations had experienced, in part due to the administration's lobbyist rules.|$|E
