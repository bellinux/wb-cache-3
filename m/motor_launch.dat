5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one <b>motor</b> <b>launch,</b> three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{upon the}} {{information}} provided by the Yugoslav Partisans, the Royal Navy sortied two Type II Hunt-class destroyers, HMS Avon Vale and HMS Wheatland, from their base at the Ist Island at 17:00 on 1 November. Wheatland was under command of Lieutenant Hugh Askew Corbett, while Avon Vale was under Lieutenant Ivan Hall. The destroyers were accompanied by motor torpedo boats MTB 295, MTB 287 and MTB 274, motor gun boats MGB 642, MGB 638 and MGB 633 and <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> ML494. The destroyers were tasked with landing a team of South African coast watchers on the north tip of Rab, the MTBs with patrolling the Kvarner Gulf between Rab and Krk islands, {{while the rest of the}} force loitered southwest, near Premuda. Morgan-Giles commanded the force.|$|E
5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} {{three weeks and}} on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft {{into the water and}} this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E

Bagot spent two years in motor launches on mostly anti-submarine and defensive duties within the Dover fleet, which was tasked with defending {{the southern end of the}} English Channel between Dover and Dunkirk.

25|$|The Hibbard-Swenson Company diesel {{auxiliary}} schooner Kamchatka (formerly the whaling bark Thrasher) {{was lost}} to fire in the Bering Sea April 14, 1921. The crew, including Swenson, escaped without loss of life and reached Alaska in a <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> and a whaleboat. They had no water and subsisted on wieners and oranges from the cargo, running the launch's engine on distillate {{due to a lack}} of gasoline.|$|E
25|$|A second fatal {{accident}} occurred November 1, 1958, when Henry Sause, Jr., then the company's president, {{and two other}} men went out in a <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> to take soundings on a sand bar in the Siletz River. The launch capsized in heavy seas while they were seeking a route to get the stranded tug Columbia out to sea. Henry Sause managed to swim to shore, but the other two, Mel Jorgenson and Ralph Hunt, were drowned.|$|E

25|$|Having {{learned from}} attacks in Canadian waters {{during the early}} weeks of the Battle of the St. Lawrence, a series of armed {{military}} ships escorted the convoy at various times during its short journey. The corvette Arrowhead, with the escort commander, Commander E.G. Skinner aboard and the minesweeper Truro were positioned port and starboard respectively of the lead merchant vessel. The <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> Q-083 was situated {{in front of the}} convoy while Q-065 was positioned astern of the last merchant ship. Further to the naval escort, three Hudson light bombers operating from the airfield at Mont-Joli provided air cover during daylight hours.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1918, {{the engine}} room of HM <b>Motor</b> <b>Launch</b> 356 {{exploded}} at Dunkirk quay, and the forward petrol tanks burst into flames. Several of the launch's crew were blown overboard by the explosion, while the remainder were driven off by the fire. Flames soon began to issue forth from the cabin, and burning petrol spread {{on the surface of}} the water. As others proceeded to flee the scene, Bagot, along with Lieutenant Robin Hoare, realised the fire was threatening the aft petrol tanks and the depth charges located on board the launch. Jumping in a dinghy, the pair rowed out towards the blaze. On reaching the wreck, Bagot and Hoare removed the depth charges despite the flames; thus preventing any further explosion.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December news reached Alden and Barker that two days earlier Japanese {{aircraft}} had sunk the US gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River near Nanjing. Alden and Barker discreetly prepared racks of ammunition for their 4"/50 caliber guns, but the IJN ships continued to stand by and assist. President McKinley moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of President Hoovers passengers and about 230 of her crew. Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet President McKinleys boats and a <b>motor</b> <b>launch,</b> which then ferried {{them out to the}} liner. President McKinley then left for Manila, leaving behind President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to.|$|E

25|$|In Royal Indian Navy (RIN) service, crewing LCAs {{followed}} {{somewhat similar}} lines. By mid-1941 {{members of the}} RIN Reserve and RIN Volunteer Reserve were being trained to operate LCA. In 1942, the RIN began receiving four battalions of Indian army troops to provide crews for landing craft. Seven hundred soldiers of the 9/1st Punjab Regiment volunteered for such a transfer in February 1943. The 15/13th Frontier Force Rifles Regiment voted similarly. These battalions were transferred {{despite the fact that}} few of the men had ever seen the sea. Their training suffered severely from lack of landing craft, spares, and trained instructors. From around mid-1943 there was also a Burma Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in existence working closely among LCA and LCS crews. By 1945, the BRNVR seems to have been formed into the 59th <b>Motor</b> <b>Launch</b> Flotilla. In all likelihood, it had been put together at least partly from those with maritime experience escaping from the 1942 Japanese onslaught in Burma.|$|E
25|$|In early June 1944, Versatile {{deployed}} in The Solent with Force J to escort convoys {{to the invasion}} beaches, and she and a Royal Navy Coastal Forces <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> joined Convoy J 14 – consisting of the infantry landing ship , 12 infantry landing craft, 24 tank landing craft, two antiaircraft landing craft, one rocket tank landing craft, and one United States Coast Guard vessel – as its escort on 4 June 1944. The invasion was postponed from 5 to 6 June due to bad weather, but on 5 June Convoy J 14 began its voyage to Juno Beach, arriving at its launch point on 6 June 1944 {{half an hour before}} the landings. On 7 June, Versatile embarked Rear Admiral William G. Tennant, who was in command of the Mulberry harbour operation and of the undersea pipeline effort known as Operation Pluto, to witness the sinking of blockships off Sword Beach to form a Mulberry harbour. On 8 June 1944, she arrived at Portland to begin the daily escort of the EPL 2 series of tank landing ship convoys between the United Kingdom and the invasion beaches.|$|E

25|$|Te Uku {{is served}} by the Raglan bus and school buses, but once also had {{services}} north and south. The first Hamilton-Raglan coach ran in 1880 and became a service car route about 1916. From March 1922 a {{two and a half}} hour, Pakoka Landing to Frankton, via Te Mata, “Silver Trail”, bus service started, with a <b>motor</b> <b>launch</b> connection to Kawhia on Fridays. Problems with rough roads and tides caused it to fail. In 1938 Western Highways started a service from Kawhia to Auckland via Makomako, Te Mata, Waingaro and Tuakau (via Highway 22) and back the next day. In 1946 Brosnan Motors started a daily run, leaving Kawhia at 5.45am, arriving at Auckland at 1pm, returning at 2 pm. and back at Kawhia about 9.30pm. In 1950 Brosnan Motors sold the Raglan-Kawhia run to Norman Rankin, who ended it in 1952. Brosnan Motors sold the Raglan-Auckland run to Pavlovich Motors in 1971. The first bus used on the Auckland-Kawhia run was a 7-seater Studebaker. Then a 10-seater Dodge used by Norman Collett later gave way to a 14-seater Oldsmobile. As the roads improved 18 and 21-seater Diamond T buses took over. Later 40-seaters ran from Raglan to Auckland, until Pavlovich closed the route in 1976.|$|E
500|$|To {{assist in}} {{transporting}} the Commandos, 12 motor launches (ML) were assigned from the 20th and 28th <b>Motor</b> <b>Launch</b> flotillas. These boats were re-armed with two Oerlikon 20mm guns mounted forward and aft to complement their twin Lewis guns. At {{the last minute}} another four MLs were assigned from the 7th <b>Motor</b> <b>Launch</b> flotilla (see Footnotes for flotilla details). These four boats were also armed with two torpedoes each. Instead of transporting the Commandos, these boats were to engage any German shipping found in the estuary. All the MLs had a 500-gallon auxiliary fuel tank fixed to the upper deck to increase their range. The S class submarine [...] would leave {{before the rest of}} the convoy and be in position to act as a navigational beacon to guide the convoy into the Loire estuary.|$|E
