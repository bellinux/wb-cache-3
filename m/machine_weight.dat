40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} {{examined}} how different training affects the kinematics and applied moments {{at the knee}} during sporting maneuvers and the potential to reduce loading of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The training programs were 1) <b>machine</b> <b>weights,</b> 2) free weights, 3) balance training, and 4) <b>machine</b> <b>weights</b> + balance training. METHODS: Fifty healthy male subjects were allocated either to a control group or to one of four 12 -wk training programs. Subjects were tested before and after training, performing running and cutting maneuvers from which knee angle and applied knee moments were assessed. Data analyzed were peak applied flexion/extension, varus/valgus, and internal/external rotation moments, as well as knee flexion angles during specific phases of stance during the maneuvers. Results: The balance training group decreased their peak valgus and peak internal rotation moments during weight acceptance in all maneuvers. This group also lowered their flexion moments during the sidestep to 60 degrees. Free weights training induced increases in the internal rotation moment and decreases in knee flexion angle in the peak push-off phase of stance. <b>Machine</b> <b>weights</b> training elicited increases in the flexion moment and reduced peak valgus moments in <b>weight</b> acceptance. <b>Machine</b> <b>weights</b> + balance training resulted in no changes to the variables assessed. Conclusions: Balance training produced reductions in peak valgus and internal rotation moments, which could lower ACL injury risk during sporting maneuvers. Strength training tended to increase the applied knee loading known to place strain on the ACL, with the free weights group also decreasing the amount of knee flexion. It is recommended that balance training be implemented because it may {{reduce the risk of}} ACL injury. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{transverse}} flux motor (TFM), quite a {{new concept}} of an electric machine, begins its impetus in the late 80 s of the last century. The transverse flux reluctance motor (TFRM) is a variant of TFM with passive rotor and simpler construction. The achievable power TFRMs ’ to total <b>machine</b> <b>weight</b> ratio is smaller than for TFM with permanent magnets on the rotor (PMTFM), but larger than for conventional machines. Since TFRM has {{a large number of}} poles the motor is well suited for variable low speed direct drive applications. TFRM actual state-of-art will be presented in the paper with more strength on its construction, design, supply control and applications. Partly being a review of the already published information the paper contains some original developments concerning mainly TFRM design. the start-up difficulties and to obtain continuous rotation [6, 7]. a...|$|E

Design {{optimization}} of {{traction motors}} for light electric vehicles requires a comparative analysis {{in order to}} account for both performance and efficiency, while considering overall cost, size limitations and manufacturing complexity. This paper presents a comparative study on different surface mounted permanent magnet (SMPM) in-wheel motor configurations, facilitating fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW). On a first step, different pole / slot combinations were investigated and evaluated in terms of performance primarily. On a second step, different stator geometries were analyzed, considering both double and single layer windings and both equal and unequal stator teeth. Two different operating conditions were taken into account, i. e. nominal load and overload. The most advantageous was selected, by means of efficiency, clean interface and overall weight, using an extensive sensitivity analysis.

40|$|Thermal {{transients}} {{can cause}} {{significant changes in}} the dynamic behavior of cracked rotors. The thermal expansions of the shafts cause changes of the distribution of stresses and strains, whose effects can give rise to the separation or the contact between portions of the surfaces of transverse cracks. This phenomenon can cause significant changes of the local flexural stiffness of the rotor, in the area close to the cracked section, and of the shaft lateral vibrations. However, this phenomenon must not be confused with the crack breathing, that is the periodic opening and closure of a transverse crack, caused by the <b>machine</b> <b>weight,</b> which occurs over a complete revolution of horizontal shafts. This paper is focused on the study of the effects of thermal transients on cracked shaft vibrations. With regard to this, the results obtained by the analysis of the experimental behavior of a cracked steam turbine are shown and discussed...|$|E

With a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 88, a mean percentage error (MPE) of - 5. 49, and a mean absolute error (MAPE) of 3. 67, the cycle time model is robust; this is further validated using chi-square analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient (on predicted and actual values of machine cycle time). An illustrative example of the model's application to determine machine productivity is given. The paper concludes with a spreadsheet model for calculating excavation costs (m 3 and cost per h) which is {{able to deal with}} any combination of the three independent cycle time predictor variables and other estimator's input data...|$|E
40|$|In general, the {{propagation}} of transverse cracks in horizontal shafts of rotating machines causes {{major changes in the}} synchronous vibrations and minor but significant changes in the supersynchronous vibrations. Often, abnormal changes of the twice per revolution harmonic component of the machine vibration is considered the most important symptom of a crack propagation. However, in rotating machines subjected to considerable thermal transients, like steam and gas turbines, it is not unusual that multiple crack initiations occur at the root {{of a large number of}} blades of a single wheel. This type of failure may generate annular transverse cracks. This paper shows the results of a parametric analysis performed to study the effects of the basic geometrical characteristics of annular cracks on the periodic changes of the local flexural stiffness of the shaft, caused by the <b>machine</b> <b>weight,</b> as well as on the machine dynamic behaviour. This investigation has shown that annular cracks cause only minor changes of the shaft supersynchronous vibrations.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a complex}} mechanism which results in a decrease of soil porosity and an increase of soil strength. Such effects may reduce crop yield since they are harmful for root growth, germination, mesofauna and bacterial life. Soil compaction may also reduce hydraulic conductivity which {{increases the risk of}} runoff, contamination of surface water, erosion and emission of greenhouse gases due to anaerobic processes. In the context of sustainable agriculture, it is crucial to characterise the impact of the agricultural techniques on the compaction state in the arable layer due to machine traffic. For this purpose, Soil samples were taken in a Luvisol at different depths, on plots under longterm reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The impact of wheel traffic on the physical properties of the soils was also studied. The experimental approach consists in measuring traditional macroscopic soil properties such as bulk density and precompression stress, and combining them with pore size distribution obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry. Automatic cone index measurements were initially performed to map the soil resistance and easily identify the sampling depths. The measurements revealed a plough pan at 30 -cm depth under both CT and RT. Nevertheless, the subsoil under RT showed pieces of evidence of a natural regeneration process of the microporosity. The impact of wheel traffic was studied in RT and CT plots. It was shown that the passage of heavy machine such as beet harvester coupled to water content close to the optimum proctor is clearly unfavourable in terms of compaction. The measurements revealed large modifications of soil structure in the topsoil of CT, whereas the soil structure slightly changes through depth. However, the latter remains the more problematic case since the soil will not be loosened by tillage anymore, resulting in strongly compacted soil years after years. In addition to the experimental approach, numerical modelling was used in order to predict the soil compaction. A finite element method was used and the soil behaviour was modelled by an elastoplastic law (modified Cam-Clay model). The model parameters were calibrated from the experimental measurements. The simulations allowed to compare the porosity and the surface deformation after wheel traffic with the experiments. The variations of <b>machine</b> <b>weight</b> and tyre pressure were numerically studied and it was showed that the <b>machine</b> <b>weight</b> has an influence in the topsoil and the subsoil, whereas the tyre pressure affects only the topsoil...|$|E
40|$|A new {{structure}} of field excitation flux switching motor (FEFSM) {{as an alternative}} candidate of non-Permanent Magnet (PM) machine for HEV drives is presented in this thesis. Design principles and initial performances of the proposed motor with 12 stator slots and 14 rotor pole are demonstrated. Initially, the coil arrangement tests are examined to validate the operating principle of the motor and to certify the zero rotor position. Furthermore, the profile of flux linkage,cogging torque, torque versus Ja at various Je characteristics and torque versus power characteristics are observed and analyzed based on 2 D-finite element analysis (FEA). The improvement design is done by using the “deterministic optimization method” to achieve the restriction and spesification target compared to Interior Permenant Magnet Synchronous Machines (IPMSM) that used in HEV drives. “The results obtained show that proposed 12 S- 14 P FEFSM achieved the target performance for maximum power, maximum torque density, maximum power density and <b>machine</b> <b>weight,</b> while the maximum torque is not achieved as a target.

A concept of integrating more than one tribo-technique at different contact mechanisms (line or area) working simultaneously under same test condition against same material is introduced in a current designed machine. Different wear modes (adhesive, two-body-abrasive, three-body-abrasive, under dry, lubricated, or slurry conditions) can be conducted on the same machine.
