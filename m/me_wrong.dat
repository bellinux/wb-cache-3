25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> honey, if you wanna to/You can do <b>me</b> <b>wrong</b> honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews were {{critical}} of the Scranton sub-plot. McNutt wrote that, [...] "Andy getting hit by a girl plays into the most weak, infantile parts of his character, and making Pam his accomplice was a complete non-starter." [...] Kratzer wrote, [...] "Don't get <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> the idea of Andy getting punched in the face by a female fifth grader isn't necessarily unbelievable or unfunny, it's just that it had so little relevance or realism {{that it was difficult}} to follow for more than five minutes and it constituted an entire plot line." ...|$|E

[...] A few weeks later, in late October, the St. Louis Rams called Favre after their starting quarterback Sam Bradford was lost for the season, but Favre declined their offer to bring him out of retirement.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} cited by Robert M. Arkin and Philip J. Mazzocco {{in their work}} [...] "Self-Esteem in Springfield", in the {{compilation}} book The Psychology of The Simpsons. Arkin and Mazzocco note an exchange between Edna Krabappel and Seymour Skinner, where Skinner exclaims to Krabappel: [...] "Oh come on Edna: We both know these kids have no future! [...] Prove <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> kids. Prove me wrong." [...] Arkin and Mazzocco note that this example {{is seen as an}} exception, writing: [...] "Generally, however, the Simpsons are right on target in their understanding of the importance of self-esteem and the dynamics involved in the interplay between the social world and positive self-regard." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett {{said that}} Michael {{falling in love}} with the chair model was [...] "a hysterical turn and {{highlights}} just how deluded Michael – and Dwight – can be". Fickett was critical of the [...] "parking" [...] storyline, saying that it was [...] "a bit over the top and runs a bit thin", but he did think that the scene at the end with Kevin was [...] "a sweet and genuine moment". Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly stated that, in relation to the previous episode [...] "Dinner Party", [...] "Last night's show took another approach. Don't get <b>me</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was a blinder—but a totally different animal, so to speak." [...] D'Arminio went on to praise the dual plots of the episode.|$|E

He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. This is something that Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, but I love non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really hit the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat <b>me</b> <b>wrong</b> / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
500|$|THEM Anime Review's Carlos Ross said, [...] "The voice-acting is remarkable, the {{directing}} is solid, {{and music}} is quite competent. But the real kicker {{here is the}} animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic...there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never {{gets a chance to}} be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance". IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow said, [...] "While [...] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don't get <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more". Mania's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining [...] the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, [...] "the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real 'flaw' that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there’s a slight stutter that’s simply inherent in the materials". DVDs Worth Watching's Johanna Draper Carlson said, [...] "the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy".|$|E

2500|$|Voice of Desmond Miles, Nolan North, urged Ubisoft {{to adopt}} motion capture methods similar to Naughty Dog's Uncharted. Speaking in an interview, North {{admitted}} there's a [...] "disconnect" [...] in the Ubisoft game's current setup, which has voice actors provide voice facial animation separately from body motion capture, which is recorded by different actors. [...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't get <b>me</b> <b>wrong,</b> the mo-cap actors {{do a great}} job, but {{there will always be}} somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way.

In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote Ferguson questioning the progress given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found. Replying to Hougey, as well as other secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated 5 June 1972: [...] "Ten years have passed ....

2500|$|An anecdote {{characteristic}} of rabbinical sympathy for inferiors and domestics is thus related: The wife of R.
