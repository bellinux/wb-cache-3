60|$|To make 8 lbs. of gunpowder, take 1 lb. of charcoal, 1 lb. of sulphur, and 6 lbs. of saltpetre. These {{proportions}} {{should be}} followed as accurately as possible. Each {{of the three}} materials must be pounded into powder separately, and then all mixed together most thoroughly. The mixture must have a little water added to it, Enough to make it bind into a stiff paste (about one-tenth part, by measure, of water is sufficient; that is to say, one cupful of water to ten cupfuls of the <b>mixed</b> <b>powder).</b> The paste must be well kneaded together, with one stone on another, just as travellers usually make meal or grind coffee. It should then be wrapped up {{to a piece of}} canvas, or a skin, and pressed, with as heavy a pressure as can be obtained, to condense it. Next, the cake is squeezed and worked against a sieve made of parchment, in which the holes have been burnt with a red-hot wire, and through which the cake is squeezed in grains. These grains are now put into a box, which is well shaken about, and in this way the grains run each other smooth. The fine dust that is then found mixed with the grains, must be winnowed away; lastly the grains are dried.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a rapid chemometrical method based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine indomethacin (IMC) polymorphic content in mixed pharmaceutical powder and tablets. <b>Mixed</b> <b>powder</b> samples with known polymorphic contents of forms α and γ were obtained from physical mixing of 50 % of IMC standard polymorphic sample and 50 % of excipient <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> sample consisting of lactose, corn starch, and hydroxypropyl-cellulose. The tablets were obtained by compressing the <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> at 245 MPa. X-ray powder diffraction profiles and NIR spectra were recorded for 6 kinds of standard materials with various polymorphic contents. The principal component regression analysis was performed based on normalized NIR spectra sets of <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> standard samples and tablets. The relationships between the actual and predicted polymorphic contents of form g in the <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> measured using x-ray powder diffraction and NIR spectroscopy show a straight line with a slope of 0. 960 and 0. 995, and correlation coefficient constants of 0. 970 and 0. 993, respectively. The predicted content values of unknown samples by x-ray powder diffraction and NIR spectroscopy were reproducible and in close agreement, but those by NIR spectroscopy had smaller SDs than those by x-ray powder diffraction. The results suggest that NIR spectroscopy provides a more accurate quantitative analysis of polymorphic content in pharmaceutical <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> and tablets than does conventional x-ray powder diffractometry...|$|E

The better nonlinear properties of solution coating route varistors have been attributed to the presence of uniform potential barriers throughout the entire microstructure, which in turn is credited to the uniform distribution of dopant ions at each grain and grain boundary region.

40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to explore {{feasibility}} to develop 	an open gradient magnetic separator for <b>mixed</b> <b>powder</b> under 	dry condition.

As 	a result, it is found that the separation efficiency became lower 	as the particle size of the mixed particles became smaller. This is 	supposed to be caused by the cohesive force between the particles 	of ferrite and alumina which are easily affected by the magnetic 	drag force and the gravity difference. But the result is encouraging 	because the separation efficiency will be enhanced if the magnetic 	gradient is increased and if air flow in the separator is optimized 	in the appropriate system of the open-gradient magnetic separator 	proposed in this paper...|$|E
