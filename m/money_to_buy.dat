The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E

On 9 October 1986 Mr Pitt charged any securities he had then deposited or thereafter deposited in favour of the Union Bank of Switzerland. It appears that he never liquidated any part of his holding {{and that he was}} charging securities he had bought with the moneys borrowed from the plaintiff in order <b>to</b> borrow more <b>moneys</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> more shares. For a time, he was highly successful with his investments in that at one stage he was a millionaire on paper. In October 1987 the Stock Market crashed, his creditor banks sold the securities charged to them and Mr Pitt found himself in arrears in paying what was due under the charge. At the time of the trial in July 1992, the total sum owing under the legal charge was nearly £219,000, which exceeded the value of the family home.|$|R

5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles.

These require <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying.

5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> release prints.

Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
