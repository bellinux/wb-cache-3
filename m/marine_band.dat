5|$|Sousa {{began his}} career playing violin and {{studying}} music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the United States <b>Marine</b> <b>Band</b> as an apprentice in 1868. After departing the band in 1875, Sousa learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and the writing of music. He eventually rejoined the <b>Marine</b> <b>Band</b> and served there for 12 years as director. On leaving the <b>Marine</b> <b>Band,</b> Sousa organized his own band. Sousa aided {{in the development of}} the sousaphone, a large brass instrument similar to the helicon and tuba. At the outbreak of World War I, Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant commander and led the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. Following his tenure, he returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. In the 1920s he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but never saw active service again.|$|E
5|$|He {{organized}} The Sousa Band {{the year}} he left the <b>Marine</b> <b>Band.</b> The Sousa Band toured from 1892 to 1931, performing at 15,623 concerts both in America and around the world, including at the World Exposition in Paris, France and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In Paris, the Sousa Band marched through the streets to the Arc de Triomphe– one of only eight parades the band marched in over its forty years.|$|E
40|$|Geochemical {{studies on}} Upper Carboniferous <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> showed that marked {{enrichment}} in redox-sensitive trace elements (uranium (U), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo)) mostly occur if they contain Goniatites. Goniatites indicate deposition in relatively distal and deep marine environments. In contrast, Westphalian <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> {{found in the}} Netherlands predominantly show a Lingula facies, indicating deposition in a nearshore environment. These Lingula <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> are mostly lacking significant trace element enrichments. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explain the mechanisms causing the differences in geochemical characteristics between distal (Goniatites facies) and proximal (Lingula facies) <b>marine</b> <b>bands.</b> Geochemical analyses (total organic carbon (TOC), sulfur (S), major and trace elements) were carried out on a selection of these <b>marine</b> <b>bands.</b> Furthermore, a comparison was made with some lacustrine bands which broadly show the same sedimentary development as the Lingula <b>marine</b> <b>bands.</b> The results show that the Lingula <b>marine</b> <b>bands,</b> in contrast to the Goniatites and lacustrine bands, are characterised by low organic carbon contents (1 - 2 wt. %). A relatively high input of siliciclastics probably prevented the accumulation of organic-rich layers (dilution effect). In turn, low organic carbon contents most likely prevented the effective scavenging of trace elements. Although the lacustrine bands are characterised by high TOC contents, here the limited availability of trace elements in fresh water forms the best explanation for low trace metal enrichments. Since <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> form stratigraphically important horizons in the Upper Carboniferous, many attempts have been made to recognise <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> using well logs (gamma-ray). The results from this study show that using gamma-ray devices (detecting U-enrichments), only <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> in a Goniatites facies are clearly recognised while Lingula <b>marine</b> <b>bands</b> are not detected...|$|R

5|$|The Philippine Constabulary Band was the {{principal}} military band of the Philippine Constabulary, and later, as the Philippine Army Orchestra, of the Army of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Between its establishment in 1901 and dissolution during World War II, it registered a reputation for musical excellence both in the Philippines and the United States, and is credited with being the first band other than the United States <b>Marine</b> <b>Band</b> to provide the musical escort to the President of the United States during a U.S. presidential inauguration. The Philippine Army Band considers itself the successor to the Philippine Constabulary Band.|$|E
5|$|John Philip Sousa {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., the third of ten {{children}} of João António de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (Seville, 22 September 1824 - 27 April 1892), who was of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry (son of João António de Sousa and wife Josefina Blanco, from Seville), and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkhaus (Darmstadt, 20 May 1826 - 25 August 1908), who was of Hessian ancestry (daughter of Peter Trinkhaus and wife Catherine Schafers). Sousa started his music education by playing the violin as a pupil of John Esputa and George Felix Benkert for harmony and musical composition {{at the age of}} six. He was found to have absolute pitch. During his childhood, Sousa studied voice, violin, piano, flute, cornet, baritone horn, trombone, and alto horn. When Sousa was 13, his father, a trombonist in the <b>Marine</b> <b>Band,</b> enlisted him in the United States Marine Corps as an apprentice to keep him from joining a circus band.|$|E

Wheelock was compared at the time to John Philip Sousa, and nominated to be bandmaster of the United States <b>Marine</b> <b>Band.</b> At the age of 40 he became an American Indian rights activist and attorney, and within several years was arguing cases for Indian nations at the United States Court of Claims and US Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Feiker put {{together}} a group of local civic organizations to erect the tree {{in the center of}} the Ellipse and decorate it, and the U.S. electrical industry donated $5,000 worth of electrical cables (which were buried under the Ellipse and provided the tree with electricity). The site for the tree was personally approved by Grace Coolidge. Arrangements were also made to have 3,000 city school children present to sing Christmas carols and the United States <b>Marine</b> <b>Band</b> to play music. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) agreed to broadcast the event on radio. The tree was decorated with more than 2,500 electric bulbs in red, white, and green donated by the Electric League of Washington.|$|E

25|$|In June 1966, Helms was {{appointed}} Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). At the White House later that month, he {{was sworn in}} during a ceremony arranged by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, which included members of Congress and featured a <b>marine</b> <b>band.</b> In April of the prior year John McCone had resigned as DCI. Johnson then had appointed Admiral William Raborn, well regarded {{for his work on}} the submarine-launched Polaris missile, as the new DCI (1965–1966). Johnson immediately chose Helms to serve as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI). Raborn and Helms soon journeyed to the LBJ ranch in Texas. Notwithstanding, Raborn did not fit well into the institutional complexities at CIA, with its specialized intellectual culture. He resigned in 1966.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundraising}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{to pay for}} the memorial. On June 10, 1906. Mrs. Capron had organized a party to raise money for a monument.

President Theodore Roosevelt donated a large number of American Beauty roses from the White House Rose Garden. Another fund-raiser was held on February 8, 1907, when members of the 13th Cavalry and the 4th Battery, U.S. Light Field Artillery, put on a display of horsemanship at Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. President Roosevelt and most of Washington society were expected to attend. The event drew a large crowd and raised a significant amount of money.|$|E
