50|$|There {{are only}} very minor changes between the 1988 model {{year and the}} 1989-1991 model years. In 1989, the front {{suspension}} damper rods were changed to have only two (rather than four for the 1988) holes. The front brake calipers were also changed to have screw-on covers over the <b>mounting</b> <b>pins.</b> In 1991, the oil lines were run internally through the engine, rather than externally. The Canadian model was identical to the US model except for the colors.|$|E
5000|$|When {{insulator}} is wet, {{its outer}} surface becomes conducting making the insulator less effective. The insulator has an umbrella-like design {{so that it}} can protect {{the lower part of the}} insulator from rain. To keep the inner side of the insulator dry, ridges around the insulator, [...] "rain sheds" [...] are made. These increase the creepage distance from energized wire to <b>mounting</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} quick couplers. The initial divergence is between those that can pick up any of a range of buckets and attachments by clamping onto the <b>mounting</b> <b>pins</b> for the attachment (known as [...] "pin grabbers" [...] or [...] "pin couplers") and those that work only with buckets and attachments designed to suit that quick coupler (known as [...] "dedicated"). The claimed advantage of pin-grabbers is flexibility in use in that a machine owner can use a variety of buckets and attachments without changing the quick coupler or buying an adaptor. The claimed advantages of dedicated couplers depend on their individual design but often include better performance and smaller size.|$|E
50|$|On 24 September 1971, a Vickers VC10 1103 (registration: G-ASIX) {{was hit by}} {{clear air}} {{turbulence}} (CAT) en route from Santiago de Chile to Buenos Aires while operating the first sector of BCal's weekly Santiago-Gatwick schedule. While the aircraft was cruising above the Andes, it encountered CAT above the mountain peaks. This resulted in the aircraft being thrown up on to its side at a greater-than-90-degree angle, and then tossed, headlong, nose down, towards the up to 27,000 ft high peaks just a few thousand feet (several hundred metres) below. The severity of this incident injured an air hostess who {{was working in the}} rear galley and knocked out the powered control units (PCUs) of almost every flight control surface, leaving the aircraft to plummet downwards at a speed approaching Mach 1. The crew managed a successful recovery and reset the aircraft's PCUs. Following the aircraft's safe landing at Buenos Aires, a thorough ground check was performed before the aircraft was allowed to resume its flight to Gatwick. A detailed inspection of the aircraft at Gatwick revealed a fracture in one of the tail fin support spars, necessitating a lengthy repair. On an airliner with wing-mounted engines under the same circumstances, the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>pins</b> would probably have snapped.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{stint as}} Platoon Leader and the {{subsequent}} XO for H Co, Baker began working with the Armor and Engineering Board to draft blueprints of a revolutionary new prototype rack. The advantages of the rack's unique [...] "quick disconnect" [...] design featured the use of standard quick disconnect pins already in use as fasteners on the tank's armored skirts. These pins enabled the easy removal of the bustle rack should it become damaged during combat or training operations. Removing the handful of lower <b>mounting</b> <b>pins</b> allowed the rack to be [...] "pivoted" [...] onto the blowout panels located on top and {{to the rear of}} the turret. Pivoting the rack eliminated interference between the rack and the back deck panel, providing unobstructed access to the tank's power plant during maintenance operations. The rack became widely known around the Army's Armor community as [...] "The Baker Bustle". The rack quickly gained popularity among M1 tankers and the fielded design, though slightly modified by General Dynamics Land Systems, is still the rack seen on M1A1 tanks in combat today, though as you can see from the inset photo, some units have modified their M1's with an extended framework added to the standard bustle rack for additional stowage capacity.

40|$|Radiation {{damage is}} one of the {{bottlenecks}} in the field of structural biology. Cryo-cooling of protein crystals provided a breakthrough in the 1980 s and resulted in significant reductions in radiation damage. Other factors positively influencing the progression of damage include the application of radical scavengers and reductions in the experimental beam size. Here we study the impact on radiation damage of applying static magnetic and electric fields during protein diffraction experiments, ultimately probing the Lorenz force effect on primary photoelectrons and secondary Auger electrons, which both contribute to the damage process. The design of a special <b>mounting</b> <b>pin</b> using graphene for applying electric fields on a crystalline sample is described.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to show the design, build, and test process for a {{portable}} beer brewing rack. The rack {{is designed to be}} compact, yet still be able to hold all of the necessary components for brewing: two 15 -gallon insulated kettles, two gas burners, and an instant hot water heating system. These components can be supported in any configuration at multiple height intervals on the center tree during the brewing process. The rack is designed to be resistant to tipping over when brewing while requiring less than two square feet of floor space when stored. This report shows the design of the center tree and mounting system, the legs and hinges, and the burner and associated racks. Stress and bending calculations are shown for these components as well as the <b>mounting</b> <b>pins,</b> burner rings, and foot locking pins.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the infl uence of the {{mechanical}} environment on the healing of large segmental defects. This partly reflects the lack of standardised, well characterised technologies to enable such studies. Here we report the design, construction and characterisation of a novel external fixator for use in conjunction with rat femoral defects. This device not only imposes a predetermined axial stiffness on the lesion, but also enables the stiffness to be changed during the healing process. The main frame of the fi xator consists of polyethylethylketone with titanium alloy <b>mounting</b> <b>pins.</b> The stiffness of the fi xator is determined by interchangeable connection elements of different thicknesses. Fixators were shown to stabilise 5 mm femoral defects in rats in vivo for at least 8 weeks during unrestricted cage activity. No distortion or infections, including pin infections, were noted. The healing process was simulated in vitro by inserting into a 5 mm femoral defect, materials whose Young’s moduli approximated those of the different tissues present in regenerating bone. These studies confirmed that, although the external fixator is the major determinant of axial stiffness during the early phase of healing, the regenerate within the lesion subsequently dominates this property. There is much clinical interest in altering the mechanics of the defect to enhance bone healing. Our data suggest that, if alteration of the mechanical environment is to be used to modulate the healing of large segmental defects, this needs to be performed before the tissue properties become dominant...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} technique for the preparation of sheets of endothelial cells and to investigate the effects of bacterial endotoxin on large numbers of cells from continuous sheets of vascular endothelium. Rabbits were divided into one control and two experimental groups. The experimental animals received intracardially an LD 50 dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin. 1 and 24 hr postinjection, the vessels of the animals were perfused with glutaraldehyde in Millonig's buffer with methylene blue as a marker. Pieces of mesentery containing arteries were postfixed in buffered glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, and placed in acetone (to remove fat deposits). The surrounding connective tissue was stripped from the mesenteric arteries, and segments of the vessels were slit longitudinally, flattened out, and firmly affixed to a sheet of cork with fine <b>mounting</b> <b>pins.</b> A 3 % solution of Formvar in ethylene dichloride was pipetted onto the luminal surfaces of the vessels. The endothelial cells were impregnated with and adhered to the Formvar and, after soaking overnight in 10 N NaOH, could be stripped from the vessel walls as monolayers. Sheets of Formvar-impregnated cells were temporarily mounted on glass slides in aqueous methylene blue and examined by phase and bright-field microscopy. Methylene blue stained the nuclei a deep blue and the cytoplasm faintly, but cell outlines were indistinct. Endothelial sheets from control rabbits had smooth, elliptical nuclei oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cells and irregularly distributed over a smooth background with faint longitudinal striations. Essentially every cell in endothelial sheets from endotoxin-injected animals appeared to be severely damaged. Cell sheets from 24 hr posttreatment animals exhibited the same type of, but more extensive, damage than that observed in 1 hr posttreatment animals. The most prominent features of the damaged endothelium were distorted nuclei, apparent nuclear vacuolization, and missing nuclei. Unstained platelets and plaques were present on the surfaces of the specimens from the experimental animals only. Stained and unstained red blood cells were also dispersed over the luminal surfaces of the endotoxin-treated vessels...|$|E

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{limitations}} on the bandwidth of PIN diode switches in their different configurations is performed. The Single Pole Double Throw switch constructed with shunt <b>mounted</b> <b>PIN</b> diodes is shown to be bandlimited due to the line lengths involved in the operation. Series mounted diode switches have a wider bandwidth but the diodes cannot perform as power devices due to their physical construction. Radiation due to discontinuities were found to degrade the isolation but this was overcome by an evanescent waveguide structure. The software program TOUCHSTONE (TM) /RF by EEsof is used extensively as a basic development tool. The characterisation of the PIN diodes which {{was used by the}} software, was carried out. A bias network had to be developed to allow for the biasing of the diodes before any test boards could be fabricated. A literature survey was done on the different types of phase shifters available. A circuit which enables shifts in 45 degree increments was developed. The system consists of Reflection Phase Shifters which are made up of Quadrature Couplers that have different terminations switched in on two of their ports, a Wilkinson power splitter and a power combiner {{in the form of a}} 3 dB Quadrature Coupler. It was found that this configuration works well in theory but is too demanding on the practical components to allow for low phase shift errors to occur...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} liquid film {{thickness}} distribution of an air–water mixture flowing through a vertical 180 ° return bend are reported. Measurements of liquid film thickness were achieved using flush <b>mounted</b> <b>pin</b> and parallel wire probes. The bend has {{a diameter of}} 127 mm and a curvature ratio (R/D) of 3. The superficial velocities of air ranged from 3. 5 to 16. 1 m/s and those for water from 0. 02 to 0. 2 m/s. At these superficial velocity ranges, the flow pattern investigated in this work focused on churn and annular flows. It was found that at liquid and gas superficial velocities of 0. 02 m/s and 6. 2 m/s, respectively, the averaged liquid film thickness peak at 90 °. At gas superficial velocity of 16. 1 m/s, the relationship between them is linear due to the shear forces overcoming gravity. Additionally, {{it was found that}} deposition of entrained droplets keeps the liquid film {{on the outside of the}} bend. The results of polar plots of average liquid film thickness in the bend showed that the distribution of the liquid film is not symmetrical with thicker films on the inside of the bend due to the action of gravity. Experimental results on average liquid film thickness showed good agreement with the simulation data reported in the literature...|$|R

50|$|For {{infantry}} use, the Schwarzlose {{was usually}} {{employed as a}} traditional, tripod mounted, heavy machine gun served by a crew {{of at least three}} soldiers, one of whom was the commander, usually an NCO, a gunner who carried the weapon, a third soldier who served as an ammunition carrier and loader and he would presumably also carry the tripod although in practice a fourth soldier might be added to the team to carry the tripod. Another less commonly seen method of deployment was the more compact 'backpack mount'. In this configuration the gun was fitted with a backwards folding bipod attached {{to the front of the}} water jacket near the muzzle. The backpack mount itself consisted of a square wooden frame with a metal socket in the center. When the gun was fully deployed the frame was laid on the ground, the gun's central mounting point that usually attached to a tripod now had a small <b>mounting</b> <b>pin</b> attached to it instead which was inserted into the mounting socket in the center of the wooden backpack frame and finally the bipod was folded forward. The Schwarzlose would also have seen service as a fortress weapon in which case it would have been deployed on a variety of heavy and specialized fixed mountings and it also saw some use as a naval weapon aboard ship. During World War I the Schwarzlose was also pressed into service as an anti-aircraft gun and as such it was deployed using a variety of often improvised mountings.|$|R
