5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use}} of boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) {{only a few times}} each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
