5000|$|The Mark 2 Mod 1, Nos. 5-8, was similar, but had the hoops {{differently}} arranged, did {{not have}} integral trunnions and had its rear sights controlled by worm and <b>miter</b> <b>gears.</b> Mark 2 gun No. 7, from Chicago, was later modified into a pneumatic gun and mounted in [...] to fire a [...] aerial torpedo.|$|E
50|$|A {{bevel gear}} is {{shaped like a}} right {{circular}} cone with most of its tip cut off. When two bevel gears mesh, their imaginary vertices must occupy the same point. Their shaft axes also intersect at this point, forming an arbitrary non-straight angle between the shafts. The angle between the shafts can be anything except zero or 180 degrees. Bevel gears with equal numbers of teeth and shaft axes at 90 degrees are called <b>miter</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E
25|$|Key {{mechanical}} components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, <b>miter</b> <b>gear</b> differentials, disc/ball/roller integrators, cams (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and multipliers, and torque servos.|$|R
2500|$|A spur-gear {{differential}} has two equal-sized spur gears, one {{for each}} half-shaft, with a space between them. Instead of the Bevel gear, {{also known as a}} <b>miter</b> <b>gear,</b> assembly (the [...] "spider") at the centre of the differential, there is a rotating carrier on the same axis as the two shafts. Torque from a [...] or transmission, such as the drive shaft of a car, rotates this carrier.|$|R
40|$|An Antenna Positioner Mechanism (APM) was {{developed}} for deployment of an antenna reflector and for fine granularity closed loop tracking of the antenna in response to RF beacon error signals. By utilizing permanent magnet stepper motors, spur gearheads, irreversible single threat worm/wheel assemblies and a <b>miter</b> <b>gear</b> differential, full electrical and mechanical redundancy was realized. Two versions of this design were generated: one is a weight-optimized design with a clutch for overload protection and one is a more rugged unit without a clutch...|$|R
50|$|The {{data were}} {{transmitted}} by rotating shafts. These were mounted in ball-bearing brackets {{fastened to the}} support plates. Most corners were at right angles, facilitated by <b>miter</b> <b>gears</b> in 1:1 ratio.The Mk. 47, which was modularized into six sections on heavy-duty slides, connected the sections together with shafts {{in the back of}} the cabinet. Shrewd design meant that the data carried by these shafts required no manual zeroing or alignment; only their movement mattered. The aided-tracking output from an integrator roller is one such example. When the section was slid back into normal position, the shaft couplings mated as soon as the shafts rotated.|$|E

Mount includes right-angle drive mechanism containing two <b>miter</b> <b>gears</b> that turn threaded shaft. Shaft drives movable dovetail clamping jaw that engages fixed dovetail plate on camera. Mechanism alines camera in housing and secures it. Reduces installation time by 80 percent...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a {{versatile}} {{approach in the}} utilization of waste heat {{in the production of}} electricity, clean drinking water, and cooling. The efficiency of these cycles must be maximized to make them economical. Parameters for the optimization of ORCs such as evaporator and condenser temperature have practical limits. This is why the expander has the greatest effect in increasing the efficiency of an ORC when recovering waste heat. In this thesis the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a small scale scroll expander will be presented. Scroll expanders are positive displacement expanders that have consistently shown high efficiencies in literature. The fabricated expander was modified from a compliant scroll compressor. It was self-starting and had external control over the seal piston pressure. Spherical <b>miter</b> <b>gears</b> placed the power takeoff {{on the side of the}} expander which allowed the lubrication system designed by the compressor manufacturer to function properly. The gears had the unforeseen effect of acting as an oil mister which improved the lubrication of the scroll assembly. It was dynamically balanced to minimize vibration. This expander was demonstrated with both R 134 a and R 245 fa as working fluids with varying rotational speeds, expansion ratios, and achieved isentropic efficiencies typically over 70...|$|E
