40|$|Newly formed woody stands {{differ in}} species {{composition}} from ancient ones, {{which can be}} due to differing ecological preference of species under altered abiotic conditions in secondary stands or a limited ability of species to spread into newly formed habitats. Forest species are {{generally considered to be}} slow colonisers that prefer old forests. Not only forests but also local ancient hedges can serve as refugia for forest species, as they can serve as a source of forest-species propagules after a landscape is abandoned by humans. Shrubby stands of differing age can therefore serve as a suitable model for the study of dispersal of forest species and the relative importance of abiotic factors and biological traits of individual species for the evolution of the forest ecosystem. Areas in which large-scale changes in land use have occurred are suitable for the study of processes in hedges. Military areas in the Czech Republic are a good example. This study has been carried out in the Doupovské hory hills in West Bohemia, where a <b>military</b> <b>practice</b> <b>area</b> was founded in 1953, bringing an end to farming. Secondary shrubby vegetation colonised vast parts of the area.

40|$|Diversification into {{innovative}} domains {{through new}} <b>practice</b> <b>area</b> creation {{is a critical}} imperative for professional services firms.

A variant of this theory is offered by Byzantinist scholars, who argue the term originated in Roman <b>military</b> <b>practice,</b> and the cursarii (singular cursarius). Through Byzantine Army operations in the Balkans in the 10th and 11th centuries when Chosarioi/Chonsarioi were recruited with especially Serbs, the word was subsequently reintroduced to Western European <b>military</b> <b>practice</b> after its original usage had been lost {{with the collapse of}} Rome in the west.|$|R
