40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{climatology}} of small-scale {{patterns of}} <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> is poorly constrained, yet important for applications ranging from natural hazard assessment {{to understanding the}} geologic evolution of mountain ranges. Synthesizing four rainy seasons of high-resolution precipitation observations and mesoscale model output (from the Penn State/NCAR MM 5), reveals a persistent small-scale pattern of precipitation over the ∼ 10 km wide, ∼ 800 m high ridges and valleys of the western Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA. This pattern {{is characterized by a}} 50 – 70 % excess accumulation over the ridge crests relative to the adjacent valleys in the annual mean. While the model shows excellent skill in simulating these patterns at seasonal time-scales, major errors exist for individual storms. Investigation of a range of storm events has revealed the following mechanism for the climatological pattern. Regions of enhanced condensation of cloud water are produced by ascent in stable flow over the windward slopes of major ridges. Synoptically generated precipitation grows by collection within these clouds, leading to enhanced precipitation which is advected by the prevailing winds. Instances of atypical patterns of precipitation suggest that under certain conditions (during periods with a low freezing level, or convective cells) fundamental changes in small-scale patterns may occur. However, case-studies and composite analysis suggest that departures from the pattern of ridge-top enhancement are rare; the basic patterns and processes appear robust to changes in temperature, winds, and background rainfall rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In the Hexi area of {{northwest}} China, {{along with the}} increase of altitude, precipitation increases, air temperature and evaporation decrease. The mountainous watersheds receive much more precipitation, and possess lower temperature and lower evaporation rate as compared with the low land area, and therefore are the runoff generation area. The runoff is consumed and scattering at the low land area. In the mountainous watersheds, both the high mountain zone and the mountain vegetation zone are important to contribute the runoff generation. From east to west of the area, the runoff depth decreases and the contribution of glacier melt water to runoff increases. Both the mountainous watersheds and the low land area in front of the mountains show an increase of air temperature and precipitation. The runoff reduction in the low land area can be attributed mostly to the human activities. The yearly runoff and runoff in the summer months from the mountainous watersheds are well coorelated to the <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation.</b> The monthly runoff of April, May, September and October is well possitively correlated to air temperature, but sometimes negatively correlated to precipitation. Therefore, during those months of spring and autumn, snow melt runoff contribute most of the river runoff.

40|$|Hydrologic and ecologic {{studies in}} mountainous terrain are {{sensitive}} to the temporal and spatial distri-bution of precipitation. In this study a geostatistical model, Auto-Searched Orographic and Atmospheric Effects Detrended Kriging (ASOADeK), is introduced to map <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> using only precipi-tation gauge data. The ASOADeK model considers both precipitation spatial covariance and orographic and atmospheric effects in estimating precipitation distribution. The model employs gauge data and a multivariate linear regression approach to autosearch regional and local climatic settings (i. e., infer the spatial gradient in atmospheric moisture distribution and the effective moisture flux direction), and local orographic effects (the effective terrain elevation and aspect). The observed gauge precipitation data are then spatially detrended by the autosearched regression surface. The spatially detrended gauge data are further interpolated by ordinary kriging to generate a residual precipitation surface. The precipitation map is then constructed by adding the regression surface to the kriged residual surface. The ASOADeK model was applied to map monthly precipitation for a mountainous area in semiarid northern New Mexico. The effective moisture flux directions and spatial moisture trends identified by the optimal multiple linear regressions, using only gauge data, agree with the regional climate setting. When compared to a common precipitation mapping product [Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) ], the ASOADeK summer precipitation maps of the study area agree well with the PRISM estimates, and with higher spatial resolution. The ASOADeK winter maps improve upon PRISM estimates. ASOADeK gives better estimates than precipitation kriging and precipitation-elevation cokriging because it considers orographic and atmospheric effects more completely. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>precipitation,</b> {{as a major}} {{component}} of global ecology and culture, requires diverse observation-based distribution studies to improve process characterisation and so enhance environmental management and understanding. Analysis of data from an array of precipitation gauges within the nationally important, and internationally extreme, mountainous Lake Pukaki catchment in New Zealand has been undertaken in an effort to provide such a study, while also improving local hydrological understanding. An objective observation based undercatch-corrected 1971 - 2000 average annual precipitation distribution has been prepared for the mountainous Lake Pukaki catchment, New Zealand. Precipitation records from 58 gauges at 51 sites, augmented with 10 new gauges, were used in preparation of the distribution. The assessed undercatch correction of 17 % across the catchment indicates that mountain hydrological investigations in New Zealand that use precipitation data and yet do not consider undercatch will be in considerable error. The average annual distribution confirms the existence of high precipitation magnitudes and horizontal gradients in the catchment in comparison with other mountain regions around the world. The high magnitude is unusual when its position in the lee of the principal orographic divide is considered indicating rare precipitation distribution processes occur in the region. Consideration of river flows, glacial change and evaporation led to a confirmation of the gauge derived average catchment precipitation. Precipitation to wind direction relationships identified the predominant westerly wind to be the primary precipitation generating direction with large magnitude events biased towards the northerly direction. All directions from {{the eastern side of the}} mountain divide had the lowest frequency and daily precipitation magnitude. Derivation of wind-classed precipitation distributions identified a distinctive south east to north west precipitation gradient for all wind directions, most severe for the north west direction and least severe for the easterly direction. Precipitation extent was greatest for the northerly direction and least for the south south westerly. The wind-classed distributions enable the estimation of daily precipitation likelihood and magnitude at any location in the catchment based on knowledge of the synoptic wind flow direction and precipitation at just one reference site. Improved river flow and lake inflow estimates resulted from the use of wind classed daily precipitation estimates validating the quality of the wind classed distributions. From 1939 to 2000 there has been no statistically significant trend in precipitation magnitudes, frequencies, or extremes in the catchment. At Aoraki/Mt Cook village, in the upper catchment, there have been significant increases in magnitude, frequency and extremes associated with the phase change of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) in 1978. This change can be explained by the increase in strength of westerly winds for the different IPO phases but not by a change in frequency of different wind directions. In the lower catchment the IPO relationship is of an opposite sense to that observed in the upper catchment, indicating that the areas operate under two different climate regimes with different precipitation controls. The significant relationship to the IPO phase indicates that it is more important than climate warming in terms of future precipitation distribution in the Lake Pukaki catchment, and by extension the Southern Alps. The distributions prepared provide a valuable tool for operational and academic hydrological applications in the region. In addition, they provide a valuable characterisation of the precipitation in a Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude lee to predominant westerlies glacierized mountain catchment. From this standpoint they highlight the contrast to Northern Hemisphere <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> distributions commonly used in model validation studies, thereby providing an extension of locations with which to refine orographic precipitation process understanding...|$|E

Declining summer low flows, decreasing snow pack, higher temperatures and an increasing fraction of <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> falling as rain, raise concerns about future reliability of stream flows. These changes will likely affect the agricultural economy and the balance between in stream and agricultural water uses, requiring {{a better understanding of}} how climatic factors and access to water affect farmers' livelihoods and the basin's economy. This study focuses on two economic questions about water and agriculture in the Willamette Valley. The first question asks: how sensitive is the value of water - as reflected in farmland rents - to variations in temperature, precipitation, soil quality and elevation? The results of a hedonic analysis provide insights into the potential effects of water scarcity that may result from climate change on economic returns to farmers. The second, related question seeks to understand the factors that affect farmers' decisions to exercise their water rights. Growers in the Willamette Valley do not always use their water rights, a surprising phenomenon compared to other farming regions in the western U. S. The analysis here estimates a logit model of farmers' field-level irrigation decisions. These decisions have quantitatively large implications for the consumptive use of water in the Basin overall. The relatively low estimated values for irrigation water rights (compared to other agricultural regions) reflect these patterns of intermittent use of those water rights. The comparison, however, between the per acre value of an irrigation water right and the incremental value of precipitation suggest that water has a similar value to farmers whether it comes as a right or as rain...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Alps of New Zealand {{experience}} {{some of the}} highest precipitation rates globally, and dramatic west to east climatic gradients. Our current knowledge of this precipitation distribution is based on weather station data and river discharge measurements, but there is a clear data gap in the high elevation, central Southern Alps. Here, estimates of precipitation strongly diverge. This problem exists because of the difficulties of quantifying the depth and distribution of snow in a remote, high-altitude mountainous region. In order to improve our knowledge of snow distribution within this data-poor region, snow depths of (< 10 m) were assessed parallel to the prevailing westerly wind direction at five locations across the mountain range, between the névé of Franz Josef Glacier, Waiho catchment, to the west and Jollie Valley, Pukaki catchment, in the east. The geophysical method of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used because of its ability to image the deep snow packs experienced in the study region. Comparison of measurement techniques over the (< 3 km) surveyed transects showed that ground-based GPR gave the best sample size (41000 samples) and accuracy due to the high spatial resolution. Airborne GPR (8571 samples) overestimated snow depth by 8 % in low-gradient homogenous terrain, and 24 % in steep heterogeneous terrain. The difference is ascribed to the larger view area of the GPR in the airborne survey. Direct probing of snow depth also performed poorly in comparison to ground-based GPR when generalising snow distribution over an area. Across-mountain precipitation peaked ~ 5 km west of the main divide, between 1700 and 2000 m a. s. l, providing the first empirical support to existing estimates of the location of peak precipitation. Results show decreasing precipitation from 12 ma- 1 at Franz Josef Glacier, in the Waiho catchment, to 1. 8 ma- 1 at Jollie River valley, in the Lake Pukaki catchment, 25 km to the south-east. Internal reflection horizons in snow-pack radargrams allowed snowfall events to be tracked, and a relationship lowland and <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> to be established. Snowfall accumulation 'factors' were derived for different atmospheric circulation indices, and these will enable improved accuracy in modelling of snow accumulation processes.

Mixed-phase clouds, or those in which liquid droplets, ice particle and water vapor co-exist, are of particular importance in the Southern Rockies of the United States, where these clouds enhance wintertime <b>mountain</b> <b>precipitation</b> mass and annual water storage in the snowpack. The interaction between multiple water phases within a cloud presents challenges for in situ observation. I describe the existing in situ cloud microphysical instrumentation, and introduce a new instrument for the in situ measurement of total water concentration: the second-generation University of Colorado closed-path tunable-diode laser hygrometer (CLH- 2). This compact instrument can be flown within a scientific aircraft under-wing canister and is designed for operation in diverse environmental conditions. During the winter 2010 - 2011, the CLH- 2 was installed on a wind vane at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) in the Park Range of Colorado {{as a part of the}} Storm Peak Laboratory Cloud Property Validation Experiment (StormVEx) campaign. I apply a new method for determining the bulk mass-dimensional relationship of ice particles from ground-based observations. Despite important difference between airborne and ground-based particle measurements, my parameterization yields particle masses close to those from recent airborne studies that take into account the effect of ice particle shattering on observed number concentrations. Variations in particle density over the course of a storm are suggested by time variations between the observed and parameterized ice water concentrations. Using observations from the Wyoming King Air research aircraft collected during the Colorado Airborne Multi-Phase Cloud Study (CAMPS) in winter 2010 - 2011, cloud water phase is identified using in situ microphysical measurements. While mixed-phase clouds are identified throughout the study area, the fraction of clouds found to be mixed-phase increases amid a region of mean upward vertical air motion that extends 25 km windward of the ridge axis. Near the ridge axis, collocated increases are observed in the CLH observed cloud water concentration and in the number concentration of both cloud-droplet- sized and larger particles. The abundance of mixed-phase clouds decreases sharply in the lee of the ridge, suggesting rapid glaciation or evaporation in the absence of the windward updrafts.

An {{example of this is}} the Patagonian Desert in Argentina bounded by the Andes to its west. In the case of Central Asia, <b>mountains</b> restrict <b>precipitation</b> from the monsoon. The Kyzyl Kum, Taklamakan and Katpana Desert deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates. The Ladakh region, and Leh city in the Great Himalayas in India, also has a cold desert climate. This is also found in Europe, primarily in Bardenas Reales near Tudela, Navarre and high altitude parts of the Tabernas Desert in Almería, Spain and the Karagiye Depression in Aktau, Kazakhstan ...|$|R
