40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of fractional composition of seed material on productive properties of spring rape seeds of the ‘Magnat’ variety and ‘MVM’ (‘Gladiator’) variety sample. Methods. Field investigations, laboratory tests, statistical analysis. Results. During 2013 – 2014, the influence <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> different size fractions (up to 2, 5  g; 2, 6 – 3, 5  g; 3, 6  g and more) on the indices of productivity of spring rape varie­ties was studied. It was found {{that over the years}} of study field germination <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> fractions <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in ‘Magnat’ variety averaged 83. 5 %, in ‘MSM’ variety sample – 86. 7 %. During the periods of seedling emergence and harvesting, the density of spring rape crops varied depending on relevant fraction <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> <b>seeds.</b> In the ‘Magnat’ variety, photosynthetic potential of crops ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 3 million m 2 /ha, in ‘MSM’ variety sample – from 1. 2 to 1. 6 million m 2 /ha. Depending on the seed fractions applied, ‘Magnat’ variety crops during the gro­wing season accumulated organic biomass from 2. 05 to 2. 36 g/m 2 per day, ‘MSM’ sample variety – from 1. 83 to 2. 10 g/m 2 per day. Conclusions. It was established that different fractions <b>of</b> spring rape <b>seeds</b> <b>sown</b> in the Northern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine affected the indices of germinating energy and laboratory germination, crop density formation, leaf surface area and intensity of photosynthesis process (crop photosynthetic potential, net photosynthesis performance).

The influence of Langston Hughes’ poem ‘Dream Deferred’ is very obvious in both these stalwarts, Dr. Kingand Hansberry. It is from this poem Lorraine Hansberry also took the title for her play, A Raisin in the Sun from Hughes’ poem.

40|$|Question: Restoration of {{channelized}} streams increases geomorphic complexity but {{it remains}} unclear how this interacts with processes that drive future vegetation changes (dispersal, germination and establishment). This study asks if increased geomorphic complexity increases recruitment conditions <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> <b>seeds</b> or affects post-dispersal natural seedling densities. Location: Vindel River catchment, northern Sweden. Methods: We selected seven study streams with paired reaches that differed in {{the degree to which}} geomorphic complexity was restored. Basic reaches used simple restoration methods while enhanced reaches additionally added large boulders and woody debris. We <b>sowed</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> six species at ten locations in each reach in 2014 and counted the number of seedlings after 8 wk and the number of naturally occurring seedlings in a plot adjacent to the sowing locations in 2013 and 2014. Using factor analysis based on 34 complexity measurements, overall geomorphic complexity was quantified for eight of the 14 reaches. Results: Total numbers <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> (2014) and natural seedlings (2013 and 2014) summed per reach did not differ between restoration types when tested pair-wise. Enhanced restoration did not always significantly increase geomorphic complexity, which differed considerably between the streams. More complex reaches were steeper, had larger size sediment and more nutrient-poor soils. Total recruitment <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> species significantly decreased with increasing complexity. Numbers of natural seedlings differed considerably from 2013 to 2014, but were not related to complexity. In 2014, a potential parent plant of the same species occurred within the same plot for 71. 8 % of the natural seedlings that could be identified. Conclusions: The recruitment <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> <b>seeds</b> was affected by overall geomorphic complexity rather than by the enhanced restoration. The absence of a correlation between geomorphic complexity and natural seedlings could indicate that natural seedling dynamics are not solely determined by recruitment conditions, but also by dispersal...|$|R

40|$|Questions: Can seed {{addition}} {{enhance the}} success of establishing species-rich grassland on former arable land? Are sowing date and cutting regime important in determining success? Location: Aberdeen and Elgin, northeast Scotland, United Kingdom. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at two sites to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> addition, <b>sowing</b> date and cutting regime on the vegetation developing on former arable land, the aim being to compare {{the success of}} different treatments at producing a species-rich grassland. Results: <b>Sowing</b> a <b>seed</b> mix resulted {{in the establishment of}} vegetation very distinct from the species-poor vegetation dominated by perennial grasses which otherwise developed, though establishment success <b>of</b> the <b>sown</b> grassland species was highly variable between sites. Where establishment <b>of</b> the <b>sown</b> species was poor, sowing date had no significant effect on species composition, whereas the cutting regime was very important. Cutting the vegetation significantly increased both the number and abundance <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> species compared with the uncut control. Conversely, where establishment had been good, the cutting regime in the first year had little effect on species composition. Cutting the vegetation at least twice a year appeared to be the most effective management over the length of the experiment. Conclusions: <b>Sowing</b> a <b>seed</b> mixture significantly reduced the abundance and number of naturally colonising species, effectively controlling problem weed species such as Senecio jacobaea and Cirsium vulgare, highlighting the agronomic value <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> <b>seed</b> mixtures on fallow farmland.

A field experiment was carried out in the years 2011 – 2013 in a randomized split-plot design with four replications. The first factor was a pea ‘Wiato’ or ‘Tarchalska’. The secondary factor was density of a pea mixture sown: 40, 60, and 80 %. The yield of mixture seeds as well as the yield and structure of individual components were evaluated. The contents of crude protein and crude fiber, fat, ash, phosphorus, and potassium were determined in cereal grain and pea seeds. 			 			The examined factors and weather conditions during the growing season had a significant impact on the growth and yield of pea–spring wheat mixtures. The seed yields of the mixtures with the semi-leafless ‘Tarchalska’ were lower than with ‘Wiato’ (with bipinnate leaves). Increasing the pea percentage in seed material resulted in lower mixture yields. The percentage of pea seeds (regardless of foliage type) in the mixture yields was significantly lower than the weight <b>of</b> <b>sown</b> <b>seeds.</b> Increasing the pea percentage in the mixture yield positively influenced the contents of protein, fat, and ash but it caused a decrease in the content of fiber. The pea percentage at sowing had little influence on the content of phosphorus in the mixture seed yields, but it slightly increased the content of potassium, regardless of the pea cultivar. The mixtures with the ‘Wiato’ and ‘Tarchalska’ cultivars contained a similar amount of protein, fiber, and fat, while the mixtures with ‘Tarchalska’ accumulated more ash...|$|R
