5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed to turning the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and {{the perils of}} the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> others.|$|E

25|$|The {{strike is}} {{described}} in detail, with intelligent leaders like Higgins, the desperate violence and savagery of the rioters and the reactions of both sides (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 17). Through the eyes of Margaret (a horrified, compassionate outsider), Gaskell illustrates the social <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the slums Margaret visits, misery occasionally documented in parliamentary papers (blue books) with suggestive illustrations {{which resulted in the}} Factory Act of 1833.|$|E
25|$|Charles, to the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the French peasantry, {{began to}} raise {{additional}} {{funds to pay}} for the ransom of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, King Edward assembled his army at Calais in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against Rheims. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, Paris, Edward moved his army to Chartres. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.|$|E
25|$|Another early {{example of}} a cryptic {{depiction}} is in Bertolt Brecht's 1941 play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in which Hitler, in the persona of the principal character Arturo Ui, a Chicago racketeer in the cauliflower trade, is ruthlessly satirised. Brecht, who was German but left when the Nazis came to power, also expressed {{his opposition to the}} National Socialist and Fascist movements in other plays such as Mother Courage and Fear and <b>Misery</b> <b>of</b> the Third Reich.|$|E

25|$|Calvin's Geneva {{became the}} model for all {{continental}} Reformed worship, {{and by the end}} of the sixteenth century a fixed liturgy was being used by all Reformed churches. Dutch Reformed churches developed an order of worship in refugee churches in England and Germany which was ratified at synods in Dordrecht in 1574 and 1578. The form emphasizes self-examination between the words of institution and communion consisting of accepting the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> one's sin, assurance of mercy, and turning away those who are unrepentant.|$|E
25|$|Before {{his rise}} to power, Francisco Franco was posted to Tenerife in March 1936 by a Republican {{government}} wary of his influence and political leanings. However, Franco received information and in Gran Canaria agreed to collaborate {{in the military}} coup {{that would result in}} the Spanish Civil War; the Canaries fell to the Nationalists in July 1936. In the 1950s, the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the post-war years caused thousands of the island's inhabitants to emigrate to Cuba and other parts of Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Howard W. Campbell, Jr.: An American Nazi. Before the war, {{he lived}} in Germany {{where he was a}} noted German-language playwright and Nazi propagandist.

Edgar Derby confronts him when Campbell tries to recruit American POWs into the American Free Corps to fight the Communist Soviet Union on behalf of the Nazis. Campbell is the protagonist of an earlier Vonnegut novel, Mother Night.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E
25|$|This {{case against}} the Wests would {{collapse}} when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister declined to testify at the court case on 7 June 1993, with the child rape victim expressing her desire {{to return to her}} family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement both because of her noting the <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose's vindictiveness. Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.|$|E

A post-credits scene shows Homura seated in a chair while watching over Mitakihara City and a badly-beaten Kyubey in the vicinity. After staring into the horizon, Homura leans over and falls off a cliff.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch and English {{army had}} access to a large {{quantity}} of artillery, which had landed via barges landed from the Rhine. On 11 August 1597 approaches were dug towards the city's walls as the siege commenced. William Louis of Nassau was wounded by {{a bullet in the}} thigh and Maurice not long after had a cannonball fly just over his head as it entered his tent while in repose.

25|$|Already {{demoralized}} {{by having}} to retreat, the Allied soldiers were soon forced to survive on acorns when the inept Quartermaster General James Willoughby Gordon directed the supply trains onto the wrong road. On 17 November, Gordon sent the cavalry rear guard off to a flank {{and for a time}} the retreating infantry were directly exposed to the attentions of the French cavalry. On this day, Wellington's second-in-command Edward Paget was made a prisoner by the French horsemen. The <b>misery</b> <b>of</b> the hungry foot soldiers was intense as they struggled to march on muddy roads in the cold weather.|$|E
