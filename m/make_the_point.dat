5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to {{see the need for}} women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{community}} established {{many of the}} institutions that characterize a durable society, and indeed came to dominate an entire section of Munich, the overriding imperative was to find new homes for the refugees. To <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> many of the leaders emigrated at the first possible opportunity. Both overt lobbying efforts and underground migration sought to open for unrestricted immigration to Palestine. And the camps largely emptied once the state of Israel was established, many of the refugees immediately joining the newly formed Israel Defense Forces to fight the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1992, President Aquino {{formally}} and peacefully {{handed over}} power to her anointed candidate and democratically elected General Fidel Ramos, {{after six years}} of hard-fought democratic transition and restoration. After the inauguration of the new President, Aquino chose to leave by riding in a simple white Toyota Crown she had purchased, rather than the lavish government-issued Mercedes Benz which she and Ramos had ridden in {{on the way to the}} ceremonies, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that she was once again an ordinary citizen.|$|E

25|$|Special {{calibrated}} strobe lights, {{capable of}} flashing up {{to hundreds of}} times per second, are used in industry to stop the appearance of motion of rotating and other repetitively operating machinery and to measure, or adjust, the rotation speeds or cycle times. Since this stop is only apparent, a marked point on the rotating body will either appear to move backward or forward, or not move, depending on {{the frequency of the}} strobe-flash. If the flash occurs equal to the period of rotation (or evenly multiplied, i.e. 2*π*n/ω, where n is an integer and ω the angular frequency) the marked point will appear to not move. Any non integer flash setting will make the mark appear to move forward or backward, e.g. a slight increase of the flash frequency will <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> appear to move backward.|$|E
25|$|The {{armament}} of the Phalangites {{is described}} in the Military Decree of Amphipolis. It lists the fines imposed upon the soldiers who fail to maintain their armament or produce it upon demand. Offensive weapons were a pike (sarissa), and a short sword (machaira). The sarissa was over 6m (18ft) in length, with a counterweight and spiked end at the rear called a sauroter; {{it seems to have}} had an iron sleeve in the middle which may mean that it was in two pieces for the march with the sleeve joining the two sections before use. Like the xyston, the sarissa was greatly tapered towards the point. This, along with the sauroter, helped to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of balance as far towards the butt of the weapon as possible. It should be stressed that the archaeological discoveries show that the phalangites also used the two-edged sword (xiphos) as well as the traditional Greek hoplite spear (doru/δόρυ), which was much shorter than the sarissa. The sources also indicate that the phalangites were on occasion armed with javelins. The sarissa would have been useless in siege warfare and other combat situations requiring a less cumbersome weapon.|$|E

500|$|The exact point made by Zhuangzi in {{this debate}} is not entirely clear. [...] The story seems to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that [...] "knowing" [...] a thing is simply a state of mind, {{and that it is}} not {{possible}} to determine if that knowing has any objective validity. [...] This story has been cited as an example of Zhuangzi's linguistic mastery, as he subtly uses reason to make an anti-rationalist point.|$|E
500|$|With the Sumter issue unresolved, Seward sent Lincoln a {{memorandum}} on April 1, proposing various courses of action, including possibly declaring war on France and Spain if certain conditions were not met, and reinforcing the forts along the Gulf of Mexico. In any event, vigorous policies were needed {{and the president}} must either establish them himself or allow a Cabinet member to, with Seward making it clear {{he was willing to}} do it. Lincoln drafted a reply indicating that whatever policy was adopted, [...] "I must do it", though he never sent it, but met with Seward instead, and what passed between them is not known. Seward's biographers <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the note was sent to a Lincoln who had not yet proved himself in office.|$|E

500|$|Kolbe's {{recognition}} as a Christian martyr also created some controversy within the Catholic Church. While his ultimate self-sacrifice of his life was most certainly considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed strictly speaking out of odium fidei (hatred of the faith), but {{as the result of}} an act of Christian charity. Pope Paul VI himself had recognized this distinction at his beatification by naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title [...] "martyr of charity". Pope John Paul II, however, when deciding to canonize him, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity), wishing to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the systematic hatred of (whole categories of) humanity propagated by the Nazi regime was in itself inherently an act of hatred of religious (Christian) faith, meaning Kolbe's death equated to martyrdom.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I can't {{recommend}} it enough", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, [...] "They <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen." [...] Amy Duncan of Metro said it [...] "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said [...] "develops with [...] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode [...] "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story {{in addition to the}} throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't [...] "pull any punches". Zaino said the episode has [...] "a wonderful sense of the absurd", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word 'Censored' scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E

500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E
