Then I thought, 'Twenty-five per cent of the world might get this, {{probably}} less, it's not worth it.' It happens all the time, because my references are usually off the Richter scale." ...|$|E
500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> got off that train, I knew what she was trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E

500|$|Ahead of Challinor's {{first season}} as a Football League player, he {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "It's {{been a long time coming}} so I'm going to embrace it and enjoy every <b>minute.</b> <b>I</b> think almost every team I have played for has gone on to reach the League so to finally achieve it is a dream come true but it doesn't end there". He made his first {{appearance}} as a League player in a League Cup first round match away to Doncaster Rovers on 11 August 2012 as an 87th-minute substitute for McLaughlin. York lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 extra time draw, although Challinor was successful in converting his penalty. He finished 2012–13 with 22 appearances before being released by York on 30 April 2013.|$|E

Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a continued fraction. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems. [...] Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note.

500|$|He {{restored}} the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, {{his home in}} Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including [...] "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the [...] garden. Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, {{the fact that he did}} it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E
500|$|On November 8, 2011, a {{demo version}} of the song, named [...] "Give Me All Your Love", was leaked. According to Keith Caulfield from Billboard, [...] "Within a few hours, [...] was among {{one of the top}} 10 {{trending}} topics worldwide on Twitter." [...] Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, addressed the leak on Twitter adding the singer's statement on the situation: [...] "My true fans wouldn't do this". Oseary also clarified that their initial plan was for new music to come out in 2012 itself. He was happy with the positive reaction to the demo, but asked fans to help him police any more leaks. The leaked demo lacked vocals from both Minaj and M.I.A. which Madonna reflected upon, [...] "It's really disappointing because you don't want things to come out till you're done with them, till you're ready. It's like everybody looking at your unfinished painting. It's like, 'Wait a <b>minute.</b> <b>I</b> didn't finish that. That's not fair." ...|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money." ...|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do", Strickland said.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just {{to get an idea}} what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez and his team of engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. He was sure of doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally goes in and snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound and squeezes it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E
500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E

The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life.
