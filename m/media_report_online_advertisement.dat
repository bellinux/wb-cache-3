The study is based on quantitative research interviews with young people (15 - 17 years) and qualitative interviews with people in the same age group as well as teachers and international media professionals. This study's theoretical point of departure is McQuail´s observation that peoples' values and views to a great extent are influenced by the media. Another source of theoretical inspiration was Haberman's ideas about how a diversity of views and arguments increase the citizens' ability to reflect critically on social developments - maybe even more so than in societies with  independent media and "neutral" news. The study shows that the young generation of web based news consumers assumes that it is very important to be an aware and critical consumer but also that they do not feel sufficiently equipped with the right tools required to understand the long-term impact and effect of the <b>media</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>online.</b> Young people basically seemed to acquire their knowledge about media by doing and learning on their own.

Physician surveys conducted in various countries invariably report that placebos are routinely used clinically, impure placebos more frequently than the pure ones, and that physicians consider them to be of legitimate therapeutic value. Inconsistent study methodologies and physician conceptualisations of placebos may complicate the interpretation of survey data, but hardly negate the valuable insights these research findings provide. Because impure placebos are often not recognised as such by practitioners, they remain at the fringe of many placebo-related debates, hence quietly absent from discussions concerning policy and regulation.

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to classify the types of information in online advertising that Internet users prefer and to examine whether different forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> cause disturbance in information searching prior to product purchases. The data were gathered by conducting surveys to college students in three universities in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung in Taiwan. The total valid samples were 283, out of 300 surveyed respondents. The mobile phone is used in this study as objects due to the familiarities of the products to college students and abundance of information provided online. The informativeness of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> including dimensions of price/promotion, service, design, and function are what respondents intend to view. Due to the characteristics of the Internet, advertisers are able to utilize animated, colored, and interactive advertisements on Websites to draw attention of users. The concern is that certain advertisements disturb what users are currently doing online. This study intends to examine the reactions to different forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> and to reveal whether respondents express feelings of annoyance for certain forms of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> during information searching activities. Subsequent behavior of the respondents after verifying whether they are annoyed upon viewing certain types of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> is examined. Respondents are categorized into two clusters, ad-neutral and ad-annoyed, using variables measuring annoyance of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> while searching information of mobile phones. For respondents in the ad-neutral cluster, price/promotion and service are factors valued more importantly while viewing information in <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> On the contrary, for respondents in the ad-annoyed cluster, design and function are more important factors than price/promotion and service in terms of information upon seeing <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Nearly all kinds of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> cause annoyance to a certain level. For those young adults who do not have reactions of being disturbed by <b>online</b> <b>advertisements,</b> they tend to have subsequent behavior of ignoring the <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> These results indicate Internet users are aware of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> and understand the disturbance caused by <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> is unavoidable. In sum, if marketers or advertisers intend to design <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> that do not cause too much annoyance to the majority of Internet users, the banners or interstitials should be ideal. Certain types of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> like pop-ups and mouse-tailing need to be used with caution. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance can be tolerated, the information searching behavior goes on. When Internet users are disturbed and the annoyance cannot be tolerated, the information searching behavior is terminated. The effort of designing <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> ended up with users' ignorance or termination can be wasted and useless. Marketers and advertisers not only try to attract attentions of <b>online</b> users with <b>advertisements,</b> but also need to restrict the annoyance or disturbance of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> to an acceptable level to reduce the opportunities of being ignored or terminated.

The present study empirically tested Triandis and Gelfand's (1998) four dimensional cultural theory, and evaluate the usage of standardization advertising strategies. The method used was content analysis. Product-based corporate webpage of 200 car models were subjected to the analysis. By dividing the 200 webpages into four groups, namely domestic Chinese webpage, international webpage in the Chinese market, domestic American webpage, and international webpage in the US market, the present study access the standardization degree of international webpage against its respective domestic webpage. The result shows that cultural differences moderately affect ad appeals to values and information content in <b>online</b> <b>advertisement,</b> to the direction as the four-dimensional cultural theory predicts. Chinese <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> uses more international appeals, and appeals to harmony and benevolence. American <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> is more informative than Chinese <b>online</b> <b>advertisement.</b> The effect of cultural difference on emotional appeals is not significant because of the universality of basic emotions. As predicted, since <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> is more cost-efficient than traditional media, American <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> is highly localized. The results also support the contingent standardization theory. A combination of standardized strategies and localized strategies are used in international <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> in the Chinese market...|$|R
40|$|Extending and {{combining}} concepts from {{consumer surplus}} of product availability and personalization strategies under privacy concern {{we made a}} model to comprehend and justify {{the reasons for the}} increase in the spending on <b>online</b> <b>advertisements.</b> We inductively found that with higher capability to sell increased product variety online and with high consumer utility from personalized services, investment in <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> will rise with a greater exponential slope and reach the saturation point much later than with lower levels of consumer utility and product variety. First, we linked <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> with technology adoption, by using decision-theoretic model to understand the probabilistic outcomes of when a firm decides to wait and observe and when it decides to adopt. Then we tried to comprehend the implications of consumer utility through personalized services and the compensating variance through increased product variety. Considering, that Internet adoption like most technology adoption will follow an S-curve we inductively concluded, along with attached evidences, that spending in <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> will follow the same path. The slope, inflection point and the saturation point of the curve will depend on the ability to increase consumer utility through personalization and the consumer variance with increased product variety. Combining the concepts we also stated that a firm is more likely to adopt <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> as a media for marketing if these two features are optimized.

40|$|Advertising is {{commonly}} used to foster sales and reputation of an institution. It is at first the growth of print advertising that has increased the population and number of periodicals of newspaper and its circulation. The rise of Internet and online media has somehow blurred the role of media and advertising though the intention is still {{to reach out to}} audience and to increase sales. The relationship between advertising and audience on a product purchase through persuasion has been developing from print media to online media. From the changing media environment and audience, it is the concern of this research to study the impact of online advertising to such a relationship cycle. The content of <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> is much of text, multimedia, photo, audio and video. The messages of such content format may indeed bring impacts to its audience and its credibility. This study is therefore reflecting the effectiveness of <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> and its influences on generation Y in their purchasing behavior. This study uses Media Dependency Theory to analyze the relationship between the impact of <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> and media usage pattern of generation Y. Hierarchy of Effectiveness Model is used as a marketing communication model to study the effectiveness of advertising and further to determine the impact of <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> on generation Y in their purchasing decision making. This research uses online survey to reach out the sample of generation Y. The results have shown that <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> do not affect much on purchase decision making even though generation Y relies much on the media content including <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> for its information and believing in its credibility.

Popular <b>online</b> classified <b>advertisement</b> sites such as Craigslist, Ebay Classifieds, and Oodle have attracted a huge number of posts and visits. Due to its high commercial potential, the <b>online</b> classified <b>advertisement</b> domain is a target for spammers, and this has become one of the biggest issues hindering further development of <b>online</b> <b>advertisement.</b> Therefore, spam detection in <b>online</b> <b>advertisement</b> is a crucial problem. However, previous approaches for Web spam detection in other domains do not work well in the advertisement domain. We propose a novel spam detection approach that takes into account the particular characteristics of this domain. Specifically, we propose a novel set of features that could strongly discriminate between spam and legitimate advertisement posts. Our experiments on a dataset derived from Craigslist advertisements demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, the approach provides improvements of 55 % in terms of F- 1 score over a baseline that uses traditional features alone...|$|R

In contrast to traditional advertising, <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> establish an interactive communication. Now-a-days, teenagers are frequently using the internet either for educational purposes or at least for entertainment. When the teenagers come across these <b>online</b> <b>advertisements,</b> their attitude about the advertisements {{is very important for}} the success of the advertisements. Hence, the present study analyses the overall attitude of teenagers about <b>online</b> <b>advertisements</b> based on gender, educational qualifications and age. To capture the responses from the teenagers being respondents of the study, a well-structured questionnaire was administered to 2500 respondents with a yielding rate of 80. 04 % (2001 usable Questionnaires). The various factors such as general perception, advertising utility, indignity, price perceptions and regulation were captured on a five point scale and further classified into three groups namely favorable, neutral and unfavorable based on the total score.
