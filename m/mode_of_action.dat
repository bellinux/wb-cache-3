5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E

5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

40|$|Under REACH, the European Community Regulation on chemicals, {{the testing}} {{strategy}} for carcinogenicity {{is based on}} in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. Given that non-genotoxic carcinogens are negative for genotoxicity and chronic bioassays are no longer regularly performed, this class of carcinogens will go undetected. Therefore, test systems detecting non-genotoxic carcinogens, or even better their <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> are required. Here, we investigated whether gene expression profiling in primary hepatocytes {{can be used to}} distinguish different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> non-genotoxic carcinogens. For this, primary mouse hepatocytes were exposed to 16 non-genotoxic carcinogens with diverse <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Upon profiling, pathway analysis was performed to obtain insight into the biological relevance of the observed changes in gene expression. Subsequently, both a supervised and an unsupervised comparison approach were applied to recognize the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> at the transcriptomic level. These analyses resulted in the detection of three of eight compound classes, that is, peroxisome proliferators, metalloids and skin tumor promotors. In conclusion, gene expression profiles in primary hepatocytes, at least in rodent hepatocytes, appear to be useful to detect some, certainly not all, <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> non-genotoxic carcinogens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractModern {{medicine}} {{faces the}} challenge of developing safer and more effective therapies to treat human diseases. Many drugs currently in use were discovered without knowledge of their underlying molecular mechanisms. Understanding their biological targets and <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> will be essential to design improved second-generation compounds. Here, we describe {{the use of a}} genome-wide pool of tagged heterozygotes to assess the cellular effects of 78 compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, lanosterol synthase in the sterol biosynthetic pathway was identified as a target of the antianginal drug molsidomine, which may explain its cholesterol-lowering effects. Further, the rRNA processing exosome was identified as a potential target of the cell growth inhibitor 5 -fluorouracil.

30|$|The holistic, multi-pronged <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{employed}} by biopesticides {{may have the}} additional benefit of delaying the development of pest resistance. Resistance to chemical pest control measures has been a challenge for decades (reviewed in Chandler et al. and Hollomon [67],[68]). The use of synthetic pesticides with different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is one tool for dealing with this problem [68]. While resistance to biopesticides remains relatively unstudied to date due to an infrequent occurrence, {{it could be a}} productive area for future research. Even when or if pests develop resistance to biopesticides, the fact that many biopesticides draw on <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> distinct from synthetic pesticides (reviewed in the case of bioherbicides by Duke and Dayan [69]) would facilitate their use in integrated pest management in conjunction with synthetic pesticides.|$|R
