As a consequence and in spite of the unparalleled hazards associated with ionizing radiation, this new nuclear industry is growing rapidly into a benevolent giant bringing a better way of life while at the Same time maintaining radiation damage at an insignificant level. Although i n the past few decades we have learned much more about the hazards associated with ionizing radiation than those associated with some of the common industrial hazards and although maximum permissible exposure levels for the radionuclides have been established with greater reliability and confidence than have the levels for many chemical agents with which man has been familiar for many centuries, there still remains a considerable uncertainty in many of the basic assumptions and in the parameters used in the calculation of <b>maximum</b> permissible <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> and <b>maximum</b> permissible concentration of the various radionuclides in food, water and air.

A subset of this class of compounds produce similar spectra of toxicity in experimental animals as does 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and these chemicals have been classified as "dioxins. " In this study, we compared the <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of dioxins that produce effects in experimental animals to <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> associated with these effects in humans. Human <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were estimated from lipid-adjusted serum concentrations of dioxins, assuming dioxins are equally distributed in body fat and an adult has 22 % body fat. The toxic equivalency factor (TEF) method was used to calculate <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of dioxins in humans. These calculations included dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls.

Significant individual differences in metal <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were found in C. nobilis.

Epidemiological studies have observed diverging associations between halogenated persistent organic pollutant (POP) exposure and concentrations of THs in pregnant women and their infants. We investigated whether background exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is related to TH status in a Swedish population of pregnant women and their infants. Furthermore, we examined associations between polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and TH status in early pregnancy as an extension of an earlier study focusing on late pregnancy TH status. Methods: Free thyroxine (T 4), total triiodo-thyronine (T 3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were analysed in serum from first-time mothers (N = 220 - 281) in the first and third trimester, and in infants (N = 115 - 150) 3 weeks and 3 months after delivery. Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) (N = 260) were measured in maternal third trimester serum. Maternal <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of PCBs (N = 281) were estimated from serum lipid PCB concentrations in late pregnancy, and PCDD/F (N = 97) and PBDE (N = 186) <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were estimated from concentrations in mother's milk lipids 3 weeks after delivery. Linear regression models allowed for covariate adjustment of the associations between ln-transformed POP <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> and concentrations of TH and anti-TPO. Results: Maternal <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of BDE- 153 was inversely associated with first trimester total T 3, otherwise no associations between PBDEs and first and second trimester THs were observed.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} {{presented}} for developing {{water quality criteria}} (WQC) for type I narcotic chemicals in general and PAHs in particular. The criteria {{can be applied to}} any individual or mixture of narcotic chemicals using only the chemical’s octanol-water partition coefficient KOW. It is derived from a database of LC 50 s comprising 156 chemicals and 33 species, including fish, amphibians, arthropods, mollusks, polychaetes, coelenterates, and protozoans. A target lipid model is proposed that accounts for variations in toxicity due to differing species sensitivities and chemical differences. The model is {{based on the idea that}} a target lipid is the site of action in the organism. Further, it is assumed that target lipid has the same lipid-octanol linear free energy relationship for all species. This implies that the slope of the log(LC 50) –log(KOW) relationship is the same for all species. However, individual species may have varying target lipid <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> that cause toxicity. The target lipid LC 50 <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> derived from concentration data in the water only are compared to measured total lipid LC 50 <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> for five species. They are essentially equal, indicating that the target lipid concentration is equal to the total extracted lipid concentration. The precise relationship between partitioning in target lipid and octanol is established. The species-specific <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> are used to determine the WQC final acute value, i. e., the 95 -percentile level of protection. An acute-to-chronic ratio is used to compute the <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> corresponding to the WQC final chronic value, which is the procedure used to derive the U. S.
