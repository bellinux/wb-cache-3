40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{distributed}} {{source coding}} rarely considers the possible link between separate encoders. However, the broadcast nature of wireless communication in sensor networks provides a free gossip mechanism {{which can be}} used to simplify encoding/decoding and reduce transmission power. Using this broadcast advantage, we present a new two-encoder scheme which imitates the ping-pong game and has a successive approximation structure. For the quadratic Gaussian case, we prove that this scheme is successively refinable on the {sumrate, distortion pair} surface, which is characterized by the ratedistortion region of the distributed two-encoder source coding. A potential energy saving over conventional distributed coding is also illustrated. This ping-pong distributed coding idea can be extended to the <b>multiple</b> <b>encoder</b> case and provides the theoretical foundation for a new class of distributed image coding method in wireless scenarios.

40|$|The {{encoding}} {{of multiple}} video programs is analysed when optimizing rate, distortion, and complexity jointly. It {{is assumed that}} the processing platform allows allocating the processing resources dynamically between the encoders, such as e. g. possible when <b>multiple</b> <b>encoder</b> instances run on a multi-core processor. The goal is to allocate processing resources to the program which currently benefits most from it. For this purpose, the complexity-distortion trade-off is evaluated for each Group of Picture (GOP) and resources are allocated dynamically on a GOP time frame. Besides dynamic allocation of processing resources we also consider the dynamic allocation of bit rate under consideration of the rate-distortion trade-off. The analysis of the potential gain with respect to several system parameters (duration of GOP, processing resources, bit rate) is the topic of this paper. Simulation results are presented for an ensemble of 8 programs encoded with H. 264 /AVC at various bit rates and complexity levels. The simulation results indicate that an average gain of 3. 2 dB PSNR can be achieved {{where most of the}} gain can be attributed to rate-distortion optimization rather than complexity distortion optimization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} the performance {{evaluation of a}} space-time turbo processing system employing a combined turbo coded and antenna transmission diversity scheme for DS/CDMA communication systems. In this combined coding/signalling scenario the turbo coder structure is exploited for a novel space-time processing approach. The binary input data to a rate � <b>multiple</b> turbo <b>encoder</b> produces coded bits, which, in turn, are assigned through suitable puncturing patterns to different antennae and transmitted from each antenna simultaneously. The novelty of the transmission scheme, is that the original single-antenna rate-� turbo coded system {{is transformed into a}} more powerful rate- � turbo code.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{selective}} MV-MDC (Multiple Description Coding of Motion Vector) scheme {{with the data}} partitioning in the H. 264 /AVC standard. The proposed MD (<b>Multiple</b> Description) <b>encoder</b> separates the MV (Motion Vector) into two parts of equal priority {{each of which is}} transmitted through an independent packet. Additionally, {{to reduce the size of}} bitstream, the proposed MD encoder decides either MD or normal mode by using a loss-aware MD mode selection process. In case of the MD mode, the proposed MD decoding scheme utilizes two matching criteria to find an accurate MV when one of the MV descriptions is lost. Simulation results show that compared to simply duplicated bitstream transmission, the proposed MV-MDC scheme reduces a large amount of data without serious visual quality loss of reconstructed picture. 1 Index Terms — Multiple description coding, motion vector, data partitioning, error resilient coding, H. 264 /AVC standard 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the transmission of}} multiple descriptions over noisy channels rather than the on-off channels that are traditionally considered. We introduce the use of iterative decoding techniques {{similar to those used}} in "turbo" decoding to decode multiple correlated descriptions transmitted over a noisy channel. For a given transmission rate per channel and a given channel state, the efficacy of iterative decoding depends on the correlatedness of the two descriptions produced by the <b>multiple</b> description <b>encoder.</b> We demonstrate that there is an optimal amount of redundancy or correlation for a given channel state. Hence, multiple description codes may also be viewed as joint source-channel codes. 1 Introduction Multiple Description Coding (MDC) is a source coding technique which is used to generate multiple (correlated) descriptions of a source. These descriptions are transmitted over independent channels to the receiver. When all descriptions are received, a high-quality reco [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Arithmetic coding is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} upcoming image and video compression standards such as JPEG 2000, and MPEG- 4 /H. 264 AVC and SVC standards. It provides an efficient way of lossless compression and recently, {{it has been used}} for joint compression and encryption of video data. In this paper, we present an interpretation of arithmetic coding using chaotic maps. This interpretation greatly reduces the hardware complexity of decoder to use a single multiplier by using an alternative algorithm and enables encryption of video data at negligible computational cost. The encoding still requires two multiplications. Next, we present a hardware implementation using 64 bit fixed point arithmetic on Virtex- 6 FPGA (with and without using DSP slices). The encoder resources are slightly higher than a traditional AC encoder, but there are savings in decoder performance. The architectures achieve clock frequency of 400 - 500 MHz on Virtex- 6 xc 6 vlx 75 device.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper proposes an {{optimized}} {{version of}} a new absolute linear encoder (ALE). The innovative ALE {{can be used for}} long distance applications (more then 150 m) and the accuracy of the measurements is 0. 5 mm. To obtain these performances the ALE uses a new coding algorithm. This new coding algorithm is the core of the ALE and it allows an economical device solution. The optimized version is able to measure a double distance (more then 300 m) with a better accuracy (0. 25 mm). These performances are obtained using the same device, the same number of sensors and the same ALE structure. The only changes were made in the coding algorithm, in the ruler topology and in the dedicated software. The optimized ALE is a robust device able to work in industrial environment, {{with a high level of}} vibrations. By this reason it is ideal for the transport system control in automating manufacturing processes, intelligent storage spaces, huge archives and libraries Key-Words:- linear absolute <b>encoder,</b> <b>multiple</b> codification, permutation coding, binary coding, linear moto...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} of scalable motion estimation and coding with the structure of multi-layers for 3 D wavelet video coding. The motion representation consists of <b>multiple</b> laycrs. The <b>encoder</b> uses motion of all layers to perform analysis, while the decoder may receive only part of motion for synthesis. Different from other schemes, each layer of motion is a point optimized at a certain range of bit-rate. We observe that the distortion introduced by motion mismatch is highly independent with the rate for tcxture in a wide range. Therefore, {{to make the best}} tradc-off between motion and texture under the constraint of a given bit rate, a motion layer decision algorithm is used to find the appropriate number of motion layers to be included into the bit-stream. The proposed framework also supports the spatial and temporal scalabilitics of motion. Experimental results show significant improvement at low bit-rates and nearly no loss at high bit-rates with layered motion coding and optimal motion decision. The performance is approaching to the convex hull of those with multiple sets of non-scalable motion. 1...|$|R
