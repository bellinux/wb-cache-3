2500|$|Once {{an action}} {{potential}} has {{occurred at a}} patch of membrane, the <b>membrane</b> <b>patch</b> needs time to recover before it can fire again. [...] At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., {{to return to their}} closed state. There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state. Although it limits the frequency of firing, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon. [...] The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon. However, only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. [...] In the usual orthodromic conduction, the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as antidromic conduction—is very rare.

Tympanic <b>membrane</b> <b>patches</b> were fabricated using bovine articular chondrocytes seeded at 50 x 10 cells/mL in 2 % calcium alginate gels.

Conventional intracellular recording involves impaling a cell with a fine electrode; patch-clamp recording takes a different approach. A patch-clamp microelectrode is a micropipette with a relatively large tip diameter. The microelectrode is placed next to a cell, and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw {{a piece of the}} cell membrane (the 'patch') into the microelectrode tip; the glass tip forms a high resistance 'seal' with the cell membrane. This configuration is the [...] "cell-attached" [...] mode, and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane.If more suction is now applied, the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced, leaving the electrode sealed {{to the rest of the}} cell. This [...] "whole-cell" [...] mode allows very stable intracellular recording. A disadvantage (compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode, and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted. A variant of this technique, the [...] "perforated patch" [...] technique, tries to minimise these problems.Instead of applying suction to displace the <b>membrane</b> <b>patch</b> from the electrode tip, it is also possible to make small holes on the patch with pore-forming agents so that large molecules such as proteins can stay inside the cell and ions can pass through the holes freely.

The results show that a conformational change involving the intracellular segment between domains III and IV of the alpha subunit of the sodium channel molecule is required for fast sodium channel inactivation and suggest that this segment may be the fast inactivation gate of the sodium channel...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of membranes is studied {{on the basis}} of a particle-based meshless surface model, which was introduced earlier [Phys. Rev. E 73, 021903 (2006) ]. The model describes fluid membranes with bending energy and-in the case of membranes with boundaries-line tension. The effects of hydrodynamic interactions are investigated by comparing Brownian dynamics with a particle-based mesoscale solvent simulation (multiparticle collision dynamics). Particles self-assemble into vesicles via disk-shaped <b>membrane</b> <b>patches.</b> The time evolution of assembly is found to consist of three steps: particle assembly into discoidal clusters, aggregation of clusters into larger <b>membrane</b> <b>patches,</b> and finally vesicle formation. The time dependence of the cluster distribution and the mean cluster size is evaluated and compared with the predictions of Smoluchowski rate equations. On the other hand, when the line tension is suddenly decreased (or the temperature is increased), vesicles dissolve via pore formation in the membrane. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to speed up the dynamics in both cases. Furthermore, hydrodynamics makes vesicle more spherical in the membrane-closure process...|$|R
