We used a human glioma cell line, Gli- 6, which originated from a biopsy specimen {{of a patient}} with a glioblastoma multiforme. Spheroids of Gli- 6 were prepared by seeding a single cell suspension on agarose-coated Petri dishes. Clonogenic and growth delay assays {{were used to determine}} radio-chemosensitivity of <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> The growth delay assay was used to determine that of Gli- 6 spheroid cultures. Results. Spheroid cultures were found to be more resistant to irradiation with/or without gemcitabine than <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> Whereas gemcitabine significantly enhances the radiation effect of exponentially growing Gli- 6 <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures</b> at minimal cytotoxic concentrations (10 nM, 24 h), no enhancement was seen in confluent <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures</b> and in large spheroids at the same concentration.

Nevertheless, <b>monolayer</b> <b>culture</b> {{is still the}} method of choice for in vitro differentiation of primary osteoblasts. We believe that the delay in mature ECM production by the monolayer cultured osteoblasts is determined by their state of cell maturation. A functional relationship between the inhibition of osteoblast proliferation and the induction of genes associated with matrix maturation was suggested within a <b>monolayer</b> <b>culture</b> model for rat calvarial osteoblasts. We hypothesize, that a pellet culture model could be utilized to decrease initial proliferation and increase the transformation of osteoblasts into a more mature phenotype. We performed pellet cultures using hOBs and compared their differentiation potential to 2 D monolayer cultures. Using the pellet culture model, {{we were able to}} generate a population of cuboidal shaped central osteoblastic cells. Increased proliferation, as seen during low-density <b>monolayer</b> <b>culture,</b> was absent in pellet cultures and monolayers seeded at 40, 000 cells/cm 2. Moreover, the expression pattern of phenotypic markers Runx 2, osterix, osteocalcin, col I and E 11 mRNA was significantly different depending on whether the cells were cultured in low density monolayer, high density monolayer or pellet culture. We conclude that the transformation of the osteoblast phenotype in vitro to a more mature stage can be achieved more rapidly in 3 D culture. Moreover, that dense monolayer leads to the formation of more mature osteoblasts than low-density seeded monolayer, while hOB cells in pellets seem to have transformed even further along the osteoblast phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{application of}} a bioartificial liver (BAL) depends {{on the availability of}} a human cell source with high hepatic functionality, such as the human hepatoma cell line HepaRG. This cell line has demonstrated high hepatic functionality, but the effect of BAL culture on its functionality in time is not known. Therefore, we studied the characteristics of the HepaRG-AMC-BAL over time, and compared the functionality of the HepaRG-AMC-BAL with <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures</b> of HepaRG cells, normalized for protein (bioactive mass) and DNA (cell number). Histological analysis of 14 -day-old BALs demonstrated functional heterogeneity similar to that of <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> Hepatic functionality of the HepaRG-AMC-BALs increased during 2 - 3 weeks of culture. The majority of the measured protein-normalized hepatic functions were already higher in day 14 BAL <b>cultures</b> compared to <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures,</b> including ammonia elimination (3. 2 -fold), urea production (1. 5 -fold), conversion of (15) N-ammonia into (15) N-urea (1. 4 -fold), and cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 activity (7. 9 -fold). Lactate production in <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures</b> switched into lactate consumption in the BAL cultures, a hallmark of primary hepatocytes. When normalized for DNA, only cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 activity was 2. 5 -fold higher in the BAL <b>cultures</b> compared to <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures</b> and lactate production switched to consumption, whereas urea production and (15) N-urea production were 1. 5 - to 2 -fold lower. The different outcomes for protein and DNA normalized functions probably relate to a smaller cell volume of HepaRG cells when cultured in the AMC-BAL. Cell damage was 4 -fold lower in day 14 BAL <b>cultures</b> compared to <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> Transcript levels of cytochrome P 450 1 A 2, 2 B 6, 3 A 4 and 3 A 7 genes and of regulatory genes hepatic nuclear factor 4 α and pregnane X receptor increased in time in BAL cultures and reached higher levels than in <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> Lastly, metabolism of amino acids, particularly the alanine consumption and ornithine production of HepaRG-AMC-BALs more resembled that of primary hepatocytes than <b>monolayer</b> HepaRG <b>cultures.</b> We conclude therefore that BAL culture of HepaRG cells increases its hepatic functionality, particularly when normalized for biomass, both over time, and compared to monolayer, and this is associated with a reduction in cell damage, upregulation of both regulatory and structural hepatic genes, and changes in amino-acid metabolism.

Dedifferentiated cells were pelleted, transferred to a bioreactor and maintained for up to 21 days at 100...|$|E
40|$|Chondrocytes were {{isolated}} from adult laryngeal cartilage by an enzymic procedure that included 6 h digestion with collagenase. The level of 3 SSO 4 * ~ incorporation into cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable material by these cells depended upon the subsequent culturing con-ditions. Suspension cultures incorporated more "SOj'^/cell than <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> Hyalu-ronic acid {{in the medium}} inhibited MSO 4 * ~ incorporation only when the cells were in primary suspension cultures. It {{had no effect on}} <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures,</b> or <b>monolayers</b> organized into nodules, or suspension <b>cultures</b> derived from <b>monolayers.</b> Mild pretreatment with EDTA, however, rendered these susceptible to hyaluronic acid inhibition. In contrast EDTA abolished the inhibitory effect of hyaluronic acid on primary suspension cultures. Oligosaccharides, derived from hyaluronidase digestion of hyaluronic acid that were larger than decasaccharide, had some inhibitory effect on MSO 4 * ~ incorporation by <b>monolayer</b> <b>cultures.</b> The total 36 SO 41 ~ incorporation was less in primary suspension cultures of chondrocytes isolated after 12 h than after 6 h digestion of cartilage and the inhibition by hyaluronic acid was also less. These differences persisted during 12 days of culture. It is suggested that the method of isolating chondrocytes and subsequent culture conditions may modify the cell surface and mask or abolish specific binding sites for hyaluronic acid...|$|R
