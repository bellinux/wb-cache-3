5|$|In either usage, most B movies {{represent}} a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more {{popular in the}} 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.|$|E
5|$|The venom of {{the black}} mamba is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%. The bite of a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 <b>minutes,</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities, and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E
5|$|Thulium-169 is thulium's longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} isotope. It {{is the only}} isotope of thulium that {{is thought to be}} stable, although it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium-165 with a very long half-life. After thulium-169, the next-longest-lived isotopes are thulium-171, which has a half-life of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> Thirty-five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected. Most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta-plus decay, although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission. Heavier isotopes undergo beta-minus decay.|$|E

5|$|At Unbreakable, the TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Three Way match by then-champion Christopher Daniels against A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Styles won {{the match}} {{and the title}} at the event. This led to TNA {{promoting}} a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match between Styles and Daniels for the title at Bound for Glory. This was a rematch between the two that took place at Against All Odds. Other events that lead to this match included the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, which caused the Three Way match at Unbreakable, and Daniels defeating Styles in an Ultimate X Challenge match at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March13 to become champion. On the October8 episode of Impact!, Daniels issued a challenge to Styles to pick three wrestlers on the roster and he would defeat {{all of them in}} fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> Styles accepted the challenge and chose Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and himself. Daniels defeated both Shark Boy and Dutt before the time-limit expired, but did not defeat Styles in time on the October15 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
5|$|To ensure {{constant}} air support, Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) and Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) in {{the shape}} of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, were ordered to achieve a frantic pace in servicing and preparing aircraft for their next mission. To keep a constant aerial vigil over the task force, the 'black men' (mechanics) had to complete rearming and refuelling in 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> Galland insisted that the air units aircraft should be split between high and low altitude to provide sound cover. The low altitude groups would be able to evade detection by British coastal radar. Galland demanded an umbrella of at least 16 fighters over the ships at any one time along the whole length of the channel. The fighter group would be split into two groups of eight aircraft for their respective patrol altitudes. Each formation was split into two Schwärme of four aircraft. The Schwärme tactics involved one formation flying to sea and one to land in a zigzag pattern. All Schwärme were ordered to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight while maintaining radio silence. Every sortie was meticulously timed to allow the fighters exactly 30 minutes over the ships, enough to maintain cover and allow the relieved units to refuel and rearm and return to start the cycle again. However, during Donnerkeil, the relieving sortie would arrive after only 20 minutes which meant the actual fighter cover for half the dash would be 32 fighters.|$|E
