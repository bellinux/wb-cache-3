Registration for MOSS is voluntary. If suppliers decide against the MOSS, registration will be required in each Member State where B2C supplies of e-services are made. With no minimum turnover threshold for the new EU VAT rules, VAT registration will be required regardless of the value of e-service supply in each Member State. EU MOSS registrations opened on 1 October 2014 ...|$|E

40|$|From 1 st January 2015, in the European Unionwill {{enter into}} force a new VAT regime for {{business-to-consumer}} suppliers of telecoms, broadcasting and electronic services. This regime {{will have an impact}} on businesses engaged in the supply of certain products and services over the Internet. This article is a literature review. It is aimed to provide an analysis of the European VAT regime applicable to electronic services and clarify some key issues like: what are e-services, what are the changes and how the businesses are affected by these new rules. The paper also approaches issues such as: the change of the rules regarding VAT place of supplying and the introduction of the VAT <b>Mini</b> <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Shop</b> (MOSS). The main conclusion is that the change in the place of supplying rules will serve to negate the VAT advantages associated with Internet companies which locate their invoicing functions in a Member State that is different from where they locate their substantial activities...|$|E
40|$|A fast-growing {{portion of}} overall taxable {{consumption}} is now realized via online supplies and this ‘digital economy’ {{is a virtual}} reality in which suppliers and consumers conclude numerous transactions unrestrained by time and place. The contrast with traditional sales tax and value added tax (VAT) systems, {{which are based on}} a physical supply between parties, could not be more evident. Among jurisdictions worldwide, the European Union (EU) took the lead in designing a legal framework for VAT on electronically supplied goods and services. This book, with contributions by internationally re-owned academics, revenue officials, and tax advisors, provides a broad and up-to-date overview of the EU 2015 rules, and an analysis of such elements as the gradual realization of the destination principle, the fight against e-commerce fraud, and simplification of compliance obligations by means of the <b>Mini</b> <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Shop</b> (MOSS). Topics covered include the VAT dimension of:; the digital ‘fixed establishment’; businesses as tax collectors; auditing under MOSS; Internet search engines; virtual currencies (such as bitcoins); cloud computing; and technology-based solutions for the assessment and collection of VAT on online supplies. Relevant EU legislation is annexed. Because of its clear and practical analysis to these issues, this book will appeal to tax authorities and counsel who need to ensure proper taxation of online supplies at destination with the least possible administrative costs and the lowest possible compliance burdens. Because of its forward looking approach it is a ‘must’ for all public and private sector professionals concerned with VAT...|$|E
