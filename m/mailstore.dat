40|$|In this work, we {{captured}} 36 days of I/O trace from NEXUS 5 {{and analyzed}} database usage of each application. We found that 70 % of synchronous write I/Os are snet_files_info. db, esO. db, and gmail. com. db. There were 1533 records in snet_files_info. db {{that has to}} be updated for Google mobile service which creates write amplification of 6 Ã— 106. Out of 62 tables in esO. db, only 2 tables were the most frequently used tables, but surprisingly the two tables share almost exact data. <b>mailstore.</b> x@gmail. com. db creates heavy synchronous writes during during checkpoint operation.
