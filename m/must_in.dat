5|$|While {{three of}} the four {{directions}} were readily identified, West proved to be more difficult. First, an association was made with the moon goddess Hina, and a Hawaiian story in which her leg was broken. From there, Dietrich postulated that the “broken leg” glyph <b>must</b> <b>in</b> fact be the “pillar of the sunset”.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers <b>must</b> <b>in</b> their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed {{that the best way}} to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead <b>must</b> <b>in</b> return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.|$|E

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and <b>must</b> <b>in</b> any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

25|$|Chaptalization is {{the process}} of adding sugar to {{unfermented}} grape <b>must</b> <b>in</b> order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal.

25|$|The two {{pathways}} to liberation are by initiation into and {{observation of the}} austerities of sannyasa yoga or by service to a Sadguru. The former is extremely arduous– the disciple <b>must</b> <b>in</b> a sense die. In other words, he must lose body consciousness.

Amino acids can be added directly to the must though as of 2010 only glycine is permitted {{to be added to}} <b>must</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in the grape <b>must.</b> <b>In</b> the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
