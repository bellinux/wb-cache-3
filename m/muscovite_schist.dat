Three main gold-bearing shear zones were detected in the study area from the processed Landsat ETM+ images and extensive ground investigation. Field and petrographical studies indicate that the Neoproterozoic rocks are represented by a highly folded and faulted belt constituted of hornblende, muscovite and graphite schist. They are intruded by granondiorites and late to post granitic dykes. Extensive alteration zones were identified using high resolution QuickBird image along Garin Hawal shear zone. The alteration zones and associated quartz veins are generally concordant with the main NE–SW regional structural trend and are dipping to the NW. Geochemical studies indicate that the gold content reaches 8 g/t in the alteration zones, while it reaches up to 35 g/t in the quartz veins. Mineralogical studies indicate that the alterations are strongly potassium-enriched. Pyrophyllite, kaolinite, illite, gypsum and quartz also occur.

Albitization peaked during D 1 and was commonly localized along shear zones. <b>Muscovite</b> <b>schists</b> adjacent to albitites were altered to albite-bearing biotite-rich schists. Porphyroblast growth in metasomatic rocks commenced with cordierite and andalusite from late syn-D 1, but episodic growth continued to post-D 5, with the peak of metamorphism occurring late syn-D 3 to early syn-D 4. The timing of albitization was determined from {{the presence or absence of}} albite in various stages of andalusite growth, and similarly the Mg # [Mg/(Mg + Fe) ] and Cl contents of biotite were examined over the span of porphyroblast-growth history. Differential mass-transport of Mg and Fe took place from the albitites to the adjacent schists predominantly during D 1, and the Mg # for biotite in metasomatic rocks was largely fixed during D 1. The Cl content of the matrix biotite varies considerably in the different areas of albitite development, from below detection to a maximum of 1. 5 wt%. This could indicate that the Cl enrichment event was not related to albitization, but there is nevertheless an overall spatial relationship between them.

40|$|At Bangriposi, {{variable}} {{stages in}} replacement of staurolite by chloritoid - Na-K-Ca mica shimmer aggregates in <b>muscovite</b> <b>schists</b> provides {{insight into the}} complex interplay between fluid flow, mass transfer, and dissolution-precipitation during pseudomorph growth. Idioblastic chloritoid growing into mica caps without causing visible deformation, and monomineralic chloritoid veins (up to 300 mu m wide) within shimmer aggregates replacing staurolite attest to chloritoid nucleation in fluidfilled conduits along staurolite grain boundaries and crystallographic planes. The growth of shimmer aggregates initiated along staurolite margins, and advanced inwards into decomposing staurolite along networks of crystallographically controlled fluid-filled conduits. Coalescence among alteration zones adjacent to channel fills led to dismemberment and the eventual demise of staurolite. Mass balance calculation within a volume-fixed, silica-conserved reference frame indicate the shimmer aggregates grew via precipitation from fluids in response to mass transport {{that led to the}} addition of H 2 O, K 2 O, Na 2 O and CaO in the reaction zone, and Al 2 O 3 was transported outward from the inward-retreating margin of decomposing staurolite. This aided precipitation of chloritoid in veins and in the outer collars, and as disseminated grains in the shimmer aggregates at mid-crustal condition (similar to 520 +/- 20 degrees C, 5. 5 +/- 2. 0 kbar). Computation using one-dimensional transport equation suggests that staurolite decomposition involved advection dominating over diffusive transport; the permeation of externally derived H 2 O caused flattening of chemical potential gradients in H 2 O and aqueous species, for example, (Na+H- 1 +] and [Na+ K [...] 1 (+ 1) ], computed using the Gibbs method. This suggests that staurolite decomposition was promoted by the infiltration of a large volume of H 2 O that flattened existing chemical potential gradients. In the initial stages of replacement, chloritoid super-saturation in fluid caused preferential nucleation and growth of chloritoid at staurolite grain boundaries and in crystallographic planes. As reaction progressed, further chloritoid nucleation was halted, but chloritoid continued to grow as the 3 -mica aggregates continued to replace the remaining staurolite in situ, while the chloritoid-compatible elements were transported in the water-rich phase facilitating continued growth of the existing chloritoid grains...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-grade}} metamorphic {{basement of}} the Bayuda Desert is situated at the inferred transition between the juvenile Neoproterozoic mainly greenschist facies Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) and the pre-Neoproterozoic mainly amphibolite facies domain of the East Saharan Ghost Craton. New geochemical and Sr-Nd isotope data reveal that this basement in Bayuda constituted a Neoproterozoic oceanic convergent margin succession with limited and probably late input of old material. Within this series, garnet amphibolites and epidote-biotite gneisses have geochemical characteristics of HFSE-depleted tholeiitic basalts and low- to medium-K dacites and rhyodacites, indicating magmatism in an oceanic island arc or back-arc basin environment. This magmatism occurred at 806 ± 19 Ma (Sm-Nd 11 WR isochron), similar in age to arc magmatism in the ANS. Leucocratic gneisses, <b>muscovite</b> <b>schists</b> and garnet-biotite schists form the dominant meta-sedimentary rocks of the study area. They were primarily derived from two different sources: volcanogenic sediments from a Neoproterozoic island arc (TDM Nd model ages between 790 and 900 Ma) and terrigeneous sediments from an older continental source (TDM Nd model ages up to 2100 Ma). The volcanosedimentary succession was metamorphosed under amphibolite facies conditions prior to 670 Ma, probably at approximately 700 Ma. The high-grade metamorphism is related to a frontal collisional event that also produced syn-collisional peraluminous granites preserved as muscovite-biotite gneisses. Meta-igneous rocks from eastern Bayuda have εNd values at 806 Ma of + 5. 2 ± 0. 4, indicating a less depleted mantle source (crustal contamination can be excluded) than the neighbouring Gabgaba-Gebeit terrane (εNd, ca. + 7) from the Arabian-Nubian shield. Less depleted mantle source is also known at Jebel Moya to the south, and inside the Arabian-Nubian Shield to the southeast of Bayuda. Lithological and structural similarities (dominantly northeast striking foliation) with the Bayuda Desert succession occur {{in many parts of}} central and western Sudan, suggesting a comparable geodynamic evolution. It is proposed that a Neoproterozoic oceanic convergent margin (Bayuda type succession) collided at approximately 700 Ma to the northwest with the East Saharan ghost craton, whose easternmost limit must lie below or more to the west than previously thought. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.

Eight varieties of metamorphic rocks samples from this location, which are garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist, epidote-barroisite schist, glaucophane-quartz schist, garnet-muscovite schist, actinolite-talc schist, epidote schist, <b>muscovite</b> <b>schist,</b> and serpentinite, were investigated in detail its petrological and mineralogical characteristics by using polarization microscope and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). Furthermore, the pressure-temperature path of garnet-bearing epidote-barroisite schist was estimated by using mineral parageneses, reaction textures, and mineral chemistries {{to assess the}} metamorphic history. The primary stage of this rock might be represented by the assemblage of glaucophane + epidote + titanite ± paragonite. The assemblage yields 1. 7 - 1. 0 GPa in assumed temperature of 300 - 550 °C, which is interpreted as maximum pressure limit of prograde stage. The peak P-T condition estimated {{on the basis of}} the equilibrium of garnet rim, barroisite, phengite, epidote, and quartz, yields 547 - 690 °C and 1. 1 - 1. 5 GPa on the albite epidote amphibolite-facies that correspond to the depth of 38 - 50 km. The retrograde stage was presented by changing mineral compositions of amphiboles from the Si-rich barroisite to the actinolite, which lies near 0. 5 GPa at 350 °C. It could be concluded that metamorphic rocks from the Meratus Complex experienced low-temperature and high-pressure conditions (blueschist-facies) prior to the peak metamorphism of the epidote amphibolite-facies. The subduction environments in Meratus Complex during Cretaceous should be responsible for this metamorphic condition. </div...|$|E

This deposit and several other prospects are hosted within the isoclinally folded Mary River Group, a Neoarchean greenstone belt terrane hosting Algoma-type BIF, ultramafics volcaniclastics and sediment. Mary River Group supracrustals are juxtaposed against Mesoarchean basement gneisses due to a regional Transhudson Orogen overprint, forming a regional dome-keel tectonic framework. Detail mapping and core logging of Deposit No. 1 combined with geochemistry and geochronology reveal the footwall rocks, previously interpreted as gneisses, volcanics and metasediments, to be mylontized and altered ~ 2900 Ma monzogranite. The footwall monzogranite has endured three stages of hydrothermal alteration during Paleoproterozoic extension, removing up to 40 % SiO 2. Stage 1 is the formation of epidote-carbonate-hornblende veins. Stage 2 involves the breakdown of feldspars and quartz to muscovite forming quartz-augen <b>muscovite</b> <b>schist</b> (QAMS). A low amphibolite facies metamorphic event follows stage 2 alteration, producing large cordierite porphyroblasts. Stage 3 further desilicifies QAMS by biotite alteration forming quartz-augen biotite schist (QABS) and biotite schist. Retrogression of biotite schist forms chlorite schist. Stage 3 schists are overprinted by a second low amphibolite facies metamorphic event, producing andalusite-staurolite-almandine and grunerite-almandine porphyroblastic assemblages. Temperatures and pressure of the second metamorphic event are calculated between 368 - 481 °C at a max pressure of 3550 bars.

The M 1 was a regional Barrovian-type event related to crustal shortening and thickening of the Indian plate margin, while M 2 was associated with crustal melting and the emplacement of the Gumburanjon leucogranite into the Zanskar Shear Zone {{at the top of}} the slab. U-Pb dating of metamorphic and magmatic accessory phases constrains the timing of M 1 between 30 and 37 Ma and the crystallization and emplacement age of the Gumburanjon leucogranite at 21 - 22 Ma. Inherited accessory phases in metamorphic and magmatic samples suggest that the protoliths of the slab are at least Lower Paleozoic in age and that they experienced a major pre-M 1 thermal perturbation at ca. 450 - 500 Ma. Whether this was associated with a regional Barrovian-type metamorphism or whether it was a thermal event related to the intrusion of large Cambro-Ordovician granites remains uncertain. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages of <b>muscovites</b> from metamorphic <b>schists</b> range from 22. 0 ± 0. 6 to 20. 4 ± 0. 6 Ma, suggesting that cooling of the High Himalayan Slab below the nominal closure temperature for Ar loss in muscovite (~ 400 °- 350 °C) occurred during the Early Miocene.

40|$|The Soledad basin is {{situated}} {{north of the}} San Gabriel Mountains, in Los Angeles County, California, and its center is about 35 {{miles north of the}} Los Angeles civic center. Roughly an elongate parallelogram in shape, this basin has dimensions of about ten by thirty miles, with the longer dimension oriented east-west. The Sierra Pelona and the San Gabriel Mountains form the northern and southern boundaries, respectively. The San Andreas fault and the San Gabriel fault, both of which trend northwest in this region, bound the basin on its northeast and southwest borders, respectively. Only {{the northern part of the}} basin is discussed in this paper. The pre-Cretaceous Pelona schist, the oldest unit in the map area, is a thick sequence of <b>muscovite</b> <b>schist,</b> chlorite-muscovite schist and actinolite-chlorite schist with rare layers of quartzite and limestone. This unit underlies the Sierra Pelona, an elongate mountain mass which trends east-west. Granitic intrusive rocks of probable late Jurassic age underlie a complex section of Tertiary rocks in most of the eastern Soledad basin. Gneisses, some of which may represent highly injected Pelona schist, also are present in a belt that in general trends parallel to the Sierra Pelona. In general, the sedimentary beds exposed at the surface are younger from east to west in the Soledad basin. The marine Martinez formation of Paleocene age is the oldest sedimentary unit in the region. It is overlain by the Vasquez series which crops out over a wide area, and comprises interlayered fanglomerates and volcanic rocks. Where the Martinez formation has been removed by erosion prior to the deposition of the Vasquez beds, the Vasquez series rests on the pre-Tertiary crystalline rocks. This unit is of doubtful Oligocene age, and has a maximum known thickness of nearly 16, 000 feet. The Vasquez beds were deposited in three basins separated by ridges. Late in Vasquez time, these ridges were buried by thick alluvial fans built northward from the San Gabriel Mountains, and the basins thus coalesced into a single broad alluvial apron. The upper Lower Miocene Tick Canyon formation and the Upper Miocene Mint Canyon formation, which lie above the Vasquez series, also represent nonmarine deposition of dominantly coarse-grained sedimentary material. These units are widespread in the western part of the Soledad basin. Sandstone and siltstone of the "Modelo" formation rest unconformably on the Mint Canyon beds, and reflect an eastward encroachment of marine waters over a part of the basin in late Miocene time. West of the map area, the marine Pliocene Pico formation and the nonmarine Plio-Pleistocene Saugus formation, which grades westward into a marine facies, overlie the older rocks. Terrace deposits of late Pleistocene age are common over much of the area. Recent alluvium is present in all of the major valley bottoms and locally in some of the minor valleys. The date of the folding and metamorphism of the Pelona schist is not known, but it assuredly is pre-Tertiary. Tertiary rocks have been either tilted or deformed into broad open folds, although locally near the major faults nearly isoclinal folds are found. Almost without exception, these folds plunge to the west or southwest. The numerous faults are the most prominent structural features of the Soledad basin. Normal faults which trend generally east were formed in post-Martinez, pre-Vasquez time. Displacements occurred throughout Vasquez time and ceased prior to Tick Canyon time. The Pelona fault may have been reactivated just prior to Mint Canyon time. Offsets on these normal faults are as much as 10, 000 to 15, 000 feet. The normal faults indicate that the minimum compressive stress was oriented nearly north-south. Can the other hand, the post-Mint Canyon, pre-Saugus faults indicate a maximum compressive stress oriented north-south, which resulted in a number. of northeast-trending left-hand faults with displacements up to 10, 000 feet.

40|$|Keywords: Iron mineralization, {{hydrothermal}} vein, alteration, Lulak Abad, Zanjan, Central Iran Introduction The Lulak Abad iron occurrence {{is located}} in the northwestern part of the Central Iran, 55 km west of Zanjan. Mineralization at the Lulak Abad area was originally identified by Zamin Gostar Company (2007), during a geophysical exploration. The present paper provides an overview of the geological framework, the mineralization characteristics, and the results of a geochemical study of the Lulak Abad iron occurrence with an application to the ore genesis. Identification of these characteristics {{can be used as a}} model for exploration of this type of iron mineralization in the Central Iran and elsewhere. Materials and methods Detailed field work was carried out at different scales (give scales in parentheses) in the Lulak Abad area. About 16 polished thin and thin sections from host rocks and mineralized and altered zones were studied by conventional petrographic and mineralogical methods at the Department of Geology, University of Zanjan. In addition, a total of 7 samples from ore zones at the Lulak Abad occurrence were analyzed by ICP-OES for minor and trace elements and REE compositions at Geological Survey of Iran, Tehran, Iran. Result Rock units exposed in the Lulak Abad area consist of schists and metavolcanic units the Kahar Formation; Lotfi, 2001) that were intruded by granite and microdiorite bodies. The schist units consist of chlorite-biotite-muscovite schist and <b>muscovite</b> <b>schist</b> that show granolepidoblastic texture with foliation-parallel disseminated magnetite. The metavolcanic units consist of metadacite, rhyolitic metatuff and meta-andesite with porphyritic textures. They are marked by dominant mylonitic foliation surrounding feldspar and quartz porphyroclasts. Alkali feldspar and quartz are the principal minerals of the granite. The intrusion is characterized by intense deformation features and is highly mylonitized. Based on field and microscopic studies, the microdiorite postdated metamorphic and deformation events and shows neither schistosity nor mylonitic foliation. It is composed principally of plagioclase with minor disseminated magnetite and a microgranular texture. Two deformation events are recognized at the Lulak Abad area, one principally ductile, the other brittle. Iron mineralization at Lulak Abad occurs as veins, veinlets and lens-shaped bodies in schist units, mylonitic metavolvanic rocks and mylonitic granite. The main ore vein extends up to 100 m in length and averages 3 m in width, reaching a maximum of 6 m. It trends NE, dipping steeply SE. The ore lenses are parallel to the mylonitic foliation and variably boudinaged, about 10 m in length and vary in thickness up to 5 cm. Two stages of mineralization can be distinguished at Lulak Abad. Stage 1 mineralization is recognized as stratiform and stratabound lenses, laminated and disseminated crystals of magnetite in volcano-sedimentary host rocks. Stage 2 is characterized as hematite-pyrite-calcite veins and veinlets cutting the mylonitic foliation of the host rocks. Hydrothermal alteration is restricted to silicified, calcitic and chloritic altered parts of the ore zones. The ore minerals at Lulak Abad formed as vein and hydrothermal breccia cements, and show vein-veinlet, brecciated, disseminated and open space filling vein and veinlet textures. Hematite is the main ore mineral, accompanied by minor magnetite and pyrite. Goethite occurs as a supergene mineral. Quartz, calcite and chlorite are present in the gangue minerals that represent vein-veinlet and vug filling textures. The Lulak Abad mineralized veins and breccias show lower concentrations of LREE and HREE (i. e., Pr, Er, Ho, Dy and Yb) relative to barren granitic host rocks but higher Tm, Gd, Eu and Lu concentrations. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Sun and McDonough, 1989) of host barren granite and the mineralized samples at Lulak Abad indicate that mineralized samples are depleted in LREE (except Ce) but enriched in most HREE (beside depletion in Dy and Ho). These signatures indicate high wall rock interaction (e. g., Lottermoser, 1992; Liegeois et al., 2003). Comparison of the geological, mineralogical, geochemical, textural and structural characteristics of the Lulak Abad occurrence with different types of iron deposits reveals that iron mineralization at Lulak Abad was originally formed as volcano-sedimentary, and then reconcentrated as vein mineralization (Karami et al., 2012; Karami et al., 2013).

40|$|Gneiss domes {{involving}} the South Tibetan Detachment System {{provide evidence for}} crustal extension simultaneous with shortening. The Nielaxiongbo gneiss dome is composed of a metamorphic complex of granitic gneiss, amphibolite, and migmatite; a ductilely deformed middle crustal layer of staurolite-or garnet-bearing schist; and a cover sequence of weakly metamorphosed Triassic and Lower Cretaceous strata. The middle crust ductilely deformed layer is separated from both the basement complex and the cover sequence by lower and upper detachments, respectively, with a smaller detachment fault occurring within the ductilely deformed layer. Leucogranites crosscut the basement complex, the lower detachment, and the middle crustal layer, but do not intrude the upper detachment or the cover sequence. Three deformational fabrics are recognized: a N-S compressional fabric (D 1) in the cover sequence, a north-and south-directed extensional fabric (D 2) in the upper detachment and lower tectonic units, and a deformation (D 3) related to the leucogranite intrusion. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating yielded a metamorphic age of 514 million years for the amphibolite and a crystallization age of 20 million years for the leucogranite. Hornblende from the amphibolite has an 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 18 0. 3 million years, whereas <b>muscovites</b> from the <b>schist</b> and leucogranite yielded 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages between 13. 5 0. 2 and 13. 0 0. 2 million years. These {{results suggest that the}} basement was consolidated at 510 Ma and then exhumed during extension and silicic plutonism at 20 Ma. Continuing exhumation led to cooling through the 500 C Ar closure temperature in hornblende at 18 Ma to the 350 C Ar closure temperature in muscovite at 13 Ma. The middle crustal ductilely deformed layer within gneiss domes of southern Tibet defines a southward-extruding ductile channel, marked by leucogranites emplaced into migmatites and amphibolites. We propose a model involving thinned upper crust for the initial extension of the Tibetan Plateau in the early Miocene. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Metamorphic muscovite clasts inherited into the Alpine Fault gouge yielded Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages of 2. 04 +/- 0. 3 Ma at Gaunt Creek and 11. 46 +/- 0. 47 Ma at Harold Creek. We also report Rb-Sr muscovite-based multimineral ages of Alpine Schist mylonite adjacent to the dated fault gouge at Harold Creek (13. 1 +/- 43 Ma) and Gaunt Creek (8. 9 +/- 3. 2 Ma). Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 muscovite ages from the Gaunt Creek mylonite yielded plateau ages of 1. 47 +/- 0. 08 Ma and 1. 57 +/- 0. 15 Ma. Finally, we report zircon fission track (0. 79 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 81 +/- 0. 17 Ma) and zircon (U-Th) /He ages (0. 35 +/- 0. 03 and 0. 4 +/- 0. 06 Ma) from Harold Creek. & para;& para;We interpret the fault gouge ages to date growth of newly formed illite during gouge formation at temperatures of similar to 300 - 350 degrees C towards the base of the seismogenic zone. Simple backcalculation using current uplift/exhumation and convergence rates, and dip angles of 45 - 60 degrees at the Alpine Fault support that interpretation. We infer that the fault gouge ages record faulting and gouge formation as the rocks passed very rapidly through the brittle-ductile transition zone on their way to the surface. Rb-Sr and Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages on <b>muscovite</b> from Alpine <b>Schist</b> mylonite date <b>muscovite</b> growth at similar to 11 Ma together with a younger phase of cooling/shearing at similar to 1. 5 - 2 Ma. Our ages from the Alpine Schist indicate extremely rapid cooling exceeding 200 degrees C/Ma. The fault gouge age from the Two Thumbs Fault is significantly too old to have formed as part of the late Neogene/Quaternary Southern Alps evolution. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{summarizes}} the geodynamic {{evolution of the}} Variscan to Mesozoic Tethyan subduction history, based on a review of geochronological data from Eastern Anatolia and the Lesser Caucasus, and new isotopic ages for the Georgian crystalline basements. The geological history of the basements of Georgia (Transcaucasus) and NE Turkey (eastern Pontides) appears to be similar and provides evidence for a continuously active continental margin above a north-dipping subduction {{since at least the}} Lower Jurassic. New La-ICPMS U-Pb ages from the Georgian basement provide further evidence for the derivation of the Transcaucasus and its western continuation (the eastern Pontides) from Gondwana. A migmatized granodiorite provides preserved magmatic zircon cores with an age of 474 ± 3 Ma, while the age of migmatization is constrained by its 343 ± 2 Ma metamorphic rims. Metamorphism is synchronous with widespread I-type granites that were emplaced at 335 ± 8 Ma in the neighbouring Dzirula massif, and in the eastern Pontides. These U-Pb ages are in close agreement with recently obtained Ar/Ar ages from biotites and <b>muscovites</b> from metamorphic <b>schists</b> and U-Pb ages ranging from 340 to 330 Ma in the Georgian basement. The narrow range of ages suggests that the Variscan LP-HT metamorphic event in the eastern Pontides and Georgia was of short duration and likely related to mantle-derived intrusives. Furthermore, we suggest that (1) rifting of the Pontides-Transcaucasus block (PTB) from Gondwana at 450 – 350 Ma could have been driven by roll-back of the south-dipping Rheic slab, (2) that the main metamorphic and coeval magmatic events are related to the accretion of the PTB to the Eurasian margin at c. 350 Ma, while the source of magmatism is ascribed to slab detachment of the south-dipping slab at 340 Ma and that (3) three subduction zones may have been contemporaneously active in the Tethyan domain during the Jurassic: (i) the Lesser Caucasus South Armenian Block (SAB) shares a similar Gondwana affinity, but bears younger ages for its MP-MT metamorphic evolution and calc-alkaline magmatism bracketed from 160 to 123 Ma; (ii) north-dipping subduction below the PTB from c. 210 Ma to 150 Ma; (iii) northward intra-oceanic subduction bracketed from 180 to 90 Ma between the SAB and the PTB...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The ca. 800 km 2 Tete Complex of NW Mozambique {{is located}} at the eastern end of the 830 ± 30 Ma Zambezi Belt, near the {{transition}} zone into the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt. The Complex is located just south of the Sanangoe Shear Zone where Mesozoic and Late Palaeozoic cover rocks obscure much of the region. Country rocks immediately in contact with the Tete Complex include amphibolitic gneiss, graphite-bearing marble, calcsilicate gneiss, <b>muscovite</b> and biotite <b>schist</b> and quartzite of the Chidue Group. The Tete Complex may have been intrusive into the Chidue Group, although there is evidence inferring tectonic emplacement. Those few contact exposures that exist are equivocal. Some of the rocks within the Tete Complex have been affected by metamorphism up to amphibolite grade, although large proportions of the rocks retain pristine magmatic mineralogy and texture. The Tete Complex contains mafic, ultramafic and anorthositic rocks, dolerite dykes and minor Fe-Ti oxide-rich rocks that occur as rubble. Pyroxenite occurs as thin (< 1 - 2 m), cumulate layers within gabbroic rocks. Most exposed anorthositic rocks occur in the Nyangoma area {{in the eastern part of}} the Tete Complex. The anorthosites and leucotroctolites are massive, coarse grained (2 - 3 cm), and contain plagioclase (An 47 -An 57) megacrysts up to 10 cm in length, interstitial olivine (Fo 59 -Fobs) and orthopyroxene (En 59 - En 75, mean A 1203 = 1. 84 wt. %) rimmed by clinopyroxene (mean = Wo 46 En 38 Fs i 6), pyrite and Fe-Ti oxides. Secondary biotite, iddingsite, epidote and green spinet are present. The stable coexistence of olivine and plagioclase limits the depth of emplacement to < 7 - 8 kbar, or < 20 - 25 km; a relatively shallow level of emplacement is favored by the generally fine grain size of the gabbroic and doleritic rocks. Compositions of coexisting plagioclase and mafic silicates (orthopyroxene and olivine) are similar to those of massif-type anorthosites. Previously unmapped meta-anorthosite occurs along the western and northern margin (within the Sanangoe Shear Zone) of the Tete Complex and has been metamorphosed to amphibolite grade. The rock contains plagioclase (An 38 -An 39), with the more Ab-rich compositions related to the formation of garnet (mean = A 1 m 67 GrotsPYI 6 Sp 2). Metamorphic orthopyroxene (Enso-En 53), clinopyroxene (mean = Wo 37 En 38 Fs 25), mizzonitic scapolite (Me 63), amphibole, biotite and apatite are present. High Cl contents in amphibole, scapolite and biotite (e. g., up to 4. 7 wt. % in amphibole), suggest that a Cl-rich metamorphic fluid infiltrated the western margin of the Tete Complex. Olivine melagabbro from the north-central part of the Tete Complex contains plagioclase (An 70 -An 26), olivine (Fo 82 -Fos 4) and clinopyroxene (mean = WanEn 1 Fs 0. 2, mean A 1203 = 2. 56 wt. %), with primitive compositions compared to those in Nyangoma anorthositic rocks and pyroxenites. Pyroxenites are modally dominated by clinopyroxene (mean = Wo 46 - 48 En 36 - 39 Fsi 3 - 18) with accessory interstitial plagioclases (Ano-An 45) and discrete and exsolved orthopyroxenes (En 56 -En 75). Clinopyroxenes with high A 1203 contents up to 9 wt. % are similar to high-Al pyroxene megacrysts. One sample of pyroxenite contains orthopyroxene (En 56 -En 60) and plagioclase (An 40 -An 45) with more evolved compositions compared to those in Nyangoma anorthositic rocks and olivine melagabbro. Normal Fe 4 - and Na-enrichment trends accompanying fractionation from magmas that may be common to the Nyangoma anorthositic rocks, pyroxenites and olivine melagabbro, are associated with an increase in Al relative to Cr along a line of nearly constant relative Ti content. Gabbro contains olivine and plagioclase crystals that are commonly zoned, thus ranging widely in composition (Fool -Fos°, Anss-Ans 2) • Clinopyroxene (mean = Wo 36 En 47 Fsi 6) constitutes ca. 34 modal % of gabbro. New whole-rock (Nyangoma anorthosite and leucotroctolite) and mineral (plagioclase, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene) Sm-Nd isotopic data yields ages between 975 ± 33 Ma and 1041 ± 131 Ma. The igneous crystallization age of the anorthositic rocks is estimated at 1025 ± 79 Ma (9 -point whole-rock regression). Rb-Sr isotopic compositions for whole-rock samples reveal no meaningful age relationships. Initial Nd isotopic compositions (calculated at 1. 0 Ga) correspond to E Nd values between + 3. 5 and + 4. 5 (mean = + 4. 1) with Is, = 0. 70276 — 0. 70288 (mean = 0. 70282), both inferring magmatic derivation from a depleted mantle source, possibly with little or no contamination by Archaean crustal components. TDM model ages range between 1074 and 1280 Ma (mean = 1148 Ma). There is a striking similarity between the Tete Complex anorthosites and those of SW Madagascar in terms of Nd isotopic compositions and the nature of country rocks; in both regions the anorthosites were emplaced either magmatically or tectonically into shelf-type supracrustal metasediments (marbles, quartzites, graphitic schists, etc.). Anorthosites intruded similar country rocks in Draining Maud Land, eastern Antarctica. Although anorthosites from Mozambique and Madagascar share a common depleted mantle signature with little or no contamination by Archaean crustal components, a direct stratigraphic correlation between these two areas (and possibly eastern Antarctica), awaits further geological and geochronological data...|$|R
