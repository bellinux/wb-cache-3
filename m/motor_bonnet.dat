She was sitting back among the cushions of her Sixty horse-power Daimler, wrapped in a motoring coat of the latest fashion, her somewhat brilliant coloring only partially obscured by the silver-gray veil which drooped from her <b>motor</b> <b>bonnet.</b> Burton took his place beside her almost in silence, and they glided off. She looked at him curiously.|$|E

[Continues {{strutting}} around, imitating {{what she}} considers are a man's stride and swagger, returns to table {{and proceeds to}} unwrap parcel.] Well, I'll go out like a girl, if I did come in like a man. [Drops wrapping paper on table and holds up a woman's long automobile cloak and a <b>motor</b> <b>bonnet.</b> Is suddenly startled by sound of approaching footsteps and glances in a frightened way toward door.] Mercy! Here comes somebody now! [Glances about her in alarm, drops cloak and bonnet on floor close to table, seizes a handful of newspapers, and runs to large leather chair to right of table, where she seats herself hurriedly. One paper she holds up before her, hiding {{her face as she}} pretends to read. Unfortunately the paper is upside down. The other papers lie on her lap.] ...|$|E

[She rises, {{crosses to}} table, {{and is about}} to stoop for <b>motor</b> cloak and <b>bonnet,</b> but he {{forestall}} her, holds cloak and helps her into it.] Thank you. [She takes off wig, fluffs her own hair becomingly, and puts on bonnet, looking every inch a pretty young girl, ready for an automobile ride.] ...|$|R

He lays cigarette case on table and picks them up. They strike him as profoundly curious things to be in a club room. He looks at MAUD, then sees card on table. He picks it up and reach it to himself, then looks at her with comprehension. Hidden by her newspaper, she sees nothing. He looks at card again and reads and speaks in an aside.] ...|$|R
