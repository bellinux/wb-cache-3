Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, {{like the rest of the}} high nobility, benefited by <b>Madrid's</b> <b>rule,</b> but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded him. In any event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (João IV).|$|R

Metropolitan areas legal definition and its consequences In formal legal terms, a metropolitan area in Spain is a voluntary mechanism which can be set up (or not) by an Autonomous Community to better structure its territory.
