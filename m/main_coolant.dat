40|$|Current {{models of}} galaxy {{formation}} lack an efficient and physically constrained mechanism to regulate star formation (SF) in low and intermediate mass galaxies. We {{argue that the}} missing ingredient could be the effect of photoionization by local sources on the gas cooling. We show that the soft X-ray and EUV flux generated by SF is able to efficiently remove the <b>main</b> <b>coolants</b> (e. g., HeII, OV and FeIX) from the halo gas via direct photoionization. As a consequence, the cooling and accretion time of the gas surrounding star-forming galaxies may increase by one or two orders of magnitude. For a given halo mass and redshift, the effect {{is directly related to}} the value of the star formation rate (SFR). Our results suggest the existence of a critical SFR above which "cold" mode accretion is stopped, even for haloes with virial masses well below the critical shock-heating mass suggested by previous studies. The evolution of the critical SFR with redshift, for a given halo mass, resembles the respective steep evolution of the observed SFR for z< 1. This suggests that photoionization by local sources would be able to regulate gas accretion and star formation, without the need for additional, strong feedback processes.

2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the <b>main</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the <b>main</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|E

40|$|We derive the {{electron}} temperature gradient in the Galactic disk using {{a sample of}} Hii regions that spans Galactocentric distances 0 – 17 kpc. The electron temperature was calculated using high precision radio recombination line and continuum observations for more than 100 Hii regions. Nebular Galactocentric distances were calculated in a consistent manner using the radial velocities measured by our radio recombination line survey. The large number of nebulae widely distributed over the Galactic disk together with the uniformity of our data provide a secure estimate of the present electron temperature gradient in the Milky Way. Because metals are the <b>main</b> <b>coolants</b> in the photoionized gas, {{the electron}} temperature along the Galactic disk should be {{directly related to the}} distribution of heavy elements in the Milky Way. Our best estimate of the electron temperature gradient is derived from a sample of 76 sources for which we have the highest quality data. The present gradient in electron temperature has a minimum at the Galactic Center and rises at a rate of 287 ± 46 K kpc − 1. There are no significant variations {{in the value of the}} gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius or azimuth. The scatter we find in the Hii region electron temperatures at a given Galactocentric radius is not due to observational error, but rather to intrinsic fluctuations in these temperatures which are almost certainly due to fluctuations in the nebular heavy element abundances.

40|$|Many {{parameters}} constraining {{the spectral}} appearance of exoplanets are still poorly understood. We therefore study {{the properties of}} irradiated exoplanet atmospheres over a wide parameter range including metallicity, C/O ratio and host spectral type. We calculate a grid of 1 -d radiative-convective atmospheres and emission spectra. We perform the calculations with our new Pressure-Temperature Iterator and Spectral Emission Calculator for Planetary Atmospheres (PETIT) code, assuming chemical equilibrium. The atmospheric structures and spectra are made available online. We find that atmospheres of planets with C/O ratios ∼ 1 and T_ eff ≳ 1500 K can exhibit inversions due to heating by the alkalis because the <b>main</b> <b>coolants</b> CH_ 4, H_ 2 O and HCN are depleted. Therefore, temperature inversions possibly occur without the presence of additional absorbers like TiO and VO. At low temperatures {{we find that the}} pressure level of the photosphere strongly influences whether the atmospheric opacity is dominated by either water (for low C/O) or methane (for high C/O), or both (regardless of the C/O). For hot, carbon-rich objects this pressure level governs whether the atmosphere is dominated by methane or HCN. Further we find that host stars of late spectral type lead to planetary atmospheres which have shallower, more isothermal temperature profiles. In agreement with prior work we find that for planets with T_ eff < 1750 K the transition between water or methane dominated spectra occurs at C/O ∼ 0. 7, instead of ∼ 1, because condensation preferentially removes oxygen.

In a metal-free environment, the <b>main</b> available <b>coolants</b> are H, He, H_ 2 and HD; once the gas is enriched with metals, these also become important. In this work, in order to properly determine the SF in the early Universe, we compute fine-structure transition metal cooling and implement and test molecular chemistry. Moreover, we investigate its redshift (z) evolution and compare different modeling running very high-resolution, three-dimensional, N-body/hydrodynamic simulations including non-equilibrium, atomic and molecular chemistry, SF prescriptions and feedback effects.

40|$|Feedback {{from the}} most massive {{components}} of a young stellar cluster deeply affects the surrounding ISM driving an expanding over-pressured hot gas cavity in it. In spiral galaxies these structures may have sufficient energy to break the disk and eject large amount of material into the halo. The cycling of this gas, which eventually will fall back onto the disk, is known as galactic fountains. We aim at better understanding the dynamics of such fountain flow in a Galactic context, frame the problem in a more dynamic environment possibly learning about its connection and regulation to the local driving mechanism and understand {{its role as a}} metal diffusion channel. The interaction of the fountain with a hot corona is hereby analyzed, trying to understand the properties and evolution of the extraplanar material. We perform high resolution hydrodynamical simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to model the multi-phase ISM of a Milky Way type galaxy. A non-equilibrium chemical network is included to self consistently follow the evolution of the <b>main</b> <b>coolants</b> of the ISM. Spiral arm perturbations in the potential are considered so that large molecular gas structures are able to dynamically form here, self shielded from the interstellar radiation field. We model the effect of SN feedback from a new-born stellar cluster inside such a giant molecular cloud, as the driving force of the fountain. Passive Lagrangian tracer particles are used in conjunction to the SN energy deposition to model and study diffusion of freshly synthesized metals. We find that both interactions with hot coronal gas and local ISM properties and motions are equally important in shaping the fountain. We notice a bimodal morphology where most of the ejected gas is in a cold 10 ^ 4 K clumpy state while the majority of the affected volume is occupied by a hot diffuse medium.

About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – {{in nuclear}} power plants using {{pressurized}} water as the <b>main</b> <b>coolant</b> maintaining system pressure within prescribed limits is necessary. The volume of the <b>main</b> <b>coolant</b> expands and contracts with average temperature variations causing insurges and outsurges in the surge tank volume which is called "pressurizer". The surge tank acts {{in a way in}} which coolant pressure is maintained within prescribed limits. The surge tank is equipped with a spray and relief system as well as electric heating elements. The pressure is controlled by the increase in bubble populations through heating and / or flashing or steam condensation through water sprays. This paper analyses the transient behavior of the surge tank in a WWER type pressurized water nuclear power plant. An analytical method is developed for predicting pressure and water level variations in the surge tank following in or out surge processes. The analysis also takes into consideration the variation of the thermodynamic mass qualities inside the surge tank.

The motivation for the development of SSTEP lies in the desire to gain a basic understanding of the engine performance effects of several common SSME hardware modifications. Specifically, this model has been used to evaluate the changes in performance due to boundary layer coolant hole enlargement, LOX post plugging, acoustic cavity elimination, baffle removal, and <b>main</b> combustion chamber <b>coolant</b> leakage. The results show a good general agreement with the available test data suggesting at least a qualitative agreement between SSTEP modeling and actual engine performance. Through the use of several adjustment factors, which represent relaxations of the SSTEP formulation assumptions, it is shown that the test data can be very closely matched and that SSTEP {{can be used as a}} performance prediction tool...|$|R
