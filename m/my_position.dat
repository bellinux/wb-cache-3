5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in <b>my</b> <b>position</b> as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of <b>my</b> <b>position</b> on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a {{distinguished}} contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of <b>my</b> <b>position,</b> is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left <b>my</b> <b>position,</b> nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for {{all that}} time," [...] {{answered}} Basil, smiling. [...] "I have long given up <b>my</b> official <b>position,</b> <b>my</b> dear Philip, and {{have been living in}} a deliberate retirement. I hope I do not come at an inopportune moment." ...|$|R
60|$|His absence in Paris {{having been}} mentioned, I stated plainly <b>my</b> own <b>position</b> toward {{him at the}} present time.|$|R
60|$|An {{incident}} arose at last out of {{this condition}} of things which had a very important effect upon <b>my</b> future <b>position.</b>|$|R
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. <b>My</b> <b>position</b> as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work in}} his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. The text {{is similar to a}} cantata text [...] (I am content with <b>my</b> <b>position),</b> which Picander published in 1728, but it is not certain that he wrote also the cantata text. Its thoughts about being content are {{in the spirit of the}} beginning Enlightenment, expressed in simple language. The closing chorale is the 12th stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] by Ämilie Juliane von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. [...] is one of the few works which Bach called [...] "Cantata" [...] himself.|$|E
500|$|Wegener {{said that}} police {{had chosen to}} storm the second-floor {{classroom}} after the man ended negotiations, stating that [...] "something would happen at 4 p.m." [...] SWAT team members witnessed Morrison assaulting the girls, and Wegener {{made the decision to}} save the hostages by force, stating later, [...] "My decision was either wait possibility of having two dead hostages or act and try to save what I feared he would do to them. ... Because I'd want whoever was in <b>my</b> <b>position</b> to do the same thing, and that is to save lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cain once {{responded to}} a comment {{that he had been}} a 'reactionary' in the U.S. Senate. [...] "... as a reactionary I reacted {{strongly}} against measures believed to be adverse to the public interest. It seldom bothered me that a number of <b>my</b> <b>positions</b> were supported only by a small minority. Had I been concerned with self rather than country I would have acted much differently. I was often angry and too impatient for my own good." ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>my</b> present <b>position</b> I could {{scarcely}} be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.|$|R
60|$|VIOLET. What {{objection}} {{have you}} to me, pray? <b>My</b> social <b>position</b> {{is as good}} as Hector's, to say the least. He admits it.|$|R
500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk. [...] "It was weird when I first joined the band because we {{recorded}} the album after I'd {{been in the}} band {{for just a few}} months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks", Frusciante recalled. [...] "I was still a little bit confused about <b>my</b> <b>position</b> and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his victory}} in the presidential election, John {{resigned}} from his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until February 22, 1962, when he would turn thirty years of age. Initially Ted wanted to stay out West and do something other than run for office right away; he said, [...] "The disadvantage of <b>my</b> <b>position</b> is being constantly compared with two brothers of such superior ability." [...] His brothers were {{not in favor of}} his running immediately either, but ultimately Ted coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers' and their father overruled them. Therefore, John asked Massachusetts Governor Foster Furcolo to name Kennedy family friend Ben Smith as interim senator for John's unexpired term, which he did in December 1960. This kept the seat available for Ted.|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{spent much}} of the four months between {{election}} and inauguration reading about the vice presidency, preparing for the move, and winding down some business affairs. [...] He did not, however, resign from the boards of corporations which would not have business before the federal government. [...] "It would be highly ridiculous for me to resign from the different companies in which I am officer and a stockholder whose interests are not in the least affected, or likely to be, by <b>my</b> <b>position</b> as Vice President." [...] On March 2, 1897 the Hobarts left Paterson to travel to Washington by special train. [...] On March 4, Garret Hobart was inaugurated as vice president in the Senate Chamber. [...] The Chicago Daily News predicted, [...] "Garret A. Hobart will not be seen or heard until, after four years, he emerges from the impenetrable vacuum of the Vice Presidency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I only speak, my lord, {{for your}} own comfort," [...] said Slope; [...] "{{for your own}} comfort and dignity in the diocese. I can have no other motive. As far as {{personal}} feelings go, Mrs. Proudie is the best friend I have. I must always remember that. But still, in <b>my</b> present <b>position,</b> <b>my</b> first duty is to your lordship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I {{permitted}} {{my companion}} {{to see the}} lawyer, I felt the necessity of consulting him as to <b>my</b> present <b>position</b> toward her first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having now {{sufficiently}} explained <b>my</b> present <b>position,</b> I {{may tell}} {{you of the}} extraordinary accident to which I have alluded {{at the beginning of}} my letter.|$|R
500|$|Despite Cissé's two goals, {{there had}} been {{speculation}} linking Liverpool with re-signing Michael Owen, who had left the club for Real Madrid a year earlier. Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, {{because there has been}} a lot of speculation about me of late and about <b>my</b> <b>position</b> within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him. We're the players – it's up to us to play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Mason was {{influenced}} by his father's Liberal politics and strongly opposed to injustice and prejudice. Thomas Mason was a supporter of political representation for Ashton-under-Lyne and supported {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws. In the early 19th century, the area was poorly represented in Parliament. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport with a combined population of almost one million were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire (or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport). By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were elected by a total of just 154voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform and eventually the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Hugh said of his father that [...] "To his life of honest industry, to his example of commercial probity, to his high Christian character, to his training, of me in my early years, to his wise consuls, I owe under God <b>my</b> <b>position</b> in society." ...|$|E
500|$|As in {{the earlier}} years, the cantata text {{is related to the}} gospel in the general way that the Christian should be content with his share of good fortune, without envy of others who may seem more fortunate. The title and the text show {{similarities}} to Picander's [...] (I am content with <b>my</b> <b>position),</b> published in 1728. It is unclear if both texts are by Picander, or if Picander based his on a former one, or if Picander's was already available {{at the time of the}} composition but was changed. As the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann observes, the thoughts are in the spirit of the beginning Enlightenment, [...] "praise of frugality, of modesty with that which God has allocated to us, of satisfaction, of lack of envy towards others". The language is no longer the [...] "rhetorical pathos of baroque poetry", but [...] "radicality and artistry of the imagery. The language is simple and terse; it is rational rather than figurative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here they come," [...] said I; and I {{returned}} to <b>my</b> former <b>position,</b> for it seemed beneath my dignity {{that they should}} find me watching them.|$|R
60|$|I shall {{keep these}} pages {{open for a}} few days more, on the chance of {{something}} happening which may alter <b>my</b> present <b>position</b> for the better.|$|R
60|$|Lying {{awake in}} the still night, alone on a strange sea, there were moments when I found myself {{beginning}} to doubt the reality of <b>my</b> own <b>position.</b>|$|R
500|$|Yale Divinity School ethics {{professor}} Sister Margaret Farley {{said that}} her signing of the 1984 advertisement came up in early 1986 when {{she was to be}} honored with an award given by John Carroll University, a Catholic institution in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cleveland archdiocese wrote to the Vatican to determine Farley's status, and the Vatican responded that Farley [...] "has retracted her signature from the 'Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion. Sister Helen Amos, the president of Farley's order, the Sisters of Mercy, was quoted by the Vatican: [...] "Sister Margaret's position is in accord with the teaching of the Church." [...] This statement had been accepted as a recantation by Cardinal Hamer in December 1985. After learning of the Vatican response, Farley said Hamer's assumption was in error, that she had never recanted or asked that her signature be removed. She said, [...] "What I did...was to clarify <b>my</b> <b>position.</b> And that was accepted as sufficient." ...|$|E
500|$|Gil {{describes}} his attitude towards politics thus: [...] "I'd rather see <b>my</b> <b>position</b> {{in the government}} as that of an administrator or manager. But politics is a necessary ingredient." [...] His political career began in 1987, {{when he was elected}} to a local post in Bahia and became the Salvador secretary of culture. In 1988, {{he was elected to the}} city council and subsequently became city commissioner for environmental protection. However, he left the office after one term and declined to run for the National Congress of Brazil. In 1990, Gil left the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and joined the Green Party. During this period, Gil founded the environmental protection organization Onda Azul (Blue Wave), which worked to protect Brazilian waters. He maintained a full-time musical career at the same time, and withdrew temporarily from politics in 1992, following the release Parabolicamará, considered to be one of his most successful efforts. On October 16, 2001 Gil accepted his nomination to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, having promoted the organization before his appointment.|$|E
500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from <b>my</b> <b>position</b> nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{referred}} to <b>my</b> social <b>position,</b> Miss Von Taer. Our family is honest enough, thank God; {{but it has}} never been accepted in what is termed select society." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "With radio {{being so}} playlisted these days, I felt it {{important}} to use <b>my</b> lucky <b>position</b> within the industry to promote and support music I felt really strongly about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear, we must move. We {{must have}} our head-quarters in London now. In short, there's a {{dwelling-house}} rent-free, attached to <b>my</b> new <b>position,</b> {{and we must}} occupy it.' ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in <b>my</b> <b>position.</b> But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not <b>my</b> <b>position</b> to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite <b>my</b> <b>position</b> and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} see that much, at any rate. I never {{deliberately}} meant to do as I did. I slipped into <b>my</b> false <b>position</b> through jealousy and agitation!" ...|$|R
