40|$|For case {{hardening}} steel, {{the relationship between}} microstructure and machinability is investigated. To {{be able to determine}} the influence of morphology, i. e. grain size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing in pearlite, homogeneous material is required. However, a homogeneous microstructure can only be guaranteed when small material volumes are used. For that reason the Volvo Standard <b>Machinability</b> <b>Test</b> has been applied, as it allows ranking of materials with respect to their machinability by removing only small amounts of material (~ 800 mm of a bar with 50 mm diameter for each material). In addition to what is described in the standard of the test, a number of observations and experiences have been made. In this article the observations in connection with the Volvo Standard <b>Machinability</b> <b>Test</b> are critically discussed.

In this matter, a thin nanocomposite film made out of AlCrN (aluminum–chromium–nitride) was studied in this research, showing experimental work in the deposition process and its characterization. A heat-treated monolayer coating, competitive with other coatings in the machining of titanium alloys, was analyzed. Different analysis and characterizations were performed on the manufactured coating by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of the coating was evaluated through hardness test and tribology with pin-on-disk to quantify friction coefficient and wear rate. Finally, <b>machinability</b> <b>tests</b> using coated tungsten carbide cutting tools were executed {{in order to determine}} its performance through wear resistance, which is a key issue of cutting tools in high-end cutting at elevated temperatures.

Wear of tool steels leads to shortening of the length, so small that the tool bits are no more usable. These waste and thrown away tool bits were collected which may include steel waste, pig iron, molybdenum iron, chromium iron, vanadium iron, tungsten iron and other waste material. This mixture was melted in induction furnace at temperature about 1600 o C to 1700 o C. After that the casting of the melt was done through the centrifugal route at speeds of 200 rpm and 250 rpm. The cast obtained is in the shape of tool steel cylinder. Then the samples were prepared for the hardness test, <b>machinability</b> <b>test</b> and SEM analysis. The hardness was measured across the radius of the cast cylinder by using Rockwell hardness test machine in C-scale. The <b>machinability</b> <b>test</b> specimens were taken from the outer zone of the cast cylinder and the test was carried out in Lathe by keeping the variables such as rotation speed (420 rpm), feed rate (0. 15 KM), rack angle (10 0) material to be machined (mild steel) and time of machining (5 minutes 40 seconds) constant. The machinability of the centrifugally cast samples were compared with the as-cast samples. SEM micrographs were taken for the outer region of the cast cylinder and a comparative study was made with the as-cast samples.

ArcelorMittal has developed specific programs for <b>machinability</b> <b>testing</b> in turning, {{low and high}} speed drilling and gear machining.

Gear machining {{is one of the}} main machining operations involved in powertrain manufacturing operations. The literature proposes many papers dealing with this process however there are too few studies interested in steel machinability evaluation while gear machining. This paper focuses on a particular gear manufacturing process, i. e. gear hobbing, and more precisely on steel machinability for gear hobbing applications. Tools as well as kinematics of gear hobbing are quite complex. This paper proposes a comprehensive experimental protocol for <b>machinability</b> <b>testing.</b> This protocol is based on a European standard. Tests are performed on a machine tool using a commercially available cutting tool. Tests provide the range of cutting conditions for five different steel grades. Both steels have a ferrite-pearlite structure with yield stress from 530 to 800 MPa and ultimate tensile stress from 680 to 900 MPa. Four grades are devoted to bar machining. The last one is devoted to forming and then machining operations. Many metallurgical solutions are investigated to enhance machinability such as lead addition or increase in sulfur content or calcium treatment. This paper analyses the influence of steel composition and structure on machinability.

Thus, more study is needed to increase the understanding for the laser sintered material machining characteristic to gain benefit from the invention of MLSS. This paper clarified the analysis of laser sintered material machinability with the application of Finite Element Method (FEM).

40|$|Typical {{products}} made of {{case hardening steel}} are transmission parts like gear wheels, pinions and crown wheels. Case hardening produces a carbon-rich surface and provides the parts with both enhanced hardness and fatigue life. However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in case hardening steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard <b>Machinability</b> <b>Test</b> which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a case hardening steel with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for case hardening steels, it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|E

Therefore, the optimum tool life among the executed cutting trails was identified according to minimum length and depth of the crater wear. The profile measurements showed the formation of new geometries for the worn cutting edges due to adhesion and abrasion wear and the cutting parameters. The formation of the built-up edge was observed on the rake face of the cutting tool. The microstructure of the built-up edge was investigated using SEM. The built-up edge was found to have the austenite shear lamellar structure which is identical to the formed shear lamellae of the produced chip...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Cast aluminium-silicon alloys containing graphite particles are reported to offer the potential for use as bearing and cylinder block materials due to low friction and wear characteristics, good thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. However, a fundamental problem exists in dispersing graphite particles because liquid aluminium alloys do not wet graphite and so particles are rejected by the melt. The first section consists of a literature survey which examines the potential for graphite aluminium alloys, and reviews various methods for dispersing graphite particles. The potential {{for the use of}} recently developed methods of casting semi-solid alloys as a means of retaining graphite particles in melts is then considered. The second section reports on an investigation into the production of aluminium-silicon alloys which contain graphite particles and an evaluation of the mechanical and tribological properties of the composites produced with various silicon and graphite contents. Processing semisolid alloys produced an even dispersion of graphite particles without segregation, agglomeration or rejection. Solidification under pressure (squeeze casting) was used to optimise the mechanical properties of the composites. The evaluation of mechanical and tribological properties showed that strength and ductility were reduced in alloys which contained graphite. Wear tests showed that graphite additions provided increased load carrying capacity, reduced coefficient of friction, reduced steady running temperature and reduced damage to mating components. There was no evidence of a deterioration in corrosion from corrosion <b>tests</b> and <b>machinability</b> <b>tests</b> showed that <b>machinability</b> was greatly improved by the addition of graphite particles...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanical}} properties of bulk single-phase γ-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 ceramic are reported. γ-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 exhibits low shear modulus, excellent damage tolerance, and thus {{has a good}} machinability ready for metal working tools. To understand the underlying mechanism of <b>machinability,</b> drilling <b>test,</b> Hertzian contact test, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation are employed. Hertzian contact test demonstrates that γ-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 is a "quasi-plastic" ceramic and the intrinsically weak interfaces contribute to its machinability. Crystal structure characteristics and DFT calculations of γ-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 suggest that some weakly bonded planes, which involve Y-O bonds {{that can be easily}} broken, are the sources of the low shear deformation resistance and good machinability...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of graphite particles in graphite containing copper alloy was further improved very significantly using several procedures and technological modifications. The developed techniques attacked the graphite distribution problem in two ways. Realizing that clustering of very fine (5 um) graphite particles {{is one of}} the two major problems, a pretreatment process has been developed using aluminum powders to deagglomerate graphite particles. Along with this, a two-stage stirring technique was used to first incorporate and then to distribute uniformly the deagglomerated particles in the melt. During this year, based on these developments, several components were cast to evaluate the castability of Cu alloy-graphite melts. In addition, <b>machinability</b> <b>tests</b> were done to clearly established that addition of graphite particles improve the machinability of copper MMC alloys over and above that of monolithic copper alloys. The results show that the machining chip sizes and cutting forces of Cu alloys containing graphite particles are smaller than these of the corresponding monolithic Cu alloys. This clearly establishes that the presence of graphite particles in copper alloy improves the machinability in a fashion similar to lead additions to copper alloys. Centrifugal casting of shapes of different sizes appear to be a very attractive method for casting graphite containing copper alloys, since all the graphite particles (regardless of their distribution in the melt) are forced to segregate to the inner periphery of the castings where they impart a very desirable solid lubrication property for bushing and bearing use. A very large number of cylindrical elements of lead bearing copper alloys are now used for similar bearing bushing applications and the manufacturers of these type of bearings are under safety and health hazard pressure to remove lead. This year several parameters for centrifugal casting of copper graphite alloys have been established...|$|R
40|$|Conventional <b>machinability</b> <b>testing</b> {{requires}} {{large numbers}} of workpiece specimens. The difficulty is evaluating the machinability rating of an unknown and newly produced work material. A new method, proposed in this paper, is to face mill an end face of a cylindrical workpiece. The (VT) ^n=C curve is then determined from the data. Using this curve a machinability rating for the work material can be found. This method uses 85 % of the workpiece for chip making as compared to 45 % with conventional methods. From face milling a JIS S 45 C steel bar, the exponent n {{is found to be}} 0. 35. This value is satisfactory when compared with the value obtained by using the conventional method. Using these techniques a subsequent investigation was conducted using JIS S 12 C. Materials' properties were varied by changing the chemical composition and heat treatment. After the test runs, the following conclusions were reached : 1) A small workpiece diameter (up to 2. 5 cm) can be used without altering resutlts. It should be noted that homogeneous properties of the workpiece remain essential. 2) There is little change in chip thickness, when a 5. 5 cm diameter workpiece is cut with 25 cm milling cutter, since the centers of the two elements coincide. 3) Wear pattern on the tool face is rectangular in form, and the repeatability of the wear progress is very high. We conclude that error in measuring the wearland is small, even when observed by different operators. 4) A graph of cutting time vs. wearland is a straight line; on running several tests under identical conditions, the VT curve is similar, even though a wearland of 0. 2 mm or 0. 3 mm is chosen as the tool life criterion. The employment of a small workpiece does provide a VT curve and analysis is possible. 5) Besides machinability evaluation of a material, this method is also appropriate to study tool chipping and tool wear...|$|R
40|$|Mould steels {{are mainly}} {{employed}} in moulding of plastic products, {{and also some}} metals with low melting temperature such as magnesium alloys. The ever-growing usage of plastics in the industry, especially the automotive industry, and in everyday life, has increased the utilization of mould steels. Of all properties of these steels, machinability has the highest practical and economic importance as it covers over 60 % {{of the cost of}} the mould making process. Due to the more practical efficiency and shorter lead time, the use of the mould steels in prehardened condition has become more popular over traditional rough machining in the soft annealed state followed by post-roughening hardening and final machining. The present study is concerned with the influence of microstructure on the machinability of prehardened mould steels at a hardness level of around 40 HRC. The studied materials were some popular commercial mould steels and the experimental methods were chosen with consideration to industrial practices and demands. Also, the comparison of machinability and other properties was conducted at identical hardness, with the help of proper heat treatments and material batches. In addition to machinability, the mechanical properties of the studied materials were examined as well. Screening of 10 different plastic mould steels in <b>machinability</b> <b>tests,</b> two milling and two drilling, showed a considerable difference when ranking the machinability of the materials. The precipitation hardened steels exhibited a higher drillability than the quenched and tempered steels. The machinability of Uddeholm Impax HH (a modified AISI P 20) and Uddeholm Nimax, hardened to a similar hardness with and without heat treatment, respectively, was compared with respect to tool life, cutting force and cutting temperature. Uddeholm Nimax showed a better machinability, with a longer tool life and lower cutting force although its cutting temperature was a little higher, beside superior mechanical properties. Furthermore, the effect of some microstructural features, e. g. martensite packet size, carbide morphology and retained austenite, on the machinability was examined in Uddeholm Impax HH. The results showed an improved machinability with longer tool life and a somewhat lower cutting force in the steel variant with smaller martensite packet size. In addition, retained austenite in the microstructure of a bainitic (austempered) variant deteriorated its machinability. Moreover, a variant which contained spheriodized carbides exhibited superior machinability over other heat treated variants with more plate-like carbides...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} investigation of the machinability assessment when end milling tool steel (Din 1. 2311) BHN 300. The tool steel is a pre-hardened steel and it is widely used for molds or dies in the injection moulding industry. It is also classified as AIS 1 grade P 20 mold steel. The objective of this assessment is to generate reliable machining data in terms of tool life, cutting force and surface finish in relation to cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. During this research, cutting tests were carried by using the both the design of experiment and one-variable-at-a-time experimental techniques. Various cutting tools were used for the different tests including uncoated high speed steel, coated high speed steel, uncoated cemented carbide and coated cemented carbide. The results of these tests were plotted as graphs in order to assess the differences between the different tools. From these <b>machinability</b> assessment <b>tests,</b> a cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut range for the material can be determined and the optimum cutting conditions chosen, including economic production rate or maximum production rate for the end milling process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe spindle {{rotational}} speed fluctuates during milling due to intermittent cutting forces applied to the spindle, but the speed effect when machining with a relatively large cutter at low cutting speeds is still not clear. The focus {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of spindle servomotor dynamic characteristics on milling processes at various {{rotational speed}}s. Based on the simulation and experimental studies, it was found that the cutting speed fluctuation is not negligible at low operation speeds and that the spindle servomotor dynamics affect the machining process and tool life. Thus, it was concluded that the spindle dynamics have to be carefully evaluated and chosen when <b>testing</b> <b>machinability</b> of metals, especially low rotational milling applications typically required for machining of difficult-to-cut materials...|$|R
