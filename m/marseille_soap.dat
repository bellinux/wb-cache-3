2500|$|Soaps are {{derivatives}} of fatty acids. Traditionally {{they have}} been made from triglycerides (oils and fats). Triglyceride is the chemical name for the triesters of fatty acids and glycerin. Tallow, i.e., rendered beef fat, is the most available triglyceride from animals. Its saponified product is called sodium tallowate. Typical vegetable oils used in soap making are palm oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and laurel oil. Each species offers quite different fatty acid content and hence, results in soaps of distinct feel. The seed oils give softer but milder soaps. Soap made from pure olive oil is sometimes called Castile soap or <b>Marseille</b> <b>soap,</b> and is reputed for being extra mild. The term [...] "Castile" [...] is also sometimes applied to soaps from a mixture of oils, but {{a high percentage of}} olive oil.|$|E

50|$|Hard soap or {{curd soap}} {{is a kind}} of soap; {{examples}} are Aleppo soap, Castile soap, and <b>Marseille</b> <b>soap</b> or savon de Marseille. During the preparation of the soap, common salt (sodium chloride) is added to the liquid soap mass. This leads to the soap mass separating from glycerin, resulting in a harder soap. It can also be made using sodium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|Today {{there are}} two main {{varieties}} of <b>Marseille</b> <b>soap,</b> a greenish hued made with olive oil and a white made of palm oil or a palm and copra oil mixture. Originally sold only in 5 kg and 20 kg blocks, today they come in sizes between 300 g and 1 kg, though larger sizes are often available, some up to 40 kg.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marseille</b> <b>soap</b> [...] or Savon de Marseille is a {{traditional}} hard soap made from vegetable oils that has been produced around Marseille, France, for about 600 years. The first documented soapmaker was recorded there in about 1370. By 1688, Louis XIV introduced regulations in the Edict of Colbert limiting {{the use of the}} name savon de Marseille to olive oil based soaps. [...] The law has since been amended to allow other vegetable oils to be used.|$|E

30|$|After washing with <b>Marseille</b> <b>soap,</b> cotton, {{linen and}} silk {{textiles}} were dyed {{according to a}} modern version [3] of Napier’s recipe [15]. The tissues were soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of iron nitrate (FeIII(NO 3) 3.9 H 2 O, 7.65 g in 1 L water). After wringing, they were immersed in a solution of 7.56 g potassium hexacyanoferrate (K 4 FeIICN 6) and 1.9 mL of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4, 0.4 M) in 1 L of water. This two-step immersion procedure was then repeated before soaking the clothes 2 or 3 minutes in a solution of aluminum sulphate (0.95 g in 1 L of water) in order to fix the dying. Finally, clothes were rinsed in water and dried at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Hand washing {{has been}} {{considered}} a measure of personal hygiene for centuries and {{it is known that}} an improper hand hygiene by healthcare workers is responsible for about 40 % of nosocomial infections. Therefore, surgical hand preparation is a critical element for healthcare safety in order to reduce microbial contamination of  surgical wound in case of non detected break of the gloves. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy three antiseptics: Povi-iodine scrub; EPG (Ethanol, Hydrogen Peroxide, Glycerol, recommended by WHO), and common <b>marseille</b> <b>soap</b> type in a liquid formulation. METHODS It was designed a randomized, double-blind, single-center study conducted in the University Hospital of Messina, from January to June 2013. We asked operators to put the fingertips of their right hand (if not left-handed) for one minute on the PCA medium, before washing with the three types of antiseptics, and after washing and drying. Drying was made using sterile gauzes or disposable wipes. Then, we measured the number of colony forming units per mL (CFU/mL) and calculated the percentage of microbial load reduction. RESULTS 211 samples have been considered for statistical analysis: in 42 samples, in fact, initial microbial load was lower than after washing. Washing with EPG reduced CFU/ml from  a mean of 38, 9 to 4, 1 (86, 5 % reduction), washing with povi-iodine scrub from 59, 55 to 12, 9 (75, 9 % reduction) and washing with <b>Marseille</b> <b>soap</b> from 47, 26 to 12, 7 (64, 3 % reduction). CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that washing with EPG has superior efficacy in CFU reduction. Antiseptic hand washing, however, cannot be considered the only measure to reduce infections: the anomaly of some results (initial microbial load lower than after washing)   demonstrates that drying is an essential phase in the presurgical preparation. Therefore, hand hygiene must be part of a more complex strategy of surveillance and control of nosocomial infection...|$|E
