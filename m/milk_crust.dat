40|$|The {{protective}} {{mechanisms of}} whey protein isolate (WPI), trehalose, lactose, and skim milk on Lactobacillus plantarum A 17 during convective droplet drying has been explored. A single droplet drying technique {{was used to}} monitor cell survival, droplet temperature and corresponding changes in mass. WPI and skim milk provided the highest protection amongst the materials tested. In situ analysis of the intermediate stage of drying revealed that for WPI and skim <b>milk,</b> <b>crust</b> formation reduces the rate of sudden temperature increase thereby imparting less stress on the cells. Irreversible denaturation of the WPI components might have {{also contributed to the}} protection of the cells. Skim milk, however, &# 039;loses&# 039; the protective behaviour towards the latter stages of drying. This indicates that the concentration of the WPI components could be another possible factor determining the sustained protective behaviour during the later stages of drying when the moisture content is low...|$|E
6000|$|Biddy {{was waiting}} for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new <b>milk</b> and a <b>crust</b> of bread. [...] "Biddy," [...] said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, [...] "I am not angry, but I am hurt." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{appetite}} did {{not proceed}} from callousness. Mr Verloc had not eaten any breakfast that day. He {{had left his}} home fasting. Not being an energetic man, he found his resolution in nervous excitement, which seemed to hold him mainly by the throat. He could not have swallowed anything solid. Michaelis’ cottage was as destitute of provisions as the cell of a prisoner. The ticket-of-leave apostle lived on a little <b>milk</b> and <b>crusts</b> of stale bread. Moreover, when Mr Verloc arrived he had already gone upstairs after his frugal meal. Absorbed in the toil and delight of literary composition, he had not even answered Mr Verloc’s shout up the little staircase.|$|R
5|$|They become {{tired of}} each other's company, {{and of the}} food they have brought. They come to a ruinous summer pasture village, and eat local food: boiled <b>milk,</b> the yellow <b>crust</b> that forms on cream, and fresh bread. They catch sight of their goal, Mir Samir. They find tracks of ibex and wolf. One of their drivers catches a snowcock by running after it.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, I {{had little}} time at my disposal. Messieurs Sharpe and Fowler had left the night before in the persuasion that I was a liar of the first magnitude; the genial belief brought them aboard again with the {{earliest}} opportunity, proffering help to one who had proved how little he required it, and hospitality to so respectable a character. I had business to mind, I had some need both of assistance and diversion; I liked Fowler--I don't know why; and in short, I let them do with me as they desired. No creditor intervening, I spent {{the first half of}} the day inquiring into the conditions of the tea and silk market under the auspices of Sharpe; lunched with him in a private apartment at the Hawaiian Hotel--for Sharpe was a teetotaler in public; and about four in the afternoon was delivered into the hands of Fowler. This gentleman owned a bungalow on the Waikiki beach; and there, in company with certain young bloods of Honolulu, I was entertained to a sea-bathe, indiscriminate cocktails, a dinner, a hula-hula, and (to round off the night) poker and assorted liquors. To lose money in the small hours to pale intoxicated youth has always appeared to me a pleasure overrated. In my then frame of mind, I confess I found it even delightful; put up my money (or rather my creditors') and put down Fowler's champagne with equal avidity and success; and awoke the next morning to a mild headache and the rather agreeable lees of the last night's excitement. The young bloods, many of whom were still far from sober, had taken the kitchen into their own hands, vice the Chinaman deposed; and since each was engaged upon a dish of his own, and none had the least scruple in demolishing his neighbour's handiwork, I became early convinced that many eggs would be broken and few omelets made. The discovery of a jug of <b>milk</b> and a <b>crust</b> of bread enabled me to stay my appetite; and since it was Sunday, when no business could be done, and the festivities were to be renewed that night in the abode of Fowler, it occurred to me to slip silently away and enjoy some air and solitude.|$|R
