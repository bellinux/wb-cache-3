40|$|The de-facto {{standard}} STL {{file format}} has served the rapid prototyping community {{for over two}} decades, but falls short {{with the advent of}} new technological developments such as the ability to handle multiple and graded materials, specify volumetric digital inkjet patterns and surface colors. We study a variety of requirements for additive fabrication technologies and propose a new compact XML-based file format. The new Additive <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>File</b> (AMF) format allows the resolution-independent specification of geometry and material properties. Regions may be defined geometrically either using a triangle mesh, using functional representations, or through a voxel bitmap. Each region is associated with a material, which may be defined as a base (single) material or hierarchically by a combination of other materials, either functionally (enabling smooth gradients) or voxel-wise (for arbitrary microstructure). Files can be self-contained or refer to external or online material libraries. With a simple conversion, the AMF file format is both forward and backwards compatible with the current standard STL format, and the flexibility of the XML structure enables additional features to be adopted as needed by CAD programs and future additive manufacturing processes.

40|$|Purpose - In {{the newly}} {{released}} ASTM standard specification for additive <b>manufacturing</b> <b>file</b> (AMF) format - version 1. 1 - Hermite curve-based interpolation {{is used to}} refine input triangles to generate denser mesh with smoother geometry. This paper aims to study the problems of constructing smooth geometry based on Hermite interpolation on curves and proposes a solution to overcome these problems. Design/methodology/approach - A formulation using triangular Bezier patch is proposed to generate smooth geometry from input polygonal models. Different configurations on the boundary curves in the formulation are analyzed to further enrich this formulation. Findings - The study shows that the formulation given in the AMF format (version 1. 1) {{can lead to the}} problems of inconsistent normals and undefined end-tangents. Research limitations/implications - The scheme has requirements on the input normals of a model, only C 0 interpolation can be generated on those cases with less-proper input. Originality/value - To overcome the problems of smooth geometry generation in the AMF format, the authors propose an enriched scheme for computing smooth geometry by using triangular Bezier patch. For the configurations with less-proper input, the authors adopt the Boolean sum and the Nielson's point-opposite edge interpolation for triangular Coons patch to generate the smooth geometry as a C 0 interpolant.

40|$|International audienceShort abstract: The {{implementation}} of Additive Manufacturing (AM) digital flow and {{product data management}} system rely more on data formats and standards that nowadays convey Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) information directly in the 3 D model. The consideration of geometric deviations and variations {{is an important issue}} for tolerancing and geometric quality assessment in AM through product and manufacturing information (PMI). This paper reviews current challenges of geometric models and standard formats for AM technologies, which largely impede its advancement. Two criteria to enhance AM geometric models and standards are presented in this paper: tolerancing and compatibility of PMI. The analysis presented in this paper highlights that STEP standard can be a good basis for future research to integrate geometric models and standards for AM. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been applied to the automotive, aerospace and medical industries for many years [1 - 2]. However, it is a difficult technology for AM that geometric models describe precision and accuracy of product shape, dimensioning and tolerancing. Geometric models have become ubiquitous and offered essential and different tools for the digital product development [3]. In the 1960 s Herbert Voelker considered the possibilities of using computer-aided machine to operate machine through CAD geometry. In the 1970 s mathematical tools for describing 3 D solid modelling had been invented in the early algorithms [4]. At present, geometric deviation has become a major issue on the tolerancing research [5]. Skin model concept has been applied to describe tolerancing representation and analysis [6]. Standards {{play an important role in}} the adoption of many technologies. Some of standardized formats include Stereo Lithography (STL), Additive <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>File</b> (AFM) and Standard for Exchange Product (STEP) [7 - 8]. The theoretical geometrical model has been developed to consider geometric deviations [9]. And the developing and using standards (i. e. ASTM AMF, 3 MF, ISO 10303 STEP) and tolerances (ASME Y 14) [10 - 11] have integrated information related to AM process [12]. In order to realise this AM process: design, simulation, build plan, monitoring and control and verification, standard organizations have begun to establish AM file format for data exchange[4]. The design and manufacturing of high performance product may lead to an inevitable need for geometric deviations and tolerancing management [13 - 14]. The geometric tolerancing models have been proposed [15 - 18]. Tolerancing analysis has been used in predicting inevitable geometric deviations on the function and quality of product [19]. Skin model shapes can extract valuable information for geometric deviation [20]. Product manufacturing information (PMI) includes the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) [21]. These PMI standards, such as ISO TC 213, ASME Y 14. 5, can define tolerancing [22]. Next sections will highlight challenges of geometric models and standards for AM technologies. These challenges mainly focus on two issues: geometric deviations and tolerancing management, and refer to two criteria: tolerancing and compatibility with PMI for AM formats. In section 3, skin model is introduced, and PMI standard can define tolerancing in AM systems. In section 4, different AM standards (i. e. STL, AMF, STEP) are compared and we emphasize on STEP in future works. In section 5, a conclusion and outlook are given...|$|E

The NanoWalker {{is an example}} of such a robot where a large amount of electronics must be embedded in the smallest possible space. To make a space-efficient implementation, electronic chips are mounted using flip chip technology on a pre-bumped flexible printed circuit (FPC). A three dimensional structure is obtained by mounting the FPC vertically in a triangular fashion above a tripod built with three small piezo-actuated legs used for the walking and rotational motions. Advanced computer aided design (CAD) systems are used for the design and to generate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>files.</b> Unlike other commercial products such as cellular phones, watches, pagers, cameras, and disk drives that use flip chip technology to achieve the smallest form factor, the assembly process of the NanoWalker is directly dependent on other characteristics of the system. Minimization of coupling noises through proper FPC layout and die placement within temperature constraints due to the proximity of sensitive instrument was a critical factor. The effect ofvibration caused by the piezo-actuators and the weight of each die were also other important issues to consider to determine the final placement in order to maintain proper sub-atomic motion behavior...|$|R

In this paper through optimizing the exiting algorithms, size of the files and memory usage of computers to process them will be reduced. In spite of type and extent of the errors in STL files, the tail-to-head searching method and analysis of the nearest distance between tails and heads techniques were used.
