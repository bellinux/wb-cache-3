30|$|Though the {{high-order}} superdirectivity theory {{proposed in}} recent years is attractive, it is hard to implement in practice due to its poor robustness to small random array errors. Hence, in this paper, we present two robust designs of high-order superdirectivity for circular arrays with gain and phase errors. Firstly, we study on the sensitivity function of the high-order superdirectivity and give an alternative solution for a robust superdirective beamformer based on sensitivity function constraint. This method could achieve an arbitrary compromise between directivity and robustness, so it is more flexible and applicable than the existing higher-order truncation method. Although it does not improve on computational complexity or performance with respect to the second-order cone programming obviously, it could lay the foundation for the following robust design method. Then, considering the fact that different eigenbeams correspond to different eigenvalues, we study the method of diagonal loading with variable factors in detail, and further improve the performance of the former sensitivity function constrained <b>method</b> <b>by</b> loading <b>variable</b> factors to different eigenbeams, which results in better performance and greater flexibility in making a compromise. We also show that this proposed loading variable factors method can achieve an equivalent result to the higher-order truncation <b>method</b> <b>by</b> setting proper factors. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the above two methods, especially the performance improvement of the loading variable factors method.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to explore the {{possibility}} of improving DoD cost estimation <b>methods</b> <b>by</b> including explanatory <b>variables</b> that capture the coordination and motivation {{problems associated with the}} program. Accordingly, we note that cost overruns remain a well documented and significant problem for DoD, and consider why that problem continues. We review the current state (and limitations) of DoD cost estimation methodology and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). We then consider reasons why including TCE explanatory variables might (or might not) improve cost estimation. To explore the potential contribution of TCE variables, we considered two cases of Army surface-to-surface missiles: Javelin and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS); we also analyzed standard program cost data bases for indications of transaction costs. While the case studies indicated that TCE variables have promise in improving the explanatory power of cost estimates, the standard data bases are poorly designed (at best) to shed light on program transaction costs. Our policy conclusion is that the complete costs of major transactions together with key characteristics of the market, need to be captured and understood in order to properly anticipate the full costs of major defense acquisition programs...|$|R
