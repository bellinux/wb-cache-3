40|$|Laser {{leveling}} is {{an application}} of laser forming. Laser leveling of a sheet metal is a plastic process caused by thermal stresses which are produced in the sheet by laser irradiation. In this paper, a sphereical distortion on a sheet metal is leveled by laser irradiation. As {{a model of a}} circular distortion, the dsitortion is intentionally introduced on the sheet metal by pressing a steel ball of 25 mm radius against it. As work <b>materials,</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> whose thickness is 0. 6 mm are used. Laser beam is radially irradiated at the center of circular distortion for leveling the distorted sheet metal. Continuous CO 2 laser beam is used and its power is changed at the range of 80 W ∼ 200 W under a constant scanning speed of 2 mm/s. After laser irradiation, a distortion of about 400 µm hight becomes almost flat without melting a sheet metal...|$|R

One potential big issue however is the fact that the exact same design fire is recommended by authorities in similar building types despite the fact that some building characteristics, such as building material, can differ greatly. This paper focused on investigating several key characteristics of a building (building material, openings, room floor area size and ceiling height) and its effect on the design fire using computational fluid dynamics.

However, using thermally thin <b>materials</b> (<b>steel</b> <b>sheet)</b> or <b>materials</b> with large heat storing capacity (concrete) very little change was seen on the growth rate or maximum heat release rate.

This is of great importance when dealing with durability: due to the softness of such a support, the pavement is subjected to considerable strains that may generate top-down cracks in the layer at right angles of the orthotropic plate stiffeners and shear cracks at the interface between pavement and steel.

The related FPR strengthening projects have been dramatically increased all over the world. This growth rate has started from a couple of projects to thousands during last decade. The EMPA Switzerland Institute can be mentioned as the primary researchers in the field of FPR strengthening. The researches were performed on CFRP strengthened RC beams in 1984. The most important advantages of using FRP sheets are the high ratio of resistance to weight and also high ratio of resistance to corrosion (Jankowiak 2012). The first quality would cause the ease of application in place and reduction of the wage cost. The second characteristic would cause the durability of execution. Different parts of strengthened structures with FRP systems with the forms of outer coverage are: beams, columns, walls, joints, chimneys, circular arches, tunnels, bins, pipes, and trusses. FRP coverage as an alternative for other strengthening strategies such as using <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> and ducts around concrete columns has been invented. The FRP coverage has been developed {{for the first time in}} 1980 s in Japan and Europe for improvement of concrete structures. Nowadays, FRP systems have been used as <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> alternatives. FRP sheets are 2 – 10 times stronger than <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> while they weigh 20 % of <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> (Ahmad and van Gernert 1999). The limitations to use this sort of materials in civil engineering applications are just because of high cost. FRP composites are so resistant against the corrosion, salty, and alkali environment. Nowadays, FRP composites have been topic of wide spread studies as alternatives of steel bars and pre-stressed cables. The connection of <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to tensile part of concrete pieces by epoxy resins to enhance bending strength of such pieces is a normal and durable method.

40|$|Planar {{anisotropy}} and cup-drawing {{behavior were}} investigated for high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> containing different volume fractions of martensite. Macrotexture analysis using XRD {{was conducted to}} capture the effect of crystallographic orientation on the planar anisotropy of high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> A phenomenological yield function, Yld 96, which accounts for the anisotropy of yield stress and r-values, was implemented into ABAQUS using the user subroutine UMAT. Cup drawing of high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> was simulated using the FEM code. The profiles of earing and thickness strain were compared with the experimentally measured results...|$|R
40|$|Laser-arc hybrid welding {{combines}} the laser and arc welding processes to provide advantages {{not found in}} either. This process can weld lapped <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> that have a larger gap than is possible with laser welding. Blowholes form when lap-welding zinc-coated <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> because of the zinc that is vaporized. The laser-arc hybrid welding proc-ess can lap-weld zinc-coated <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> without causing blowholes. The welding speed of laser-arc hybrid welding is nearly equivalent to that of laser welding. Laser-arc hybrid welding produces high-quality lap joints and is ideal for assembly welding of automotive parts...|$|R
