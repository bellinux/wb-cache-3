25|$|Grouper {{are often}} found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They {{can be quite}} large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy {{crushing}} tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible to pull them out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant <b>morays</b> in hunting.|$|E

60|$|But, {{in a lower}} rank to these, {{there were}} found {{individuals}} of an inferior description, the common peasantry of the Highland country, who, although they did not {{allow themselves to be}} so called, and claimed often, with apparent truth, to be of more ancient descent than the masters whom they served, bore, nevertheless, the livery of extreme penury, being indifferently accoutred, and worse armed, half naked, stinted in growth, and miserable in aspect. Each important clan had some of those Helots attached to them: thus, the MacCouls, though tracing their descent from Comhal, the father of Finn or Fingal, were a sort of Gibeonites, or hereditary servants to the Stewarts of Appin; the Macbeths, descended from the unhappy monarch of that name, were subjects to the <b>Morays</b> and clan Donnochy, or Robertsons of Athole; and many other examples might be given, {{were it not for the}} risk of hurting any pride of clanship which may yet be left, and thereby drawing a Highland tempest into the shop of my publisher. Now these same Helots, though forced into the field by the arbitrary authority of the chieftains under whom they hewed wood and drew water, were in general very sparingly fed, ill dressed, and worse armed. The latter circumstance was indeed owing chiefly to the general disarming act, which had been carried into effect ostensibly through the whole Highlands, although most of the chieftains contrived to elude its influence by retaining the weapons of their own immediate clansmen, and delivering up those of less value, which they collected from these inferior satellites. It followed, as a matter of course, that, as we have already hinted, many of these poor fellows were brought to the field in a very wretched condition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Morays</b> are {{frequently}} {{thought of as}} particularly vicious or ill-tempered animals. In truth, <b>morays</b> hide from humans in crevices and would rather flee than fight. They are shy and secretive, and attack humans only in self-defense or mistaken identity. Most attacks stem from disruption of a moray's burrow (to which they do react strongly), but an increasing number also occur during hand feeding of <b>morays</b> by divers, an activity often used by dive companies to attract tourists. <b>Morays</b> have poor vision and rely mostly on their acute sense of smell, making distinguishing between fingers and held food difficult; numerous divers have lost fingers while attempting hand feedings, so the hand feeding of moray eels has been banned in some locations, including the Great Barrier Reef. The moray's rear-hooked teeth and primitive but strong bite mechanism also makes bites on humans more severe, as the eel cannot release its grip, even in death, and must be manually pried off. While the majority are not believed to be venomous, circumstantial evidence suggests a few species may be.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{have also}} {{discovered}} that groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri) and giant moray eels (Gymnothorax javanicus) provide compelling evidence for interspecific cooperative hunting. [...] Groupers visit moray eels at their resting places and provide visual signals (such as a head shake) to engage <b>morays</b> in the hunt. These associations are non-random and appear to be motivated by the hunger level of the groupers. Groupers were able to capture prey five times more quickly with <b>morays</b> present because the eels could sneak through crevices and corner prey items; additionally, <b>morays</b> that hunted alone were never successful {{because they did not}} have a grouper present to lead them to the prey. Thus, the hunting success of groupers and giant moray eels is greater for both species than when hunting alone.|$|E

50|$|Reef-associated roving coralgroupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) {{have been}} {{observed}} to recruit giant <b>morays</b> to join them in hunting for food.

50|$|The <b>Morays</b> are {{the next}} step in marine warfare, {{evolving}} from the most elite of the Eel division.
