A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually.

25|$|Meat can {{be cooked}} in boiling oil, {{typically}} by shallow frying, although deep frying may be used, often for meat enrobed with breadcrumbs as in milanesas. Larger pieces such as steaks may be cooked this way, or meat may be cut smaller as in stir frying, typically an Asian way of cooking: cooking oil with flavorings such as garlic, ginger and onions {{is put in}} a very hot wok. Then small pieces of meat are added, followed by ingredients which cook more quickly, such as <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The dish is ready when the ingredients are 'just cooked'.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{volatile}} profiles of a <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetable</b> puree comprised of tomato and carrot due to different thermo-mechanical process conditions has been thoroughly investigated using an untargeted GC–MS chemical fingerprinting approach.

This work showed the potential of different process types to generate distinct headspace profiles of a mixed tomato–carrot system. This consciousness can be a starting point for more targeted tailoring of the flavour of mixed tomato–carrot products. status: publishe...|$|R

Moisture, temperature, pH, ash content, C:N ratios, and the concentrations of creosote in the compost systems were monitored monthly.

Temperature rose to about 45 degreesC in the cattle manure compost within two months of incubation while temperature in the control and vegetable waste remained below 30 degreesC until the fourth month. Creosote concentration was reduced by 17 % in the control and by more than 99 % in the cattle manure and vegetable waste compost after composting. The rate of reduction in concentration in the <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste compost was initially lower than in the cattle manure compost. The reduction rate became similar in later months with only small differences {{towards the end of the}} composting.
