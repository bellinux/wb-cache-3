5|$|Because both <b>methanol</b> {{and carbon}} {{monoxide}} are commodity raw materials, <b>methanol</b> carbonylation long {{appeared to be}} attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a <b>methanol</b> carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial <b>methanol</b> carbonylation process, which used a cobalt catalyst, was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based catalyst (cis−−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed <b>methanol</b> carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst (−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. This iridium-catalyzed Cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in <b>methanol.</b> Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on <b>methanol.</b> In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated <b>methanol</b> fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. <b>Methanol</b> was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to <b>methanol.</b> The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as catalysts in the Cativa process for carbonylation of <b>methanol</b> to produce acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} to be {{competitive}} with <b>methanol</b> carbonylation for smaller plants (100–250kt/a), depending on the local price of ethylene.|$|E
5|$|Iceland's {{abundant}} {{geothermal energy}} has also enabled renewable energy initiatives, such as Carbon Recycling International's carbon dioxide to <b>methanol</b> fuel process, which {{could help reduce}} Iceland's dependence on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{microwave}} synthetic {{methods have}} also been reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after reaction of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in <b>methanol</b> following work-up with methanolic ammonium hexafluorophosphate; the reaction yield exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds of exposure to microwave radiation.|$|E
5|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission by India {{is searching}} for methane in the atmosphere, while the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, {{launched}} in 2016, would further study the methane {{as well as its}} decomposition products, such as formaldehyde and <b>methanol.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{global demand}} for acetic acid is about 6.5 {{million metric tons}} per year (Mt/a), of which {{approximately}} 1.5Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from <b>methanol.</b> Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol.|$|E
5|$|Another {{family of}} {{persistent}} carbenes {{are based on}} the 1,2,4-triazole ring, with the unfilled orbitals in carbon 5 of this ring. The triazol-5-ylidenes pictured below were first prepared by Enders and co-workers by vacuum pyrolysis through loss of <b>methanol</b> from 2-methoxytriazoles. Only a limited range of these molecules have been reported, with the triphenyl substituted molecule being commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the <b>methanol</b> dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the commercialization}} of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was {{produced}} by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of <b>methanol.</b> The acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, <b>methanol</b> and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{catalysts}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} industrial processes, notably in catalytic carbonylation of <b>methanol</b> to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process. It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds, a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers. Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as <b>methanol,</b> gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, <b>methanol</b> and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure <b>methanol</b> {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, <b>methanol</b> does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, <b>Methanol</b> is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the <b>methanol</b> vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use <b>methanol</b> as the primary fuel source. <b>Methanol</b> is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on <b>methanol.</b> As a fuel for mud racers, <b>methanol</b> mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> {{is readily}} {{biodegradable}} in both aerobic (oxygen present) and anaerobic (oxygen absent) environments. <b>Methanol</b> will not {{persist in the}} environment. The half-life for <b>methanol</b> in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives {{in the hundreds of}} days (such as benzene at 10–730 days). Since <b>methanol</b> is miscible with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.|$|E
25|$|Two large {{petrochemical}} {{plants are}} now the most important industrial activity in Waitara. The Waitara Valley plant is dedicated to production of <b>methanol</b> from natural gas (about 1500 tonnes per day). The Motunui plant, originally designed to produce synthetic petrol from <b>methanol</b> was modified to produce chemical grade <b>methanol</b> for export.|$|E
25|$|An {{effective}} treatment to prevent toxicity after <b>methanol</b> or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenase {{has a higher}} affinity for ethanol, thus preventing <b>methanol</b> from binding and acting as a substrate. Any remaining <b>methanol</b> will then have time to be excreted through the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|One potent {{congener}} is <b>methanol.</b> It {{is naturally}} formed in small quantities during fermentation {{and it can}} be accidentally concentrated by improper distillation techniques. Metabolism of <b>methanol</b> produces some extremely toxic compounds, such as formaldehyde and formic acid, which {{may play a role in}} the severity of hangover. Ethanol slows the conversion of <b>methanol</b> into its toxic metabolites so that most of the <b>methanol</b> can be excreted harmlessly in the breath and urine without forming its toxic metabolites. This may explain the temporary postponement of symptoms reported in the common remedy of drinking more alcohol to relieve hangover symptoms. Since <b>methanol</b> metabolism is effectively inhibited by consumption of alcohol, <b>methanol</b> accumulates during drinking and only begins to be metabolized once ethanol has been cleared. This delayed action makes it an attractive candidate explanation for delayed post-intoxication symptoms and correlations between <b>methanol</b> concentrations and the presence of hangover symptoms that have been found in studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> is {{poisonous}} to {{the central}} nervous system and may cause blindness, coma, and death. However, in small amounts, <b>methanol</b> is a natural endogenous compound found in normal, healthy human individuals, concluded by one study which found a mean of 4.5ppm in the exhaled breath of subjects. The mean endogenous <b>methanol</b> in humans of 0.45 g/d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit; one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g <b>methanol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was <b>methanol</b> (methyl alcohol). <b>Methanol</b> was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of <b>methanol</b> in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the <b>methanol</b> was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. <b>Methanol</b> also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced <b>methanol</b> as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to <b>methanol</b> and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> is {{produced}} naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria and is commonly present {{in small amounts}} in the environment. As a result, the atmosphere contains {{a small amount of}} <b>methanol</b> vapor. However, in only a few days, atmospheric <b>methanol</b> is oxidized by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water.|$|E
25|$|The European Fuel Quality Directive allows up to 3% <b>methanol</b> with {{an equal}} amount of {{cosolvent}} to be blended with gasoline sold in Europe. China uses more than one billion gallons of <b>methanol</b> per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for <b>methanol</b> fuels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> {{is mixed}} with water and {{injected}} into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power {{and a decrease in}} intake air temperature in a process known as water <b>methanol</b> injection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> is {{primarily}} used in making other chemicals. About 40% of <b>methanol</b> {{is converted to}} formaldehyde, and from there into products as diverse as plastics, plywood, paints, explosives, and permanent press textiles.|$|E
25|$|The <b>methanol</b> used in most {{biodiesel}} {{production processes}} is made using fossil fuel inputs. However, there are sources of renewable <b>methanol</b> made using carbon dioxide or biomass as feedstock, making their production processes free of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|Organic <b>methanol,</b> {{produced}} from wood or other organic materials (bioalcohol), {{has been suggested}} as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons. Low levels of <b>methanol</b> {{can be used in}} existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|PEM {{systems that}} use {{reformed}} <b>methanol</b> were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming <b>methanol,</b> i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however {{a very complicated}} process, that requires also purification from the carbon monoxide the reaction produces. A platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some carbon monoxide will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 parts per million. Furthermore, the start-up times of such a reformer reactor are of about half an hour. Alternatively, <b>methanol,</b> and some other biofuels can be fed to a PEM fuel cell directly without being reformed, thus making a direct <b>methanol</b> fuel cell (DMFC). These devices operate with limited success.|$|E
25|$|Direct <b>methanol</b> {{fuel cells}} {{do not require}} a reformer, but provide a lower energy density {{compared}} to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of ethanol and <b>methanol</b> over hydrogen. Alcohol fuel is a renewable resource.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methanol</b> fuel {{has been}} {{proposed}} for ground transportation. The chief advantage of a <b>methanol</b> economy is {{that it could be}} adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel.|$|E
25|$|Pure <b>methanol</b> {{has been}} used in open wheel auto racing since the mid-1960s. Unlike {{petroleum}} fires, <b>methanol</b> fires can be extinguished with plain water. A methanol-based fire burns invisibly, unlike gasoline, which burns with a visible flame. If a fire occurs on the track, there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers, but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression. The decision to permanently switch to <b>methanol</b> in American IndyCar racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the 1964 Indianapolis 500, which killed drivers Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald. In 2007 IndyCars switched from <b>methanol</b> to ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Deprotection: Camphorsulfonic acid, dicholoromethane, and <b>methanol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 3-carbon alcohol, {{propanol}} (C3H7OH), is {{not often}} used as a direct fuel source for petrol engines(unlike ethanol, <b>methanol</b> and butanol), with most being directed into use as a solvent. However, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen in some types of fuel cell; it can generate a higher voltage than <b>methanol,</b> which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells. However, since propanol is harder to produce than <b>methanol</b> (biologically OR from oil), methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol.|$|E
25|$|Conversion of {{vegetable}} oil to biodiesel is via a transesterification reaction, where the triglyceride {{is converted to}} the methyl ester plus glycerol. This is usually done using <b>methanol</b> and caustic or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical <b>methanol</b> without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical <b>methanol</b> for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka and his coworkers. This {{has the advantage of}} allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product {{does not need to be}} washed to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.|$|E
25|$|If ingested, {{alcohols}} (other than ethanol) such as <b>methanol,</b> propanol, and {{ethylene glycol}} metabolize into toxic aldehydes and acids, which cause potentially fatal metabolic acidosis. Thus, the commonly available alcohol solvent <b>methanol</b> can cause permanent blindness or death if ingested. The solvent 2-butoxyethanol, used in fracking fluids, can cause hypotension and metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of <b>methanol</b> {{poisoning}} {{have occurred}} due to contamination of drinking alcohol. This {{is more common}} in the developing world. In 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the United States. Those affected are often adult males. Outcomes may be good with early treatment. Toxicity to <b>methanol</b> was described as early as 1856.|$|E
