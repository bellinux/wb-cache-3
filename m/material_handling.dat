40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{discover}} whether on-site <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> should be performed in-house or out-sourced. This is done by studying visible and hidden costs related to <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and of the managers' awareness of these costs. Design/methodology/approach – The data have been gathered through 15 interviews, a number of short discussions on construction sites, and direct observations on six occasions in four housing projects in Scandinavia. Findings – Indirect and waste costs for <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> on construction sites are unknown and are often underestimated during budgeting, planning, scheduling and organizing construction projects. Practical implications – The short case-studies indicate that the benefits of out-sourcing on-site <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> outweigh the costs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine those {{occupational}} accidents at construction sites that are related to <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> as compared with all reportable occupational accidents at construction sites. The main concern is to define the kinds of accidents that occur in <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> The data were gathered from two sources: a large Finnish construction company and the database of reports of serious occupational accidents (Sammio). One third of all the reported accidents in the studied construction company occurred during materials transfer and 36 % of the absenteeism days resulted from these accidents. <b>Materials</b> <b>handling</b> thus caused more serious accidents than other work activities (t = - 2. 44, df = 351, p < 0. 005). Minor accidents were mostly due to over-exertion whereas serious accidents were mostly falling from a height and injuries caused by falling and collapsing objects. The manual transfer of materials caused most of the materials transfer accidents in the company and mechanical transfer most of the serious <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> accidents. Over-exertion can, therefore, be decreased by reducing manual <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> On the other hand, replacing manual transfers with mechanical transfers means that there arises a risk of serious accidents.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> requirements of production structures configured for Mass Customisation Manufacturing, the design of requisite <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing systems must encompass new conceptual properties. <b>Materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing systems with the capacity to support higher-level management systems would allow for mediated task allocation and structured vertical integration of these systems into existing manufacturing execution and management systems. Thus, a global objective in designing a <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing system, for such production configurations. {{is to provide a}} flexible system mechanism with minimal policy on system usage. With the recent developments in mobile robot technologies, due to various advancements in embedded system, computational, and communication infrastructures, mobile robot platforms can be developed that are robust and reliable, with operating structures incorporating bounded autonomy. With the addition of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> hardware, autonomous agent architectures, structured communication protocols and robotic software systems, these mobile robot platforms can provide viable solution mechanisms in realising real-time flexible <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in production environments facilitating Mass Customisation Manufacturing. This dissertation covers the research and development of a <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing system implementation architecture, for production environments facilitating Mass Customisation Manufacturing. The <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing task environment in such production structures is characterised in order to provide a well defined problem space for research purposes. A physical instance of a functional subset of the architecture is constructed consisting of a semi-autonomous mobile robot platform equipped with the infrastructure for <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and routing task execution.

25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E

25|$|Ternary {{eutectic}} chloride (T.E.C.) {{dry powder}} is a dry powder invented in 1959 by Lawrence H Cope, a research metallurgist {{working for the}} UK Atomic Energy Authority, and licensed to John Kerr Co. of England. It consists of a mixture of three powdered salts: sodium, potassium and barium chloride. T.E.C. forms an oxygen-excluding layer of molten salt on the metal's surface. Along with Met-L-X (sodium chloride), T.E.C {{has been reported to}} be one of the most effective agents (along with Met-L-X {sodium chloride}) for use on sodium, potassium, and NaK fires, and is used specifically on atomic metals like uranium and plutonium as it will not contaminate the valuable metal unlike other agents. T.E.C. is quite toxic, due to the barium chloride content, and for this reason is no longer used in the UK, and was never used in the US aside from radioactive <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> glove boxes, where its toxicity was not an issue due their confined nature. T.E.C. is still widely used in India, despite toxicity, while the West uses chiefly sodium chloride, graphite, and copper types of powder and considers T.E.C. obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} involves {{packets of}} light (photons) that originate from radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. Gamma rays {{are used for}} products that are too thick for treatment with electron beams. Every radioactive element gives rise to Gamma rays with specific energies characteristic of the source element, these rays have zero mass and no electrical charge. The ones used for food irradiation are able to penetrate through food products. The radioactive isotope radioisotope cobalt-60 is used as the source in all commercial scale gamma irradiation facilities. Gamma irradiation is most widely used technology because the deeper penetration of the gamma rays enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes (reducing the need for <b>material</b> <b>handling)</b> and it is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source. Cobalt-60 is bred from cobalt-59 using neutron irradiation in specifically designed nuclear reactors. In limited applications caesium-137, a less costly alternative recovered during the processing of spent nuclear fuel, {{is used as a}} radioactive source. Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring NRC intervention has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.|$|E

This work proposes to integrate the operation allocation and the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system selection problems in a flexible manufacturing system by extending the operation allocation model to include some aspects of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system design. The objective of the operation allocation model is to select a group of machines where {{the operations of the}} part types will be performed and then to assign those operations to the selected machines. The operation allocation model interfaces with the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model by providing input data {{in the form of the}} manufacturing operations to be performed at each machining center. The selection of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is centered on the matching of the parts visiting a machining center to perform a manufacturing operation and the abilities of the handling equipment to perform the required <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> functions of those part types. The objective is to select an optimal group of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equipment to be assigned to a cell.
