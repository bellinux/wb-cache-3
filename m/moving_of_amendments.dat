40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{drafting}} and operation of amending legislation {{in the light of}} two paradigms of statute law. Part One examines the paradigm which developed in Great Britain in the nineteenth century. That paradigm emphasized the fragmentary character of the statute law. Ilbert analysed the techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> and concluded in favour of the use <b>of</b> indirect <b>amendment</b> and against the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> Another paradigm <b>of</b> statute law developed in the United States, Canada and Australia in the nineteenth century. It emphasizes the potential coherence of the statute law and tries to realise this potential through statute revision and the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> The consequences <b>of</b> the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment</b> for the operation of amending enactments are examined. The thesis also considers the argument that the use of re-enactment as a technique <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> is undesirable because it opens up for parliamentary <b>amendment</b> more <b>of</b> the act proposed to be amended than do other techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

60|$|Adventures, {{according}} to the proverb, are to the adventurous. Quite as often they are to the non-adventurous, to the retiring, to the constitutionally timid. John James Abbleway had been endowed by Nature {{with the sort of}} disposition that instinctively avoids Carlist intrigues, slum crusades, the tracking of wounded wild beasts, and the <b>moving</b> <b>of</b> hostile <b>amendments</b> at political meetings. If a mad dog or a Mad Mullah had come his way he would have surrendered the way without hesitation. At school he had unwillingly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German tongue out of deference to the plainly-expressed wishes of a foreign-languages master, who, though he taught modern subjects, employed old-fashioned methods in driving his lessons home. It was this enforced familiarity with an important commercial language which thrust Abbleway in later years into strange lands where adventures were less easy to guard against than in the ordered atmosphere of an English country town. The firm that he worked for saw fit to send him one day on a prosaic business errand to the far city of Vienna, and, having sent him there, continued to keep him there, still engaged in humdrum affairs of commerce, but with the possibilities of romance and adventure, or even misadventure, jostling at his elbow. After {{two and a half years}} of exile, however, John James Abbleway had embarked on only one hazardous undertaking, and that was of a nature which would assuredly have overtaken him sooner or later if he had been leading a sheltered, stay-at-home existence at Dorking or Huntingdon. He fell placidly in love with a placidly lovable English girl, the sister of one of his commercial colleagues, who was improving her mind by a short trip to foreign parts, and in due course he was formally accepted as the young man she was engaged to. The further step by which she was to become Mrs. John Abbleway was to take place a twelvemonth hence in a town in the English midlands, by which time the firm that employed John James would have no further need for his presence in the Austrian capital.|$|R

40|$|Application of {{fertilizers}} such as urea, {{diammonium phosphate}} (DAP) and muriate of potash in soil adversely affected the spore germination <b>of</b> Arthrobotrys dactyloides. <b>Amendment</b> <b>of</b> soil with urea at {{the concentrations of}} 1. 0 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 1 % completely inhibited spore germination and direct trap formation on the conidium, whereas muriate of potash delayed and reduced the spore germination even at the lowest concentration. DAP also inhibited spore germination at 1. 0 % concentration, while at lower concentration the percentage of spore germination was reduced. Application of neem cake at the concentration of 0. 5 % also inhibited spore germination after 24 h <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> The inhibitory effect of neem cake was reduced after 15 days <b>of</b> <b>amendment,</b> while after 30 days after amendment the inhibitory effect was completely lost and the spore ger-minated by direct trap as in unamended soil.
