5|$|International District/Chinatown station {{consists}} of two side platforms situated under street level in an open-air structure and adjoining public plaza. It opened on September 15, 1990, as International District station, and was used exclusively by buses until a two-year renovation from 2005 to 2007 to accommodate light rail. Link light rail service to International District/Chinatown station began on July 18, 2009. Trains and buses serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between light rail trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. In 2023, the station will become the <b>merge</b> <b>point</b> between Central Link and the East Link Extension, which will continue east towards Bellevue and Redmond.|$|E

40|$|Airspace {{boundaries}} are designed around air traf-fic flows and their crossing and <b>merge</b> <b>points</b> to reduce controller workload and maximize capac-ity. Redesigning airspace boundaries {{today is a}} lengthy process, heavily dependent on past ex-perience and expert judgment. Therefore, the airspace boundaries remain fairly static and traf-fic flows tend to adhere to current airways. Traf-fic flows could be made more efficient by allow-ing them to change more dynamically adapting to congestion and weather. This would require airspace boundaries to be redesigned dynami-cally. This paper introduces a method for extract-ing the cross and <b>merge</b> <b>points</b> between dominant traffic flows from flight trajectories. These cross and <b>merge</b> <b>points</b> define a more flexible structure around which dynamic airspace boundaries may be designed. To evaluate the method, a set of cross and <b>merge</b> <b>points</b> are compared with current airway intersection points and airspace bound-aries. Results show that critical points from flight tracks are comparable to airway intersections. This comparison suggests cross and <b>merge</b> <b>points</b> based on forecast trajectories and constraints may be useful for designing dynamic airspace bound-aries for the future air transportation system. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Current {{arterial}} transfer functions {{have low}} capability in predicting aortic augmentation index (AIx) from radial pulse contour (RPC), {{because of the}} difficulty in accurately identifying the <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> (inflection point) in the derived aortic pulse contour (APC). We hypothesize that the formation time between each characteristic wave in APC is about one-third of ejection duration (ED/ 3). We sought to assess the accuracy of ED/ 3 in identifying the <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> in APC as compared to the conventional differential method. In addition, we sought to derive the AIx from RPC based on an arterial transfer function and the ED/ 3 method. Methods: APC and RPC sequences were measured digitally and simultaneously in 60 subjects (37 males; aged 60 ± 10 years). An ensemble-averaged RPC-to-APC transfer function was determined from 30 randomly selected subjects and was used to derive APC sequences in the 30 additional subjects. The accuracy of AIx predicted from RPC was determined. Results: In patients with a clearly identifiable <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> in APC, the ED/ 3 method identified the <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> of measured APC within 1. 97 ± 0. 60 ms of that identified by the conventional differential method, with identical AIx. The AIx and <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> of derived APC using the ED/ 3 method were also within 0. 22 ± 1. 01 % and 1. 81 ± 1. 64 ms, respectively, of those of the measured APC using the conventional differential method. The accuracy of the predicted AIx was independent of age, sex, body-mass index and presence of hypertension. Conclusion: In a quiet resting state, the ED/ 3 is an alternative method for identifying the <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> in APC. In conjunction with transfer-function technique, AIx can be derived accurately from RPC. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

For a given clock topology, we minimize the worst case skew without asking for the worst case temperature map. We decide the <b>merging</b> <b>point</b> level by level based on the sensitivity of the skew with respect to the change of <b>merging</b> <b>point.</b> Such sensitivity is calculated using a parameterized model, which is compressed by a singular-value-decomposition (SVD) and K-means based clustering considering the temperature correlation.
