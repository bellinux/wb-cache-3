Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{present study}} investigates the {{attitude}} of adolescents to authority. Thirty-eight adolescents from Boys' Town, Tongaat, participated in this study. The intention {{of the study was}} to investigate {{the attitude of}} the boys to authority and to determine whether there was a difference in attitude to authority according to grade, race, parental academic background or type of family structure that the boys had. Generally the adolescents at Boys' Town, Tongaat, viewed the <b>mother</b> as authoritarian <b>and</b> the <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible. Boys in grade 6 - 9 viewed both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible while boys in grade 10 - 12 viewed both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as permissive. The Indian and black adolescents viewed <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible while the white and coloured adolescents viewed <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as permissive. When parents had grade 12 or less qualification both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were viewed as permissive. When parents had a post-matric qualification, both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were viewed as authoritative/ flexible. Adolescents from single-family households found mother to be authoritative/flexible <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritarian. Adolescents from nuclear-family households found mother to be equally permissive <b>and</b> authoritative/flexible <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be permissive. Adolescents from extended-family households found mother to be permissive <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritative/flexible. Adolescents from foster families found both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritative/flexible. The positive changes that were brought about in the adolescents and in their relationship with their environment during their stay at Boys' Town, Tongaat, leads to the recommendation that the behaviour modification programme and the parenting skills workshop adopted by Boys' Town, be examined and assessed with the possible consideration for implementation at South African Schools and homes...|$|R

25|$|Family {{breakdown}} as {{a result}} of divorce, desertion, death, illness, domestic violence, drunkenness or the trauma of war led to children being taken into care or being placed in care by their own families. Few women who had been widowed, deserted or divorced could afford to raise children. Work opportunities were fewer for women than men, and women were paid less than the male wage for the same work. Lone <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> found it difficult to work to support children as there was little affordable childcare available.|$|E

25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers,</b> and ignored {{the fact that in the}} vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they are willing to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E
25|$|Saturday 8 September saw {{the biggest}} of the {{organised}} APEC protest rallies. Attendance was estimated at 3000 by police, 5000 by the media, and 10,000 by event organisers. While police expected crowds of 20,000, heavy rain dampened attendance. The rally was largely peaceful, consisting mainly of students, and <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> One incident of violence was reported, with 17 protesters arrested. Two police officers were injured, one officer struck in the forehead with a dart and the other officer struck with an iron bar.

25|$|The {{grandmother}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} menopause {{was selected for}} humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post-reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants {{in the first year}} of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. Arguably, however, there is no firm consensus on the supposed evolutionary advantages (or simply neutrality) of menopause to the survival of the species in the evolutionary past.|$|E

An ethnically diverse sample of 1, 714 university students from Florida International University (n= 1371) and Florida State University (n= 343) responded to measures on a questionnaire that included the Nurturant <b>Fathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mothering</b> Scales (Finley 2 ̆ 6 Schwartz, 2004; Schwartz 2 ̆ 6 Finley, 2005; Finley 2 ̆ 6 Schwartz, 2006), the <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Father</b> Involvement Scales (Finley, Mira, 2 ̆ 6 Schwartz, 2008), demographic measures, and academic outcome measures. In intact families, <b>mothering</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathering</b> variables were significantly correlated with each other, and positively correlated with child academic outcomes including grades, GPA, academic satisfaction, and academic importance. In divorced families, <b>mothering</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathering</b> variables were not correlated with each other. Furthermore, when analyzing divorced families, significant effects were found for both parent <b>and</b> child gender. <b>Mothering</b> variables were found to have the greatest positive impact for sons 2 ̆ 7 academic outcomes.

500|$|The liberal {{political}} party Yabloko {{stated that the}} re-adoption of the Soviet anthem [...] "deepened the schism in [...] society". The Soviet anthem {{was supported by the}} Communist Party and by Putin himself. The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols. After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia's history. He also stated that, while Russia's march towards democracy would not be stopped, the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives of their <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> bereft of meaning. It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem's lyrics; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
500|$|Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mark her as a rigid thinker. Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good. In this view, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly Puritanical attitudes towards raising children (exemplified in the doctrine of original sin). Although she attacked Rousseau's works, Grenby argues that she agreed with [...] "Rousseau's key idea, later {{taken up by the}} Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early", in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon. Trimmer also maintained that <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> should share the responsibility of caring for the family. Like the progressive educational reformers and children's authors Maria Edgeworth and Thomas Day and even Rousseau himself, Trimmer opposed rote learning and advocated flexible and conversational lessons that encouraged critical thinking in children. She also promoted breastfeeding (a controversial position at the time) and parental involvement in childhood education.|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
