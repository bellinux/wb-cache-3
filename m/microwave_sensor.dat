50|$|Microwave sensors. Similar to the {{ultrasonic}} sensor, a <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor</b> {{also works}} on the doppler shift principle. A <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor</b> will send high frequency microwaves in an area and will check for their reflected patterns. If the reflected pattern is changing continuously then it assumes that there is occupancy and the lighting load connected is turned on. If the reflected pattern {{is the same for}} a preset time then the sensor assumes there is no occupancy and the load is switched off. A <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor</b> has high sensitivity as well as detection range compared to other types of sensors.|$|E

50|$|Often, PIR {{technology}} is paired with another model to maximize accuracy and reduce energy use. PIR draws less energy than emissive microwave detection, {{and so many}} sensors are calibrated {{so that when the}} PIR sensor is tripped, it activates a <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor.</b> If the latter also picks up an intruder, then the alarm is sounded.|$|E
5000|$|The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) was {{a passive}} <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor</b> {{designed}} to provide quantitative rainfall information over a wide swath under the TRMM satellite. By carefully measuring the minute amounts of microwave energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere, TMI was able to quantify the water vapor, the cloud water, and the rainfall intensity in the atmosphere. It was a relatively small instrument that consumed little power. This, combined with the wide swath and the quantitative information regarding rainfall made TMI the [...] "workhorse" [...] of the rain-measuring package on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission.|$|E
50|$|Many modern motion {{detectors}} use {{combinations of}} different technologies. While combining multiple sensing technologies into one detector {{can help reduce}} false triggering, it does so {{at the expense of}} reduced detection probabilities and increased vulnerability. For example, many dual-tech sensors combine both a PIR sensor and a <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor</b> into one unit. For motion to be detected, both sensors must trip together. This lowers the probability of a false alarm since heat and light changes may trip the PIR but not the microwave, or moving tree branches may trigger the microwave but not the PIR. If an intruder is able to fool either the PIR or microwave, however, the sensor will not detect it.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{executed}} {{in a wide}} variety of techniques. Two basic signal processing techniques are applied, each offering its own advantages: Pulsed or Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) which is a measurement of time of flight divided by the speed of light, similar to ultrasonic level sensors, and Doppler systems employing FMCW techniques. Just as with ultrasonic level <b>sensors,</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>sensors</b> are executed at various frequencies, from 1 GHz to 60 GHz. [...] Generally, the higher the frequency, the more accurate, and the more costly. Microwave is executed non-contact technique or guided. The first is done by monitoring a microwave signal that is transmitted through free space (including vacuum) and reflected back, or can be executed as a “radar on a wire” technique, generally known as Guided Wave Radar or Guided Microwave Radar. In the latter technique, performance generally improves in powders and low dielectric media that are not good reflectors of electromagnetic energy transmitted through a void (as in non-contact <b>microwave</b> <b>sensors).</b> But with the guided technique the same mechanical constraints exist that cause problems for the capacitance (RF) techniques mentioned previously by having a probe in the vessel.|$|R
