5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E

25|$|Even in the {{earliest}} times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature {{as well as the}} prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach {{at the time of his}} appointment.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of prospective overruling was also {{applied in the}} case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997). The Court of Appeal clarified that the sentence of life imprisonment did not mean imprisonment for 20 years as had been the understanding for some time, but rather imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of a convicted person's natural life. However, if the judgment applied retrospectively, this would be unjust to accused persons already sentenced to life imprisonment as they would have been assured by lawyers and the Singapore Prison Service that they would only be incarcerated up to 20 years. Some accused persons <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> pleaded guilty on that understanding. Thus, the Court held that its re-interpretation of the law would not apply to convictions and offences committed prior to the date of the judgment.|$|E

25|$|Each ship could {{accommodate}} {{a maximum of}} sixty-four lifeboats. However, only 20 boats were installed on Olympic and Titanic during construction to avoid cluttering the deck and provide more space for passengers. Shipbuilders of the era envisaged the ocean liner itself as the ultimate lifeboat and therefore imagined that a lifeboat's purpose {{was that of a}} ferry between a foundering liner and a rescue ship. Despite the low number of lifeboats, both Olympic and Titanic exceeded Board of Trade regulations of the time. Following the sinking of Titanic, more lifeboats were added to Olympic (some lifeboats <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> been from the foundered Titanic). Britannic, meanwhile, was equipped with seven huge gantry davits, five along the Boat Deck and two on the Poop Deck at the stern. Each contained six lifeboats and were individually powered by electric motors with their own night time illumination. In the event that the ship should develop a list and make the lowering of lifeboats impossible along one side, the davits could be maneuvered to pick up lifeboats {{from the other side of}} the deck.|$|E

Cosa Nostra was behind the murder of De Mauro, but there were other backgrounds and individuals, allied with the Mafia, such as deviated freemasons and corrupt public officials. [...] "De Mauro was not killed out of revenge, but to prevent harm to the Mafia.

It never had the stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from the throne." [...] Even with radical propaganda and little interference from the authorities, the Republican Party in existence {{from the beginning of}} the 1870s was a small one. It praised republics such as the United States, France and Argentina, while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries. In 1889, its members were [...] "spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals. They were far from having the power to develop a propaganda that could shake the foundations of the throne." [...] In the [...] "political process of the second empire , the republican party had such a dull and secondary role that it <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> been forgotten; it was unable to influence rationales advocating the regime's dissolution."

500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish.

500|$|Nyuserre {{was then}} {{still a child}} and, in this hypothesis, his claim to the throne faced a serious {{challenge}} {{in the person of}} his possible uncle Shepseskare who might have been a son of Sahure. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have been a short-lived son of Neferefre or, less likely, an usurper from outside the royal family. In any case, Shepseskare apparently succeeded in holding the crown for a short time. Nyuserre ultimately prevailed however, either because of Shepseskare's own premature death or because he was backed by powerful high officials and members of the royal family, foremost among whom were his mother Khentkaus II and Ptahshepses. This latter hypothesis is motivated by the exalted positions that both individuals seem to have enjoyed. The mortuary temple of Khentkaus II was designed to imitate that of a king, for example by incorporating its own satellite pyramid and having an alignment on an east-west axis. [...] These features, together with Khentkaus II peculiar title of Mwt Nisw bity Nisw bity, originally translated by [...] "Mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt [...] the king of Upper and Lower Egypt" [...] led some scholars, including Verner, to propose that she <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> reigned in her own right. This hypothesis is now deemed unlikely, and her title is rather translated as [...] "Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt". [...] Ptahshepses became vizier under Nyuserre, whose daughter he married; received the honorary title of [...] "King's son"; and was buried in one of the largest private tombs in Egypt. According to Verner and Nigel Strudwick, the architectural elements of this tomb such as its lotus-bud columns similar to those used in Nyuserre's own temple, boat pits and layout of the burial chamber, demonstrate [...] "the favor shown by that king to his son-in-law".|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{testing of}} the M22 {{occurred}} in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted {{that the process of}} loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. [...] Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating {{that it would not be}} able to be successfully used during airborne operations. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a [...]50 caliber machine-gun. [...] Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.|$|E
