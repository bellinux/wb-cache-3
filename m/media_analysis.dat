500|$|According to Annika Brändström, in the {{aftermath}} of the 1989 and 1993 crashes, the Gripen risked a loss of credibility and the weakening of its public image. There was public speculation that failures to address technical problems exposed in the first crash had directly contributed to the second crash and thus had been avoidable. Brändström observed that media elements had called for greater public accountability and explanation of the project; ill-informed <b>media</b> <b>analysis</b> had also distorted public knowledge of the Gripen. The sitting Conservative government quickly endorsed and supported the Gripen– Minister of Defense Anders Björck issued a public reassurance that the project was very positive for Sweden. In connection to the Gripen's marketing efforts to multiple countries, including South Africa, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, there were reports of widespread bribery and corruption by BAE Systems and Saab. [...] In 2007, Swedish journalists reported that BAE had paid bribes equivalent to millions of dollars. [...] Following criminal investigations in eight countries, only one individual in Austria, Alfons Mensdorf-Pouilly, was prosecuted for bribery. The scandal tarnished the international reputation of the Gripen, BAE Systems, Saab, and Sweden.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} in devising solutions for on-line automatic content analysis, indexing and annotation of live networked multimedia sessions. These include content analysis under uncertainty (evidence of content are missed or hallucinated), the computational complexity of feature extraction and object recognition, {{and the massive}} amount of data to be analysed under real-time requirements. In this paper we propose an architectural framework for on-line <b>media</b> content <b>analysis</b> targeted as an approach to the above challenges. This includes an approach for formulating and transforming high-level media content queries into distributable configurations of <b>media</b> content <b>analysis</b> algorithms. Our framework allows the system to guide the user in trading off between the reliability and latency of the content analysis. The uniqueness of our architecture lies in the combination of probabilistic knowledge-based <b>media</b> content <b>analysis</b> with QoS and distributed resource management to handle real-time requirements. This is all packaged into a generic framework that is tailorable to specific application domains. ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Media</b> <b>analysis</b> of the {{incident}} hinged on {{the interpretation of the}} relevant rules. Rule 10.4.2 implies that the match does not automatically end when the siren sounds, but rather continues until the umpire hears the siren and signals the end of the game. This would lead {{to the conclusion that the}} result must stand as a draw. However, Rule 10.4.1 requires the timekeeper to sound the siren continuously until an umpire acknowledges the siren and calls an end to play. [...] This rule was not correctly observed by the timekeeper. This leads to an argument that the match was not brought to an end according to the rules of the game and that the outcome of the game was determined not within the playing arena but rather by external governance matters that are the responsibility of the AFL: the quality of match facilities and the performance of timekeeping duties. This line of argument leads to the view that natural justice required the game to be awarded to Fremantle.|$|E
