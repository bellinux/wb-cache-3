5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} <b>medical</b> <b>practice,</b> was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter <b>medical</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

5|$|Having {{finished}} her studies, Morton {{returned to the}} United States in 1902 and opened a <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> specialising in gynecology in Washington D.C. After marrying George Morton Jr., she opened a new <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> in New York, where he was an attorney. In 1909 the American Medical Association created a Public Health Education Committee {{with the aim of}} educating the public on subjects including health, hygiene, child care, and other medical topics; they made Morton its first chairperson. Morton was appointed as a clinical assistant and instructor at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York (where {{she was one of the}} first female faculty members), and later became a professor of gynecology.

5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> and with the historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Landis {{worked in}} Millville {{as a country}} physician. When Kenesaw was eight, the elder Landis moved his family to Delphi, Indiana and {{subsequently}} to Logansport, Indiana where the doctor purchased and ran several local farms—his war injury had caused him to scale back his <b>medical</b> <b>practice.</b> Two of Kenesaw's four brothers, Charles Beary Landis and Frederick Landis, became members of Congress.|$|E
40|$|Small <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> {{store and}} process the health {{information}} {{of their patients}} in order to aid in providing care to them. Because of this a level of trust exists between the patients and the practice to ensure the sensitive medical data is kept private and secure. There was no formalised way to test if this trust was well deserved and what level of protection was applied to such sensitive health records. A security model that is applicable to small <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> {{for the purpose of}} protecting and securing the personal health information they store was constructed and validated by a security expert from the security industry. This model was then applied to a number of small <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> to assess the level of data protection and computer security of medical information present in the surveyed practices. In general the practices were found to be complying with the security model, some discrepancies were discovered and noted. A formalised way to test if the trust patients place in their <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> is well deserved now exists. The trust that the patients of the small <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> surveyed placed in their practices was well deserved...|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} {{an internship}} {{and a trip}} abroad for postgraduate studies, DeLee was ready {{to set up a}} <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> by the age of 25. Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with the noted social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided prenatal care to the neighborhood's women, but the babies were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began having their babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E
5|$|At a {{time when}} <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> was in its infancy, and {{patients}} often fared better if left alone, the Christian Science message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, any {{distinction}} between the M.D. and the D.O. professions has eroded steadily; diminishing numbers of D.O. graduates enter primary care fields, fewer use OMT, and increasing numbers of osteopathic graduates choose to train in non-osteopathic residency programs.
