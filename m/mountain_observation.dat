40|$|The general aim of {{this work}} is to obtain the lateral {{distribution}} of atmospheric Cherenkov light in extensive air showers produced by different primary particles precisely by. protons, Helium, Iron, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Calcium, Silicon and gamma quanta in wide energy range at high <b>mountain</b> <b>observation</b> level of Chacaltaya cosmic ray station. The simulations are divided generally in two energy ranges 10 GeV- 10 TeV and 10 TeV- 10 PeV. One large detector {{has been used for}} simulations, the aim being to reduce the statistical fluctuations of the obtained characteristics. The shape of the obtained lateral distributions of Cherenkov light in extensive air showers is discussed and the scientific potential for solution of different problems as well.

40|$|We present multi-wavelength {{analysis}} for four bipolar bubbles (G 045. 386 - 0. 726, G 049. 998 - 0. 125, G 050. 489 + 0. 993, and G 051. 610 - 0. 357) {{to probe the}} structure and dynamics of their surrounding gas. The 12 CO J= 1 - 0, 13 CO J= 1 - 0 and C 18 O J= 1 - 0 observations are made with the Purple <b>Mountain</b> <b>Observation</b> (PMO) 13. 7 m radio telescope. For the four bipolar bubbles, the bright 8. 0 um emission shows the bipolar structure. Each bipolar bubble {{is associated with a}}n HII region. From CO observations we find that G 045. 386 - 0. 726 is composed of two bubbles with different distances, not a bipolar bubble. Each of G 049. 998 - 0. 125 and G 051. 610 - 0. 357 is associated with a filament. The filaments in CO emission divide G 049. 998 - 0. 125 and G 051. 610 - 0. 357 into two lobes. We suggest that the exciting stars of both G 049. 998 - 0. 125 and G 051. 610 - 0. 357 form in a sheet-like structure clouds. Furthermore, G 050. 489 + 0. 993 is associated with a clump, which shows a triangle-like shape with a steep integrated intensity gradient towards the two lobes of G 050. 489 + 0. 993. We suggest that the two lobes of G 050. 489 + 0. 993 have simultaneously expanded into the clump. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApS...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method for ground based gamma ray {{astronomy}} based only on atmospheric Cherenkov light flux analysis. The Cherenkov light flux densities in extensive air showers (EAS) initiated by different primaries are simulated, precisely primary protons in the energy range 100 GeV &# 8211; 100 PeV, primary gamma quanta in the energy range 10 GeV &# 8211; 10 PeV and primary iron nuclei in the energy range 10 TeV &# 8211; 100 PeV using the CORSIKA 6 code at high <b>mountain</b> <b>observation</b> level of 536 g/cm 2. An approximation of lateral distribution of Cherenkov light in extensive air showers is obtained. The obtained approximation is a nonlinear fit such as Breit-Wigner with few parameters. A detailed study of the energy dependence of the proposed model function parameters is carried out and the fit of model parameters {{as a function of}} the primary energy is obtained as well. On the basis of the difference between the model parameters, precisely their behavior {{as a function of the}} energy, the strong no linearity of the model, we propose a method, which permits to make the distinction between gamma ray primaries from hadronic primaries. The possible backgrounds for ground based gamma ray astronomy are studied and the efficiency of the method is calculated. Different detector displacements are analyzed using the simulation of simplified mass spectrum of cosmic ray. The detector response is simulated taking into account the physical fluctuation of the processes, the statistical and possible systematic errors. The simulated and reconstructed events are compared and the accuracy in energy and primary mass reconstruction is obtained. Moreover the accuracy in shower axis determination is studied and criteria in shower axis position estimation are proposed. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, presented at ECRS Firenze Sept. 200...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} a multi-wavelength study toward the filamentary cloud G 47. 06 + 0. 26 {{to investigate the}} gas kinematics and star formation. We present the 12 CO (J= 1 - 0), 13 CO (J= 1 - 0) and C 18 O (J= 1 - 0) observations of G 47. 06 + 0. 26 obtained with the Purple <b>Mountain</b> <b>Observation</b> (PMO) 13. 7 m radio telescope to investigate the detailed kinematics of the filament. The 12 CO (J= 1 - 0) and 13 CO (J= 1 - 0) emission of G 47. 06 + 0. 26 appear to show a filamentary structure. The filament extends about 45 arcmin (58. 1 pc) along the east-west direction. The mean width is about 6. 8 pc, as traced by the 13 CO (J= 1 - 0) emission. G 47. 06 + 0. 26 has a linear mass density of about 361. 5 Msun/pc. The external pressure (due to neighboring bubbles and H II regions) may help preventing the filament from dispersing under the effects of turbulence. From the velocity-field map, we discern a velocity gradient perpendicular to G 47. 06 + 0. 26. From the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) catalog, we found nine BGPS sources in G 47. 06 + 0. 26, that appear to these sources have sufficient mass to form massive stars. We obtained that the clump formation efficiency (CFE) is about 18 % in the filament. Four infrared bubbles {{were found to be}} located in, and adjacent to, G 47. 06 + 0. 26. Particularly, infrared bubble N 98 shows a cometary structure. CO molecular gas adjacent to N 98 also shows a very intense emission. H II regions associated with infrared bubbles can inject the energy to surrounding gas. We calculated the kinetic energy, ionization energy, and thermal energy of two H II regions in G 47. 06 + 0. 26. From the GLIMPSE I catalog, we selected some Class I sources with an age of about 100000 yr, which are clustered along the filament. The feedback from the H II regions may cause the formation {{of a new generation of}} stars in filament G 47. 06 + 0. 26. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} radio continuum, infrared, and CO {{molecular}} observations of infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G 38. 95 - 0. 47 and its adjacent H II regions G 38. 91 - 0. 44 (N 74), G 38. 93 - 0. 39 (N 75), and G 39. 30 - 1. 04. The Purple <b>Mountain</b> <b>Observation</b> (PMO) 13. 7 m radio telescope {{was used to}} detect 12 CO J= 1 - 0, 13 CO J= 1 - 0 and C 18 O J= 1 - 0 lines. The carbon monoxide (CO) molecular observations can ensure the real association between the ionized gas and the neutral material observed nearby. To select young stellar objects (YSOs) associated this region, we used the GLIMPSE I catalog. The 13 CO J= 1 - 0 emission presents two large cloud clumps. The clump consistent with IRDC G 38. 95 - 0. 47 shows a triangle- like shape, and has a steep integrated-intensity gradient toward H II regions G 38. 91 - 0. 44 and G 39. 30 - 1. 04, suggesting that the two H II regions have expanded into the IRDC. Four submillmeter continuum sources have been detected in the IRDC G 38. 95 - 0. 47. Only the G 038. 95 - 00. 47 -M 1 source with a mass of 117 Msun has outflow and infall motions, indicating a newly forming massive star. We detected a new collimated outflow in the clump compressed by G 38. 93 - 0. 39. The derived ages of the three H II regions are 6. 1 * 10 ^ 5 yr, 2. 5 * 10 ^ 5 yr, and 9. 0 * 10 ^ 5 yr, respectively. In the IRDC G 38. 95 - 0. 47, the significant enhancement of several Class I YSOs indicates the presence of some recently formed stars. Comparing the ages of these H II regions with YSOs (Class I sources and massive G 038. 95 - 00. 47 -M 1 source), we suggest that YSOs may be triggered by G 38. 91 - 0. 44 and G 39. 30 - 1. 04 together, which supports the radiatively driven implosion model. It {{may be the first}} time that the triggered star formation has occurred in the IRDC compressed by two H II regions. The new detected outflow may be driven by a star cluster.

40|$|Using {{the data}} from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) and Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), we {{performed}} a study for a large-scale infrared bubble with a size of about 16 pc at a distance of 2. 0 kpc. We present the 12 CO J= 1 - 0, 13 CO J= 1 - 0 and C 18 O J= 1 - 0 observations of HII region G 53. 54 - 0. 01 (Sh 2 - 82) obtained at the the Purple <b>Mountain</b> <b>Observation</b> (PMO) 13. 7 m radio telescope to investigate the detailed distribution of associated molecular material. The large-scale infrared bubble shows a half-shell morphology at 8 um. H II regions G 53. 54 - 0. 01, G 53. 64 + 0. 24, and G 54. 09 - 0. 06 are situated on the bubble. Comparing the radio recombination line velocities and associated 13 CO J= 1 - 0 components of the three H II regions, we found that the 8 um emission associated with H II region G 53. 54 - 0. 01 should belong to the foreground emission, and only overlap with the large-scale infrared bubble in the line of sight. Three extended green objects (EGOs, the candidate massive young stellar objects), as well as three H II regions and two small-scale bubbles are found located in the G 54. 09 - 0. 06 complex, indicating an active massive star-forming region. C 18 O J= 1 - 0 emission presents four cloud clumps on the northeastern border of H II region G 53. 54 - 0. 01. Via comparing the spectral profiles of 12 CO J= 1 - 0, 13 CO J= 1 - 0, and C 18 O J= 1 - 0 peak at each clump, we found the collected gas in the three clumps, except for the clump coincided with a massive YSO (IRAS 19282 + 1814). Using the evolutive model of H II region, we derived that the age of H II region G 53. 54 - 0. 01 is 1. 5 * 10 ^ 6 yr. The significant enhancement of several Class I and Class II YSOs around G 53. 54 - 0. 01 indicates the presence of some recently formed stars, which may be triggered by this H II region through the collect and collapse (CC) process.
