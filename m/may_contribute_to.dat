5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> biofilm formation; and it <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E

5|$|The 2s {{electrons}} of beryllium <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, {{it does so}} {{by taking}} electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding.

However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E

Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E

Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E

A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas.

These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> clogged milk ducts in {{lactating}} women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, {{they do not}} easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars).

This instability occurs mostly at high speed and {{is similar to that}} experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
