Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{proteinuria}} {{is recognized}} as a risk predictor for all-cause <b>and</b> cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> in diabetic patients; however, no study has evaluated these relationships in Brazilian patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prognostic value of gross proteinuria for all-cause <b>and</b> cardiovascular <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> for cardiovascular morbidity in a cohort study of 471 type 2 diabetic individuals followed for up to 7 years. Several clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic variables were obtained at baseline. The relative risks for all-cause, cardiovascular <b>and</b> cardiac <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> for cardiovascular and cardiac events associated with the presence of overt proteinuria (> 0. 5 g/ 24 h) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and by multivariate Cox regression model. During a median follow-up of 57 months (range 2 - 84 months), 121 patients (25. 7 %) died, 44 from cardiovascular and 30 from cardiac causes, and 106 fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events occurred. Gross proteinuria was an independent risk predictor of all-cause, cardiovascular <b>and</b> cardiac <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> of cardiovascular morbidity with adjusted relative risks ranging from 1. 96 to 4. 38 for the different endpoints. This increased risk remained significant after exclusion of patients with prior cardiovascular disease at baseline from the multivariate analysis. In conclusion, gross proteinuria was a strong predictor of all-cause, cardiovascular <b>and</b> cardiac <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> also of cardiovascular morbidity in a Brazilian cohort of type 2 diabetic patients. Intervention studies are necessary to determine whether the reduction of proteinuria can decrease morbidity <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> of type 2 diabetes in Brazil...|$|R

5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause <b>mortality,</b> <b>and</b> it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E

5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries.

The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant <b>mortality</b> <b>and</b> hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E

5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant <b>mortality,</b> <b>and</b> growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption.

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of <b>mortality,</b> <b>and</b> may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E

He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, <b>mortality,</b> <b>and</b> that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.|$|E

5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early dispersal of young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male <b>mortality</b> <b>and</b> imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of roads in any landscape {{is known to}} negatively influence terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many tourist destinations and religious enclaves in developing countries are inside protected areas (PA). They are well connected by roads and attract thousands of visitors. The effect of such large human congregations inside PA on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, we address the impacts of increased vehicular traffic due to religious tourism on local fauna inside the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in south India. We sampled sections of surfaced roads for <b>mortalities</b> before <b>and</b> during an annual festival across three habitats in 2008 and 2009. Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50 % of these <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> 64 % of the species composition. There was a 299 % increase in road <b>mortalities</b> <b>and</b> 648 % increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three {{times higher than the}} threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas...|$|R
