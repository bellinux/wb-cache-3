5|$|Order Paleonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. Their body wall has outer {{circular}} {{and inner}} length-wise <b>muscles.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Carinoma tremaphoros has circular and inner length-wise <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis; the extra muscle layers {{seem to be}} needed for burrowing by peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> their walls. The oral disc has radial <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis, {{but most of the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} are {{skeletal muscle}} sensory organs {{involved in the}} sensation of position and movement of the body. We have explored the capability of phase contrast computed tomography to visualise <b>muscle</b> spindles <b>in</b> murine skeletal <b>muscle.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we have validated the visualisation of nerve fibres through phase contrast computed tomography using light microscopy on stained histological sections. We further present the first 3 D visualisation of <b>muscle</b> spindles <b>in</b> mouse soleus skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the neurovascular bundle associated with it...|$|R

40|$|Two {{previously}} unknown anomalies of the anterior intercostobrachial nerve were described. In one case, the anterior intercostobrachial nerve penetrated the pectoralis minor <b>muscle.</b> <b>In</b> the other case, it penetrated the pectoralis major <b>muscle.</b> <b>In</b> both cases, the anomalous nerve supplied {{the skin of}} the upper arm. </p...|$|R
5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms of <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> {{either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle {{with only a}} slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
50|$|The muscle {{cells of}} the iris are smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> mammals and amphibians, but are {{striated}} <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> reptiles (including birds). Many fish have neither, and, as a result, their irides are unable to dilate and contract, so that the pupil always remains of a fixed size.|$|R

50|$|Nathan {{fell out}} of a grocery cart when he was five, tearing a <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> his eye, thus {{resulting}} in having to wear an eye patch and glasses {{for much of his}} childhood. He sometimes loses control of the <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> his eye, but does not have a lazy eye.|$|R
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall <b>muscles.</b> <b>In</b> most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> a split second directly from the brain.|$|E

5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|In January 1886 David {{spent a week}} in Auckland {{hospital}} undergoing {{surgery to}} treat stunted <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine. His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took {{a job with a}} local stock and station agent.|$|E

5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's <b>muscles.</b> <b>In</b> some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E

5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, {{it is entirely}} striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|R
