40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of biological and chemical fertilisers on morphological traits, yield and yield components of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a field experiment was conducted in Maragheh (37 ° 23 ' N; 46 ° 16 ' E), in north western Iran, for one year in the 2014 growing season. The effect of seven treatments was evaluated: T 1 - control (no fertiliser application), T 2 - seed inoculation with P biofertiliser (contains phosphate solubilising bacteria; Pantoea agglomerans strain P 5 and Pseudomonas putida strain P 13), T 3 - seed inoculation with N biofertiliser (contains Azotobacter vinelandii strain O 4), T 4 - foliar application of iron chelate, T 5 - soil application of complete NPK, T 6 : foliar application of <b>manganese</b> <b>chelate,</b> and T 7 - foliar application of zinc sulphate.

40|$|Oxaliplatin, in {{combination}} with 5 -fluorouracil plus folinate (or capecitabine), has increased survival substantially in stage III colorectal cancer and prolonged life in stage IV patients, but its use is compromised because of severe toxicity. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most problematic dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin. Oncologists included for years calcium and magnesium infusion as part of clinical practice for preventing CIPN. Results from a phase III prospective study published in 2014, however, overturned this practice. No other treatments have been clinically proven to prevent this toxicity. There is a body of evidence that CIPN is caused by cellular oxidative stress. Clinical and preclinical {{data suggest that the}} <b>manganese</b> <b>chelate</b> and superoxide dismutase mimetic mangafodipir (MnDPDP) is an efficacious inhibitor of CIPN and other conditions caused by cellular oxidative stress, without interfering negatively with the tumoricidal activity of chemotherapy. MnPLED, the metabolite of MnDPDP, attacks cellular oxidative stress at several critical levels. Firstly, MnPLED catalyzes dismutation of superoxide (O 2 •−), and secondly, having a tremendous high affinity for iron (and copper), PLED binds and disarms redox active iron/copper, which is involved in several detrimental oxidative steps. A case report from 2009 and a recent feasibility study suggest that MnDPDP may prevent or even cure oxaliplatin-induced CIPN. Preliminary results from a phase II study (PLIANT) suggest efficacy also of calmangafodipir, but these results are according to available data obscured by a surprisingly low number of adverse events and a seemingly lower than expected efficacy of FOLFOX...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} some of the areas where electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has provided unique information to MRI developments. The field of application mainly encompasses the EPR characterization of MRI paramagnetic contrast agents (gadolinium and <b>manganese</b> <b>chelates,</b> nitroxides) and superparamagnetic agents (iron oxide particles). The combined use of MRI and EPR has also been used to qualify or disqualify sources of contrast in MRI. Illustrative examples are presented with attempts to qualify oxygen sensitive contrast (i. e. T 1 - and T 2 *-based methods), redox status or melanin content in tissues. Other areas are likely to benefit from the combined EPR/MRI approach, namely cell tracking studies. Finally, the combination of EPR and MRI studies on the same models provides invaluable data regarding tissue oxygenation, hemodynamics and energetics.

After different degrees of washing of the pulps, bleaching experiments at different total alkali charges were performed with and without sodium silicate additions, and the ISO brightness of hand-made sheets was measured. The residual hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching liquor was also determined. No significant difference in either the brightness development or the residual hydrogen peroxide content could be detected between the pulps treated with equivalent molar ratios of the different complexing agents. Furthermore, the recovery of the chelating surfactant-manganese complexes from laboratory made white water by froth flotation was also studied. Two different foaming agents; sodium dodecyl sulphonate (SDS) and dimethyldodecylamine oxide (DDAO), were tested in the froth generation.

The well-established anti-Candida potential of metal complexes containing 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) ligands encouraged us to evaluate different copper(II), manganese(II), and silver(I) phen chelates for their ability to inhibit planktonic growth and biofilm of C. haemulonii species complex. Two novel coordination complexes, {[Cu(3, 6, 9 -tdda) (phen) 2]. 3 H 2 O. EtOH}n and [Ag 2 (3, 6, 9 -tdda) (phen) 4]. EtOH (3, 6, 9 -tddaH 2 = 3, 6, 9 -trioxaundecanedioic acid), were synthesized in a similar fashion to the other, previously documented, sixteen copper(II), manganese(II), and silver(I) chelates employed herein. Three isolates of each C. haemulonii species complex were used and the effect of the metal chelates on viability was determined utilizing the CLSI standard protocol and on biofilm-growing cells using the XTT assay. Cytotoxicity of the chelates was evaluated by the MTT assay, employing lung epithelial cells. The majority of the metal chelates were capable of interfering with the viability of planktonic-growing cells of all the fungal isolates. The silver complexes were the most effective drugs (overall geometric mean of the minimum inhibitory concentration (GM-MIC) ranged from 0. 26 to 2. 16 μM), followed by the manganese (overall GM-MIC ranged from 0. 87 to 10. 71 μM) and copper (overall GM-MIC ranged from 3. 37 to > 72 μM) <b>chelates.</b> The <b>manganese</b> <b>chelates</b> (CC 50 values ranged from 234. 51 to > 512 μM) were the least toxic to the mammalian cells, followed by the silver (CC 50 values ranged from 2. 07 to 13. 63 μM) and copper (CC 50 values ranged from 0. 53 to 3. 86 μM) compounds. When tested against mature biofilms, the chelates were less active, with MICs ranging from 2 - to 33 -fold higher levels when compared to the planktonic MIC counterparts. Importantly, manganese(II), copper(II), and silver(I) phen chelates are relatively cheap and easy to synthesize and they offer significant antifungal chemotherapeutic potential for the treatment of highly resistant pathogens...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the synthesis and characterisation of a series of novel ruthenium (II) polypyridyl complexes, which are potentially models for artificial photosynthesis. Chapter 1, the introduction, highlights the literature relevant to the topic. In Chapter 2, the experimental conditions of the various methods of characterisation are described. The synthesis and characterisation of a range of novel 5 -phenyI- 3 -(2 - pyridyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazoles, their Ru(bpy) 2 and their Ru(dg-bpy) 2 complexes are discussed in Chapter 3. Each of the new ligands bear terminal functional groups which allow larger supramolecular systems to be constructed. Complexes were characterised by spectroscopic (NMR, UV/Vis, Luminescence) and electrochemical techniques. Their properties were found to be pH dependent. In every case, the emissive excited state of the ruthenium complexes was determined to be located on the bpy ligands. Chapter 4 is concerned with the synthesis and characterisation of the Ru(bpy) 2 and Ru(dg-bpy) 2 complexes of novel 5 -phenyl- 3 -(2 -pyrazyl) -l, 2, 4 -triazoles, analogous to those described in Chapter 3. The presence of the strongly ^-accepting pyrazine alters the electronic properties, with respect to the pyridyl triazole complexes. Again, spectroscopic and electrochemical studies display a strong pH dependency. The location of the excited state was pH dependent, with it being bpy-based above pH 4, while below this pH, results were inconclusive. In Chapter 5, the complexes prepared in Chapters 3 and 4 are used to prepare more complex systems. In collaboration with Prof. Akkermark in Sweden, two tyrosine containing complexes were prepared, as models of the tyrosine Yz, which is located between Peso and the manganese cluster in Photosystem II. A range of ruthenium complexes containing potential <b>manganese</b> <b>chelating</b> ligands were also prepared. Due to chromatographic problems, {{it was not possible to}} isolate them in a pure form. In collaboration with Prof. Girerd in Paris, a Ru-Tyr-Mn 2 system was prepared and characterised. The manganese atoms were found to be antiferromagnetically coupled, giving rise to similar EPR and magnetic susceptibility measurements to a known model manganese complex. The work presented in Chapter 6 was carried out in collaboration with Prof. Fuhrhop in Berlin, where a novel bola amphiphile was prepared. It is hoped that this may be used to prepare a rigid membrane containing Angstrom gaps, which may be closed by complexation with ruthenium. The ruthenium complexes of the interemediates were also prepared and characterised by spectroscopic and electrochemcial techniques. Finally, Chapter 7 gives an overview of the work that is presented in this thesis and suggests further experiments, which may be carried out in future studies...|$|R

For thispurpose, phosphazene, adamantane, triazine and benzene scaffolds were evaluated. Withphosphazene, adamantane and triazine, the synthesis of multimeric ligands was unsuccessful. When trisacetylenebenzene derivatives were used as central units, 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition withthe azido-functionalized prochelator allowed obtaining a valeric acid functionalized and anunfunctionalised tristriazole-CDTA ligand (TTB-(CDTA) 3). Radiolabelling of these ligands with the positron emitting nuclide manganese- 52 g was first testedusing commercially available CDTA, which could be successfully labelled within 30 min at roomtemperature. Using the non-active reference compound, a Reversed-Phase High PerformanceLiquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was established for purification and identification ofthe radioactive compound [52 gMn][Mn(CDTA) ] 2 -. The purified complex was incubated in humanblood serum to quantify the dissociation behaviour of the radiocomplex under in vivo conditions. Size-Exclusion-HPLC allowed the determination of tDiss 1 / 2 = 12 h at 37 °C.

The material consists of an organophosphosilane hydrogel with strongly <b>chelated</b> <b>manganese</b> (II) ions and a covalently attached PEG surface layer. In vivo MRI of the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model was performed on a 3 T clinical scanner. Tissues were thereafter analyzed for manganese and silicon content using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The presence of nanomaterial in tumor and muscle tissue was assessed using an anti-PEG monoclonal antibody. MR imaging of tumor-bearing mice (n =  7) showed a contrast enhancement factor of 1. 8 (tumor versus muscle) at 30 minutes post-administration. Contrast was retained and further increased 2 - 4 hours after administration. ICP-AES and immunohistochemistry confirmed selective accumulation of nanomaterial in tumor tissue. A blood pharmacokinetics analysis showed that the concentration of Spago Pix gradually decreased over the first hour, which was in good agreement with the time frame in which the accumulation in tumor occurred. In summary, we demonstrate that Spago Pix selectively enhances MR tumor contrast in a clinically relevant animal model.

The structures of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Compound 1 {{has been shown to}} be isostructural with its rhenium analogue, although twinning or disorder problems precluded accurate analysis. The nitrido compounds 2 and 3 have a common tetrahedral co-ordination sphere of manganese bonded to one nitride and three imido groups. The lithium cations are bonded to one nitride and three imido groups. The lithium cations are bonded to the imido nitrogen atoms, chloride ions and ether oxygen atoms. Compound 4 has a molecular structure which comprises a four-co-ordinate tetrahedral ‘spiro’ <b>manganese</b> atom <b>chelated</b> by two N(But) C(H) C 6 H 3 (Me) NH– ligands. The six-membered chelate ring formed is approximately planar and the spiro rings (one generated from the other by the two-fold axis through Mn) are almost perpendicular, with a dihedral angle of 91. 5 ° at the MnII centre. The two formally single Mn–N bonds are slightly different at 2. 036 and 2. 135 Å. The alkyl dimers 7 and 10 have closely analogous symmetrical structures, comprising two tetrahedral manganese atoms bridged by two imido groups and each bonded to one terminal imido and one alkyl ligand. With respect to the central Mn 2 N 2 unit the two alkyls and the two imides adopt cis or Z arrangements. The geometry of the planar Mn 2 N 2 unit in each structure has acute Mn–N–Mn (average 83. 6 °) and obtuse N–Mn–N (average 96. 3 °) angles consistent with the presence of direct Mn–Mn interaction, which formally has double bond character. Compound 11 has a molecular structure which contains a two-fold axis passing through the methyl and the Zn and Mn atoms. There is an unusual trigonal-planar ZnII atom bonded to a methyl group and two bridging imido groups; Mn(1), in oxidation state V, is bonded to four bridging imido ligands, and Mn(2), oxidation state VI, is bonded to two bridging and two terminal imido ligands...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 80 medium-lean growth {{crossbred}} barrows (initially 77 lb) {{was used in}} a study to evaluate the effect of manganese level (24, 44, or 88 ppm) and source (inorganic vs <b>chelated</b> <b>manganese)</b> on growth performance and carcass characteristics of finishing pigs. Barrows were allotted by weight to pens containing two pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were {{assigned to one of}} four dietary treatments with 10 replications per treatment. Pigs were housed in pens (5 ft x 5 ft) in an environmentally regulated finishing barn and allowed ad libitum access to feed and water. Pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet formulated to contain. 8 % lysine and providing 24 ppm of inorganic Mn supplied from manganese oxide (control). Additional treatments included the control diet plus 20 ppm of a chelated form of Mn (a total of 44 ppm dietary Mn); control diet plus 20 ppm of inorganic Mn (manganese oxide; a total of 44 ppm dietary Mn); and the control diet plus 64 ppm of inorganic Mn (manganese oxide; a total of 88 ppm dietary Mn). Pigs were fed their respective experimental diet for the entire study. Pigs and feeders were weighed every 2 weeks to measure Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion (F/G) until the mean weight of pigs in a pen averaged 225 lb. At this time, both pigs in the pens were slaughtered, and standard carcass measurements were recorded. For the overall trial, no differences occurred in growth performance among pigs fed any of the experimental treatments. Pigs had mean ADG, ADFI, and F/G of 2. 10 lb, 6. 881 b, and 3. 24, respectively. No differences occurred in carcass traits, with all pigs having approximately 1. 20 inches of backfat and between 4. 50 and 5. 0 square inches of longissimus muscle area. In conclusion, additional manganese above 24 ppm from an inorganic or chelated source had no effect on growth performance or carcass characteristics of medium-lean growth finishing pigs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the central {{carbohydrate}} metabolism and exopolysaccharide (EPS) formation in two different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) : Lactobacillus reuteri and Pediococcus parvulus. LAB are traditionally used as starter cultures in the food industry. In general, LAB harbours one glycolytic pathway converting carbohydrates into lactic acid. However, L. reuteri ATCC 55730 was proven to use two functional glycolytic pathways by metabolic flux analysis and enzyme measurements. Surprisingly, the main flux was directed through the phosphoketolase pathway, while the Embden-Meyerhof pathway was used merely as a shunt. A combination of the NAD(P) H/NAD(P) ratio and an extra energy gain is speculated to be the controlling mechanism. Furthermore, only a minor fraction of the utilised carbohydrates is directed into EPS formation. Therefore, the volumetric production of EPS is too low to make it feasible as a natural biothickener in the food industry. In this work enhanced production of EPSs was achieved in both Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 and Pediococcus parvulus 2. 6 by optimisation of the bacterial cultivation conditions. The combination of high biomass yield and surplus of sugar had {{a positive effect on}} both bacteria, and resulted in continued production after entering the stationary phase. Reuteransucrase, the enzyme responsible for EPS formation in L. reuteri ATCC 55730, was proven to be constitutively expressed and the enzymatic activity profile was independent of the sugar source in the medium. Temperature and pH were found {{to be the most important}} factors for EPS formation. The best EPS production was obtained at 37 ?C, pH 4. 5 and 100 g sucrose l- 1. A growth model developed in this work indicates that maximal growth yield is maintained under these conditions while sucrose is taken up by facilitated diffusion. At higher sucrose concentrations lower EPS formation might be due to a relatively lower specific biomass yield and a lower expression of the sucrase gene. In P. parvulus 2. 6 EPS production was increased by the combination of high manganese, glucose and ethanol levels. Lactate, the main fermentation product, <b>chelates</b> <b>manganese</b> therby inhibiting growth. This inhibition could be overcome by increasing the manganese concentration in the growth medium...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{effects of}} soil moisture, mineral {{nutrition}} and temperature on the susceptibility of peas to inoculation with bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) by the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulz.) were investigated {{along with three}} vector-virus relationships. In addition, a comparative study was made of two methods of evaluating susceptibility of slants to inoculation with virus by aphids. A more accurate method of estimating plant susceptibility to inoculation with virus by aphids is proposed. With this method, the aphid is allowed to probe only once on a test plant rather than spending; its entire infective feeding period on the plant. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the susceptibility of plants grown in very moist soil and the susceptibility of plants grown in very dry soil even though the plants in the dry soil were strikingly dwarfed. Additions of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to the soil at the time of planting had no effect on the susceptibility of Lincoln and Perfected Wales peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids even though these treatments resulted in large increases in the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil and plants. The addition of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, <b>manganese</b> and zinc <b>chelates</b> to the soil had no effect on the susceptibility of Lincoln peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids. There was an increase in susceptibility of Lincoln peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids with decrease in preinoculation temperature over a range of 15 ° to 36 ° C. Regression analysis indicated the increase was linear and amounted to approximately a six percent increase in susceptibility for each degree centigrade decrease in temperature. Plants grown at postinoculation temperatures below 24 ° were less susceptible than plants grown at 246. Plant susceptibility was greater at a postinoculation temperature of 30 ° than at 24 °. Initial work indicated the effects of preinoculation and postinoculation temperatures were not additive. No significant differences in virus transmission were found for aphids with acquisition probes in the 11 - to 45 -second range. Increase in test probe time resulted in increase in virus transmission over a 6 - to 60 -second range, the major increase occurring after 35 seconds. In an experiment on the retention of BYMV by feeding aphids, the transmission decreased from an initial level of 74...|$|R
