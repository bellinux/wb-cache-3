50|$|Toggle {{switches}} {{are available}} in many different styles and sizes, and are used in numerous applications.

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the <b>mains</b> <b>voltage.</b> Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|In some {{consumer}} electronic equipment, {{notably in}} television sets {{in the era}} of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full <b>mains</b> <b>voltage,</b> it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{vacuum tubes}} {{are much less}} {{susceptible}} than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> surges or lightning, the electromagnetic pulse effect of nuclear explosions or geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares. This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the MiG-25. In that plane, output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can burn through a channel under interference.|$|E

25|$|Regulators powered from AC power {{circuits}} can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as {{the series}} device. Whenever the output voltage {{is below the}} desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but {{because they can not}} terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger, both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors, {{including}} film types, {{designed for}} continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60nbsp&Hz) <b>mains</b> <b>voltage,</b> typically between line and neutral or line and ground for interference suppression, {{are required to}} meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240nbsp&VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit). A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application {{is due to the}} corona effect: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of permanent connection). Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a voltage of 100-120VAC, insufficient to cause ionisation. Manufacturers also adopt cheaper and smaller construction intended to avoid corona effect without series-connected sections, for example minimising enclosed air.|$|E

Outside of distribution panels standard category 5 UTP cable can be used.|$|R
5000|$|An AC adapter is a {{power supply}} built into an AC mains power plug. AC {{adapters}} are also known by various other names such as [...] "plug pack" [...] or [...] "plug-in adapter", or by slang terms such as [...] "wall wart".

2500|$|In Europe, {{where the}} <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> is between 220 and 240 V, {{it is common}} to use series pairs of 110 V lamps because the thicker {{filament}} is much less liable to vibration-induced fracture; an important consideration for touring rigs and music venues.|$|E
2500|$|The EU set {{a target}} of 2016 to phase out halogen bulbs with two {{directives}} [...] EC 244/2009 and EC 1194/2012. The phase {{out of the first}} directive EC 244/2009 originally planned for September 2016 was delayed until September 2018. The second directive EC 1194/2012 was upheld, as part of a review of the lighting directive four criteria needed to be assessed before a phase-out could be confirmed. Issues of ‘affordability’ were under scrutiny, as well as performance, equivalence to existing models and compatibility. The EU confirmed that there was absolutely no reason to delay the ban on <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> directional halogen lamps, as all four of the criteria had been sufficiently met. [...] The directive EC 1194/2012 relates to <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> directional halogen lamps and means many common halogen reflector lamps such as D rated GU10's are affected.|$|E
25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges <b>mains</b> <b>voltages</b> across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially tripping electrical breakers or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.|$|R

The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with <b>mains</b> <b>voltages.</b> Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage, high current converter that single die LEDs need. Usually, they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace (e.g. a bulb) and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we focus our {{attention}} on the channel variation of indoor powerline channels caused {{by the presence of}} nonlinear loads. The nonlinear behavior of some electrical devices (with respect to the <b>mains</b> <b>voltages)</b> produces short time variations synchronous to the mains. The goal of our investigation is to obtain estimates of the upper and lower bounds of the channel’s response both in the time and in the frequency domain in such situation. Nonlinearities are modeled in the frequency domain as the sum of a nominal value impedance and a number of elementary pulse shaped terms with uncertain weights. The indoor power line channel is modeled in the wavelet domain and a sensitivity analysis with respect to the weights is performed by the adjoint circuit method. The proposed method allows a fast and accurate evaluation of the bounds of the response of the channel avoiding time consuming Montecarlo simulations...|$|R

For the control design, an equivalent dc-dc small-signal model of the converter is derived and verified by simulations and measurements.

Alternating current capacitors are specifically designed to work on line (<b>mains)</b> <b>voltage</b> AC power circuits. They are commonly used in electric motor circuits and are often designed to handle large currents, so they tend to be physically large.
