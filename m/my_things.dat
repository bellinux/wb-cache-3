500|$|The {{period from}} 1866 to 1884 is {{characterized}} by his major illustrated stories, such as Helen Who Couldn't Help It. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in Painter Squirtle (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a pedant. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous. The early stories follow the pattern of children's books of orthodox education, such as those by Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour. Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: [...] "I look at <b>my</b> <b>things</b> for what they are, as Nuremberg trinkets , as Schnurr Pfeiferen [...] whose value {{is to be found}} not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)".|$|E
