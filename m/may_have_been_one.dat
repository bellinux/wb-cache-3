The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng.

5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the robbery <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 {{had attempted to}} fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of {{the factors}} that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the {{first of a series of}} internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much more {{is known about the}} pigeon cameras developed {{at about the same time}} by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith died {{soon after}} Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been {{considered}} one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid {{to stay out of}} Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted only a few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.|$|E

5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western {{corner of the building}} collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E

5|$|On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR {{was taking}} part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, {{targeting}} the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain – it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among {{the main body of the}} fleet.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, {{composed}} of Christians who had long followed a separate Orthodox rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been in schism since 1054. Historians {{have argued that the}} desire to impose Roman church authority in the east <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the goals of the crusade, although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position {{on the eve of the}} Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster. By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east. In response to the defeat at Manzikert and subsequent Byzantine losses in Anatolia in 1074, Pope Gregory VII had called for the milites Christi ("soldiers of Christ") to go to Byzantium's aid. This call was largely ignored and even opposed. The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert was shocking, it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at least in the short term.|$|E
