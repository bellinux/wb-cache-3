The KB values of metoprolol, a beta-i antag-onist, in the coronary arteries from different mammals did not differ, but were appreciably smaller {{than those in}} the dog renal and mesenteric arteries. Treatment with butoxamine, a beta- 2 antagonist, inhibited the relaxation of dog mesenteric arteries {{to a greater extent than}} that of <b>monkey</b> <b>and</b> dog coronary arteries. Terbutaline, a beta- 2 agonist, produced a greater relaxation in <b>monkey</b> mesenteric <b>and</b> dog renal and mesenteric arteries than in human, <b>monkey</b> <b>and</b> dog coronary arteries.

5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, {{they have had to}} compete with <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes, as well as other mammals.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{is home to}} a {{world-class}} primate behavioural research centre, Living Links. Living Links consists of a field station and research centre that was developed in a partnership with the University of St Andrews. The centre houses capuchin <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> squirrel monkeys originating from the forests of South America, and offers researchers unique opportunities to study primate behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Possible {{homologous}} {{structures in}} other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis muscle, the pectoralis quartus muscle or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing muscle in <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes where it has its origin in the tendinous region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E

The discovery of Saadanius may help answer questions about the evolution and appearance of the last common ancestors of Old World <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes.|$|E
5|$|With smaller prey, such as <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> hares, {{the tiger}} bites the nape, often {{breaking}} the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery. Though rarely observed, some tigers {{have been recorded}} to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E

5|$|Between 1972 and 1975, {{what is now}} the B {{store in}} Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975.

5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the <b>monkeys,</b> <b>and</b> the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate <b>monkeys</b> <b>and</b> dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain.

This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.|$|E
