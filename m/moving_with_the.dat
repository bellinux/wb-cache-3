5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel. The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started <b>moving.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> element of surprise gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E

5|$|Sherwood's four-month sea {{voyage to}} India was difficult; she was again {{pregnant}} and the regiment's ship {{was attacked by}} French warships. The Sherwoods stayed in India for eleven years, <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> army and an ever-increasing family from Calcutta (Kolkata) to Dinapore (Danapur) to Berhampore (Baharampur) to Cawnpore (Kanpur) to Meerut (Meerut). They had six children in India: Henry (1805–1807), Lucy Martha (1807–1808), Lucy Elizabeth (1809–1835), Emily (1811–1833), Henry Martyn (1813–?), and Sophia (1815–?). The deaths of the infants Henry and Lucy Martha and later of young Emily and Lucy Elizabeth affected Sherwood deeply; she frequently named the heroes and heroines of her books (many of whom die) after her late children.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was {{temporarily}} relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army, BSquadron {{was attached to}} the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from Emboli to the Arno River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> division to Iesi on the Adriatic. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to Fano on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini, advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility. Wilder Force was re-formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine-gun platoon and it began crossing the Fiumicino River on 15 October. Four days later, Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles. On 21 October, B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around Pisignano and were within a mile of the town {{by the end of the}} day. Since it was strongly held by the Axis, the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew.|$|E

25|$|Instruments such as {{the laser}} Doppler {{velocimeter}} (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) {{have been developed to}} measure velocities in a fluid flow.

25|$|The Fremen {{manage to}} develop a unique {{relationship}} with the sandworms. They learn to avoid most worm attacks by mimicking the motions of desert animals and <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natural sounds of the desert, rather than the rhythmic vibration patterns that attract worms. However, they also develop a device known as a thumper with {{the express purpose of}} generating a rhythmic vibration to attract a sandworm (see worm charming). This can be used either as a diversion, or to summon a worm for the Fremen to ride.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' first {{definition}} of wave celerity has, for a pure wave motion, the mean {{value of the}} horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity ŪE at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mean horizontal velocity ŪE. This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity ŪE is known, e.g. from measurements.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E

25|$|The speed, {{and thus}} the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by {{choosing}} a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary {{from the point of}} view of an observer <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.|$|E
25|$|Still in action, still <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wind {{away from}} the main fight, were Pallas and the Countess of Scarborough. Alliance was {{catching}} up fast, though, and as the near-undamaged, speedy, well-armed frigate approached, Captain Piercy understood that with seven of his own guns dismounted, four of his crew dead, twenty wounded, his rigging and sails too badly damaged to make a speedy getaway, he could neither win nor escape. With Landais hovering just beyond the range of his guns, he therefore struck his colours. Alliance approached him, seeking to take the Captain’s formal surrender, but after brief exchanges with both Piercy and Cottineau, Captain Landais accepted that his colleague should take the surrender and attend to casualties, while Alliance returned to the main battle. Because the return journey would be against the wind, this would, as Captain Piercy presumably intended, take a while.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Steelers {{moved into}} Heinz Field. The {{franchise}} {{dating back to}} 1933 has had several homes. For thirty-one seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on campus facility before <b>moving</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside. Three Rivers is remembered fondly by the Steeler Nation as where Chuck Noll and Dan Rooney turned the franchise into a powerhouse, winning four Super Bowls in just six seasons and making the playoffs 11 times in 13 seasons from 1972 to 1984, the AFC title game seven times. Since 2001 however {{a new generation of}} Steeler greats has made Heinz Field legendary with multiple AFC Championship Games being hosted and two Super Bowl championships.|$|E
