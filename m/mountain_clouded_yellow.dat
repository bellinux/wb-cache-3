25|$|In a small {{proportion}} of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form helice. The pale form helice {{does not seem to be}} that distinct as intermediates exist and the variation is to some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias sareptensis) and the rarer Pale <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias hyale). Even the palest C. croceus tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings.|$|R

40|$|During {{our field}} survey in the {{south-eastern}} {{part of the}} Republic of Albania, we encountered the Greek <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias aurorina) at two sites, representing the first record for the species in Europe outside Greece. It was found common at one site on the Albanian side of the Grammos Mts. with possibly continuous range into northern Greece. As larval host plant of the Greek <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> Astragalus thracicus was present in abundance on the northern slopes of the mountain, we consider the species as not threatened in Albania. In addition, the purple emperor (Apatura iris) and the Balkan green-veined white (Pieris balcana) were recorded {{for the first time}} in Albania. ...|$|R
