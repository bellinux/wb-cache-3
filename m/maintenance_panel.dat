40|$|Non-hierarchical cluster {{analysis}} for panel data {{is known to}} be hampered by structural preservation, computational complexity and efficiency, and dependency problems. Resolving these issues becomes increasingly important as efficient collection and <b>maintenance</b> of <b>panel</b> data make application more conducive. To address some computational issues and structural preservation, Bonzo [3] presented a stochastic version of Kosmelj and Batagelj's approach [16] to clustering panel data. The method used a probability link function (instead of the usual distance functions) in defining cluster inertias with the aim of preserving the clusters' probabilistic structure. Formulating clustering as an optimization problem, the objective function allows the application of heuristic and stochastic optimization techniques. In this paper, we present a modified heuristic for adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) by perturbing the state vector's sampling distribution, specifically, by perturbing the drift of a diffusion process. Such an approach has been used to hasten convergence towards global optimum at equilibrium for diversely complex, combinatorial, and large-scale systems. The perturbed ASA (PASA) heuristic is then embedded in a genetic algorithm (GA) procedure to hasten and improve the stochastic local search process. The PASA-GA hybrid can be further modified and improved such as by explicit parallel implementation.

40|$|The {{established}} {{approach to}} safety management {{has failed to}} handle socio-technical systems that have become more complex. The main argument is this approach is based on assumptions that systems are protected against accidents by barriers (well-trained people, redundant mechanisms and safety devices, and procedures and safe systems of work). Complex systems, such as maintenance, are actually labour intensive; maintenance staff often works under pressure to finish tasks as rapidly as possible. They continuously adapt and make adjustments using available resources, time, knowledge, and competence to achieve success. Thus, they are accidents prone. Human factors inherent to maintenance accidents are most times difficult to identify. Research in this area in {{the oil and gas}} industry in maintenance management is limited in comparison to the aviation and nuclear sectors. Therefore, it has been suggested to overcome this lack by exploring the maintenance system and identifying appropriate methods and tools that lead a system to safety excellence. Resilience engineering (RE) approach has been found the suitable solution. Moreover, four system abilities (cornerstones of RE: ability to respond, to monitor, to anticipate, and to learn) have been identified to characterise the resilience of a system; if these abilities are known and increased, it will make the system As High Resilient As Possible (AHRAP). However, there is a need to bridge between RE theory and practice. Particularly, a tool that measures these abilities lacks in {{the oil and gas industry}}, specifically within the maintenance system. In doing so, a framework based on a Gap Analysis (GA) was outlined. A tool, the MAintenance System Resilience Assessment Tool- MASRAT, was developed to assess current system resilience and identify strategies for improvement to achieve safety excellence. The maintenance system of SONATRACH was explored by the analysis of the system documentation and processes, interviews with maintenance staff, questionnaires, field observations, storytelling, and functional analysis. MASRAT has been validated by means of congruency and principal components analysis, PCA (content validity), and Cronbach’s alpha (reliability). An expert panel testing was carried out to test its usability. The exploration of the system came up with a snapshot of daily activities as well as a better understanding of the maintenance system. The study identified the most significant human factors (resources, time pressure, and supervision/coordination) and their probable impact on plant safety. The elements of the system were found tightly coupled, hence the system complex. Stories describing the continuous adaptations of people to achieve assigned objectives were collected. On the other hand, MASRAT was validated. All items were rated above 0. 75 in congruency test. The results of PCA for the three selected factors confirmed the items may be clustered after extraction into four components which interpretation represents the four cornerstones of RE. The analysis showed MASRAT is reproducible. Cronbach’s alpha results were found higher than what is required (0. 7). MASRAT was found usable by <b>maintenance</b> expert <b>panel.</b> It was used to measure the maintenance department resilience. Strategies that may lead the system from current maturity level to excellence were identified. Eventually, recommendations were made to management to be implemented both at corporate and department levels. For the first time, the maintenance department resilience of petroleum assets was measured to fill in the gap between RE theory and practice. Besides, this can be of benefit to the petroleum industry by a better knowledge of the maintenance working environment and human factors impact on safety and by profiles determination and improvement strategies identification.

40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between wing rail and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more resilient rail pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing <b>panel</b> <b>maintenance</b> can be reduced...|$|R
