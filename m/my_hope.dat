5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E

If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> to find {{appropriate}} {{child care for}} my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Obama {{undertook}} {{her first}} {{lead role in}} an administration-wide initiative, which she named [...] "Let's Move!," [...] to make progress in reversing the 21st century trend of childhood obesity. On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan towards change. Michelle Obama stated that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: [...] "I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> is that that's {{going to be in}} the area of childhood obesity." [...] Her 2012 book [...] is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating has been echoed by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of recruit obesity.|$|E

500|$|The title story, [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set {{in early}} 19th century Gloucestershire and {{concerns}} the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though {{the events of the}} story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, [...] "For a long time it was <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> that these three ladies should eventually find a place in...the novel...I decided there was no place for them...I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity...it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel." [...] Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the collection and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations". In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons, Victoria Hoyle writes that [...] "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural {{and in the course of}} things." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. <b>My</b> <b>hope</b> is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t is <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E

500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is <b>my</b> <b>hope,</b> President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be <b>my</b> <b>hope,</b> that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was opened by Dobriansky {{followed by a}} rendition of the U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". [...] Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke {{about the significance of}} the monument. [...] Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower, who was chosen to unveil the statue. [...] Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted [...] "We Like Ike!" [...] Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: [...] "For <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> is that your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument {{to the foot of the}} statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world." [...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be." [...] Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem [...] [...] Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction. [...] The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, Shche ne vmerla Ukraina (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).|$|E
