40|$|The {{current flowing}} through a {{separation}} column in CE generates reaction products at the inlet and outlet electrodes. OH- ions generated at the cathode can migrate into the CE column, change pH and thereby electro osmotic flow. These phenomena can be most clearly observed if {{the volume of}} inlet and outlet buffer reservoir is small. In the case of MS coupling, the CE/MS interface mimics the outlet buffer reservoir. When a coaxial <b>make-up</b> <b>liquid</b> is used, the outlet buffer reservoir has a small virtual volume, controlled by the make-up flow. Such volume is essentially zero for a sheathless interface. The effects of electrochemically generated ions has been studied and modifications to a coaxial CE/MS interface are investigated in order to eliminate interaction between interface and column. CE system: PRINCE Technologies programmable injector for CE. Mass spectrometer: NERMAG R 3010 triple quad with home made ESI source and CE/MS interface. The following parameters are monitored with a Sciex API 3 MS data system and a MacLab data acquisition system: mass spectra, UV absorbance, CE current, curtain plate current, orifice plate current, and skimmer current. The effect of OH- ion migration into the column {{is reflected in the}} CE current. We have studied the effect of <b>make-up</b> <b>liquid</b> composition. It appears that a certain concentration of acid is needed to balance the OH- ions. The construction of the CE/MS interface has been modified. The stainless steel capillary which is normally present in a coaxial interface for ESI acts as the out let electrode for the CE column. This SS capillary was replaced by a fused silica capillary, and the outlet electrode was positioned in the <b>make-up</b> <b>liquid</b> line. The effect of position of this electrode is investigated, together with the effects of make-up flow rate and make-up solution composition. The correlation between experimental parameters and signals read by the data systems will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{coupled with}} electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) is a suitable technique {{for the analysis}} of intact proteins. The main configuration to realize this coupling is the sheath liquid interface, which is characterized by the addition of a <b>make-up</b> <b>liquid</b> providing the electric contact as well as the appropriate flow and solvent composition for optimal ionization and evaporation. One main advantage of this interface is that the composition of the sheath liquid can be tuned to modify the ionization without affecting CE selectivity and efficiency. In the case of protein ionization, this feature is particularly interesting to modulate their charge-state distribution (CSD), while keeping the separation performance unchanged. In this context, the current work evaluated the effect on proteinsâ€™ CSD of adding supercharging molecules to the sheath liquid. Several supercharging reagents were tested with different background electrolyte (BGE) and their impact was estimated for three model proteins (i. e., human insulin, human growth hormone, hemoglobin A 0) exhibiting various properties in terms of ionization, conformation, and flexibility. Their influence on the global sensitivity for each protein was also assessed. Among the supercharging reagents tested, m-NBA and sulfolane led to supercharging effect whose magnitude depended on the proteins as well of the BGE pH. The sensitivity and separation performance remained globally unchanged for each protein and supercharging additive, while sulfolane led in some cases to a sensitivity improvement...|$|E
60|$|To steady himself, {{he pressed}} his {{shoulder}} against the white bulkhead, one knee bent, and a sweat-rag tucked in his belt hanging on his hip. His smooth cheek was begrimed and flushed, and the coal dust on his eyelids, like the black pencilling of a <b>make-up,</b> enhanced the <b>liquid</b> brilliance of the whites, giving to his youthful face something of a feminine, exotic and fascinating aspect. When the ship pitched he would with hasty movements of his hands screw hard at the little wheel.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{polyvinyl}} {{alcohol in the}} formulation of safe, improved cosmetic preparations is described. Polyvinyl alcohol has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as a component of topically applied products and is a raw material with unrealized potential for use in cosmetics. The formulation of suntan lotions, cream hair dressings and <b>liquid</b> <b>make-ups</b> containing {{polyvinyl alcohol}} is described. Polyvinyl alcohol acts as a protective colloid in emulsification and has unusual film-forming properties. A method for determining film-forming properties and film strength of cosmetic products containing polyvinyl alcohol is described...|$|R
40|$|During this {{reporting}} period, a ''zinc chromite'' catalyst promoted with 6 wt. % cesium (Cs) {{was evaluated}} {{at the following}} operating conditions: Temperature - 375 C and 400 C; Total Pressure [...] 13. 6 MPa (2000 psig); Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) - 5000 standard liters/kg(cat) -hr; and H{sub 2 }/CO feed ratio [...] 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mole/mole. Decahydronaphthalene (DHN) {{was used as the}} slurry liquid. The experiment lasted for twelve days of continuous operation. Unpromoted zinc chromite catalyst then was re-examined under the same operating conditions. Reproducible data was achieved with a continuous <b>liquid</b> <b>make-up.</b> Compared with unpromoted zinc chromite catalyst, 6 wt. % Cs-promoted catalyst shifted the product distribution from methanol to higher alcohols, even though methanol was still the major product. The effect of operating conditions was less important than the addition of promoter. However, it was observed that higher temperature favors higher alcohol synthesis, and that a higher H{sub 2 }/CO ratio leads to lower oxygenates selectivity and higher hydrocarbons selectivity. These trends showed clearly with the Cs-promoted catalyst, but were not as prominent with the unpromoted catalyst. The slurry liquid did not decompose or alkylate to a measurable extent during either continuous, 12 - day experiment, even with the higher reactor temperature (400 C). There was a relatively significant loss of catalyst surface area during the experiment with the promoted catalyst, but not with the unpromoted catalyst...|$|R
