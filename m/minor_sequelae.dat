40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is the commonest cause of {{acquired}} disability in childhood.

30|$|Results Fifteen of the 20 doctors of {{the team}} {{completed}} the quiz: 6 senior doctors, 4 fellows and 5 residents. The words used to characterize the image were distributed in 2 groups: one with 8 neutral meaning words {{and the other one}} with 10 emotional meaning words. A constant number of neutral words were used to characterize the images (14 – 20), while the number of emotional words varied from 6 to 28 from an image to the other one. For 3 images, the prognostic evaluation agreed with the real clinical evolution. For one image, which was characterized by 6 emotional words, the suspected prognosis was “good” or “doesn’t know” for 14 / 15 doctors. Only one doctor suspected a bad prognosis and proposed a WWLST. This patient drowned and died after a WWLST decision. For the last two images, who were characterized by 24 and 28 emotional words, respectively, the suspected prognosis was “dead” for 8 and 9 / 15 doctors, respectively. Respectively 5 and 10 / 15 proposed a WWLST. These two patients are alive after several years, respectively, without or with <b>minor</b> <b>sequela.</b> To the question “Do you think that a visually impressive image but without pejorative prognosis value for the radiologist risks to weigh wrongly in a decision of WWLST?”, the mean response from 1 (not at all) to 10 (completely) was 5.7. To the question “Do you think that a not very impressive image which has a pejorative prognosis value for the radiologist has less impact on a WWLST decision than a visually impressive image with the same prognosis?”, the mean response was 5.6. Moreover, the doctors express the fact that for every situation clinical assessment is much more important than imaging and express the need to have a radiologist’s and an expert’s point of view for every situation.|$|R

We report five cases of WE secondary to hyperemesis gravidarum. Classic triad of encephalopathy, ataxia, and ocular signs was seen in four out of five patients. Two unusual features noted in this series were papilledema in one patient and severe sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy in one patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was abnormal in all the five patients, and high signal in medial thalamus and surrounding the aqueduct was the most common abnormality (5 / 5). Involvement of caudate nucleus was seen in two patients with severe psychosis, and two patients had bilateral cerebellar peduncle involvement. Median time delay between onset of neurological symptoms and diagnosis was 7 days. All patients improved with thiamine, but <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae</b> were seen in four patients at 12 months follow-up. One patient had a fetal demise.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe study {{aimed to}} assess outcome, {{including}} level of disability, following Japanese encephalitis (JE) in children in Indonesia. MethodsA cohort of children diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed JE from January 2005 to August 2006 was followed-up, with disability measured at least 4 months after discharge from hospital. An assessment tool {{that can be}} used to rapidly determine practical level of disability and the likelihood that a child will be able to live independently after illness, the Liverpool Outcome Score, was used. ResultsOf 72 children with JE, determination of outcome was possible for 65 (90 %). Sixteen died in hospital or before follow-up assessment (25 %). Sixteen children (25 %) had severe sequelae, indicating their function was impaired enough to likely make them dependent. Five (7 %) had moderate sequelae and 12 (18 %) had <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae.</b> The remaining 16 children (25 %) were considered to have recovered fully. ConclusionsHalf of the children with JE either died or were left with serious disabilities likely to impair their ability to lead independent lives, demonstrating the severe impact of JE.

40|$|Management of {{posterior}} fossa {{tumors in}} infants and neonates is challenging. The {{characteristics of the}} young babies make surgery very difficult, sometimes precluding a safe complete removal. Methods: A {{review of the literature}} was undertaken to examine the incidence, histology, surgical aspects, and prognosis of posterior fossa tumors {{in the first year of}} life. Therapeutical strategies of the most frequent tumor types are also discussed in detail. Results: Histology is dominated by tumors with aggressive behavior, such as medulloblastomas, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, and anaplastic ependymomas. The most important surgical considerations in small children are the small circulating blood volume; the poor thermoregulation; and incomplete maturation of the brain, of the skull, and of the soft tissue. Treatment toxicity is inversely related to the age of the patients. Radiation therapy is usually considered as contraindicated in young children, with few exceptions. Proton therapy is a promising tool, but access to this kind of treatment is still limited. The therapeutic limitations of irradiation render resection of this tumor and adjuvant chemotherapy often the only therapeutic strategy in many cases. Conclusions: The overall prognosis remains dismal because of the prevalent aggressive histologies, the surgical challenges, and the limitations of adjuvant treatment. Nevertheless, the impressive improvements in anesthesiology and surgical techniques allow, in the vast majority of the cases, complete removal of the lesions with <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae</b> in high-volume referral pediatric center...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain stem {{herniation}} due to raised {{intracranial pressure}} (ICP) {{is a common}} cause of mortality in severe bacterial meningitis, but continuous measurements of ICP {{and the effects of}} ICP-reducing therapy in these patients have, to our knowledge, not been described. METHODS: During a four-year period, an ICP-monitoring device was implanted in patients admitted to our hospital with severe bacterial meningitis and suspected intracranial hypertension. ICP above 20 mmHg was treated using the Lund Concept, which includes antihypertensive therapy (beta 1 -antagonist,alpha 2 -agonist), normalization of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure and the blood volume, and antistress therapy. RESULTS: ICP above 20 mmHg was found in all 12 patients studied. It was effectively reduced in all but two patients, who died. Both patients had a low cerebral perfusion pressure (< 10 mmHg), dilated pupils at start of therapy and were beyond recovery. Radiological signs of brain swelling were present in only five patients. Seven patients recovered fully, while mild audiological impairment was observed in two and <b>minor</b> neurological <b>sequelae</b> in one patient. Eight patients showed signs suggesting imminent brain stem herniation before start of ICP-reducing treatment, seven of whom had been subjected to diagnostic lumbar dural puncture shortly before development of the brain stem symptoms. These symptoms gradually regressed after initiation of therapy, and in one patient reversal of brain stem herniation was documented by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Severe bacterial meningitis can be associated with increased ICP, which can be reduced using the Lund Concept. The high survival rate, the low frequency of sequelae and the reversal of signs of imminent brain stem herniation in these high-risk patients indicated beneficial effects of the intervention. The study confirms earlier observations that lumbar dural puncture is potentially hazardous in patients with intracranial hypertension, because it may trigger brain stem herniation. A normal CT brain scan does not rule out intracranial hypertension...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to report a rare case with a large brain abscess related to central nervous system immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to discuss the operative strategy for it. Brain abscess with HIV co-infection {{is considered to be}} a critical infectious condition that requires neurosurgical intervention. The presentation of IRIS may worsen the patient’s condition after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, especially in IRIS of the central nervous system. Only a few cases of IRIS-related brain abscess have been reported in the current literature, with discussion of the operative strategy. A 30 -year-old man was diagnosed with HIV infection in 2007 and he developed right-sided convulsion episodes in 2008. His first brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed two intracranial cysts, and his symptoms were well controlled by anticonvulsant treatment. He also initiated antiretroviral therapy in the same year. However, his neurological conditions gradually worsened with sensory loss, weakness, visual impairment on the right side, as well as motor aphasia. A CT scan in 2011 revealed a well-encapsulated, hypodense 8  cm ×  9  cm intracranial lesion in the left frontal parietal lobe with a 3 -cm midline shift. Surgery was performed with a combination of direct suction and quick-suturing of the incision. The abscess capsule was enucleated completely. After surgical removal, he recovered well and remains functional at work in the following year with only <b>minor</b> neurological <b>sequelae.</b> In conclusion, this case illustrates well the clinical course of brain abscess resulting from IRIS in Swaziland, where the prevalence rate of HIV infection is relatively high and delay in diagnosis and treatment is common. The use of a modified excision method for HIV co-infection brain abscess may be considered the operative strategy, with a probable good outcome in such a resource-limited area as Swaziland...|$|R

40|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of an internal carotid artery (ICA) have been admitted in our service since 1979 (incidence of 0, 5 per 100, 000 inhabitants per year). All these patients have been prospectively followed {{in order to determine}} their functional prognosis and a possible recanalization of the ICA. Three patients quickly died from an extensive middle cerebral artery infarct with brainstem compression. Among the 11 survivors, 7 completely recovered their functional ability or were left with very <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae,</b> and could go back to work. The 4 other patients remained with severe sequelae and could not work anymore. In the latter patients Doppler ultrasonographic study showed a persisting occlusion of the ICA, whereas a complete recanalization occurred in the former 7, usually as soon as the first month, on anticoagulant treatment. The presence on admission of a minor or moderate neurological deficit, a normal state of consciousness, an age above 45 years, and a patent collateral circulation allows to predict a favorable evolution (p less than 0. 05). The same is true {{for the development of a}} partial or complete recanalization of the ICA on Doppler ultrasonography performed 2 to 4 weeks after admission. Sex, angiographic aspects of the dissection, and occurrence of headache or warning transient ischemic attacks had no prognostic significance in our study.

40|$|Little is {{understood}} {{about the process}} by which individuals maintain or lose a positive sense of wellbeing {{in the face of a}} chronic disabling condition such as stroke (Clarke, 2003). It appears that the impact of residual impairments and disabilities can pose significant problems for wellbeing in older adults, but the presence of such sequelae is not necessarily correlated with subjective wellbeing – some adapt well while others are devastated by <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae</b> (Clarke, 2003). Additionally, little is known about recovery in stroke survivors in relation to normal ageing processes (Green & King, 2007). Through narrative we bring a sense of order to the disorder in our lives, and gain a sense of temporal continuity as we define ourselves in the context of our experiences (Murray 2008). A qualitative study examined the narratives of a sample of six older people with stroke in the East of Scotland. Participants took part in an episodic interview exploring their experience of stroke and the impact it has had on them and their lives. Narrative analysis was used to explore these stories. A story analytic approach was used to examine the content and structure of stroke narratives. A performative analysis revealed that narrative anchors relating to health, relationships, activity and ageing were used by participants to make sense of stroke, while stroke itself was an anchor point in participants‟ ongoing life stories. These findings were interpreted in relation to theories of ageing, suggesting that a developmental approach may be helpful in understanding the experiences of stroke survivors entering frailty, rather than focussing on the active ageing strategies which benefit those in the younger-old age groups. An approach similar to that used in working with grief is proposed as a framework to help health and social care staff and service users understand the process of adjustment following stroke.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{developed}} a new approach for mapping ventricular tachycardia at electrophysiologic study using simultaneous recordings from up to 60 catheter electrodes. Background. Good results for surgical or catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia are limited by the ability to detect and completely map all of the underlying arrhythmogenic areas. Currently, catheter mapping of all configurations of ventricular tachycardia is impossible or unsatisfactory in at least 60 % of patients because of poorly tolerated rapid rates, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or multiple configurations. Methods. Twenty-four patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs were studied using up to six percutaneous decapolar catheters introduced into the ventricles. Left ventricular maps of ventricular tachycardia were achieved by two to three transseptal catheters, two to three transaortic catheters, a coronary sinus catheter and right ventricular catheters. Simultaneous endocardial maps of either right or left ventricles were possible with a resolution of ~ 1 to 2 cm. Up to 60 electrograms were digitized and recorded simultaneously using a custom-computerized mapping system. Results. Successful maps of 73 ventricular tachycardia configurations were obtained in 22 patients. The mapping procedure failed in two patients because of inability to catheterize the left ventricle in one and inability to induce monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the other. The mean (±SD) ventricular tachycardia cycle length was 285 ± 53 ms (range 215 to 470). A total of 39 separate arrhythmogenic areas (median 1, interquartile [25 % to 75 %] range 1 to 3 /patient) were detected, of which 21 (54 %) were in the left ventricular free wall, 17 (44 %) were in the ventricular septum, and 1 (2 %) {{was in the right}} ventricular outflow tract. Ten patients (45 %) had at least two arrhythmogenic areas. Thirteen patients subsequently underwent operation. All but one of the arrhythmogenic areas found at surgical mapping had been identified at preoperative catheter mapping. Complications of the preoperative mapping procedure occurred in four patients, with complete resolution in three and <b>minor</b> long-term <b>sequelae</b> in the other. Conclusions. This technique permits detailed catheter mapping of all types of monomorphic ventricular tachycardias, including those leading to hemodynamic collapse, and should enable better choice and direction of surgical or catheter ablation...|$|R
40|$|We {{sequentially}} recorded subcortical (P 14) and cortical (N 20) somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 32 patients undergoing deep hypothermic {{circulatory arrest}} (CA). Under normal hemodynamic conditions, hypothermia initially produced N 20 disappearance at a mean nasopharyngeal temperature of 20. 4 +/- 2. 6 degrees C (range 14. 5 to 26. 1 degrees C) and P 14 disappearance at {{a mean of}} 16. 9 +/- 2. 0 degrees C (range 12. 4 to 20. 2 degrees C). On rewarming, P 14 reappeared at mean temperature of 19. 3 +/- 4. 0 degrees C (range 13. 5 to 29. 2 degrees C) and N 20 at a mean of 21. 1 +/- 4. 1 degrees C (range 14. 3 to 29. 6 degrees C). The delay of SEP reappearance after restoration of blood flow correlated significantly with CA duration (r = 0. 74 for P 14, and r = 0. 62 for N 20; p < 0. 01). Neurological recovery was uneventful in 23 patients; 5 patients presented with neurological <b>sequelae</b> (<b>minor</b> or transient in 4; no recovery from anesthesia and death after 48 hours in 1), and 4 patients died during operation. Twenty-three of 24 surviving patients in whom P 14 disappearance was the criterion that hypothermia was deep enough to perform CA (duration: 17 to 94 min) had a normal neurological outcome. By contrast, all surviving patients in whom cortical SEPs disappeared at higher temperatures presented neurological sequelae. In conclusion, the neurophysiological monitoring of brain stem activity, as specifically provided by SEPs, enables determination of the optimal temperature for CA, and demonstrates superiority of SEP monitoring {{over the use of}} EEG...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cerebrovascular {{accident}} or stroke {{is currently the}} main cause of neurological disability in Nigeria with devastating impact on the person’s physical, psychological, and social functioning. Some stroke survivors are able to adapt to their disabilities while others are devastated even by a <b>minor</b> <b>sequelae.</b> In the Nigerian healthcare model, the focus is on survival only, thus overshadowing all other, broader Quality of life (QOL) issues. This study aims to determine the factors that {{have an impact on the}} quality of life of stroke survivors and to highlight why and how these individuals retain or lose their sense of wellbeing after stroke in Kano, Nigeria. Method: This is a mixed-method study conducted in three phases on 233 stroke survivors in Kano, Nigeria. Phase I is the validation of the primary tools for the measurement of QOL and social support. Phase II (quantitative phase) is a longitudinal study to identify the domain specific covariates (predictors) of QOL at 6 months and 1 year after stroke. In Phase III (qualitative phase), data were collected via in-depth interviews with 15 participants with the aim to explore the factors identified in Phase II. Correlations and stepwise linear regression model were used to determine the domain specific covariates (predictors) of QOL, whilst thematic analysis using constant comparative methods aided by NVivo 9 software was used to analyse the qualitative data. Finally, an integration of the phases for an overall presentation of the health-related quality of life of these survivors was discussed. Results: The 16 -item Hausa (language) version of the Stroke Impact Scale (Hausa-SIS) 3. 0 ’s 8 domains (strength, hand function, mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), emotion, memory, communication and social participation) was found to be psychometrically fit and have good coverage of Quality Of Life (QOL) construct. In the final analysis, a parsimonious model was obtained with two items for each of the 8 constructs. The 11 -item Hausa version of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Hausa-MSPSS) was found to be reliable and acceptable for the assessment of perceived social support among stroke survivors in Nigeria. A two-factor model with Family and Friends as the two domains was found to be acceptable. Phase II results showed that among the eight dimensions of QOL, all dimensions excluding the emotional domain, showed significant improvement at 1 year after stroke. However, social support was significantly decreased from 6 months to 1 year after stroke v (p< 0. 005). Linear regression showed that the factors found to be most predictive of satisfactory QOL at 6 months after stroke are being employed, enough income, presence of a caregiver, acceptance at work place, higher level of education, side of stroke, less dependency in conducting activities of daily living (Barthel Index Score), urban residency, lower degree of disability (Modified Rankin Score), and higher degree of social support. The factors “reasonable hospital treatment charges” and “perceived social support by friends” were found to be additional predictors of satisfactory QOL at 1 year after stroke. Withdrawal of support by significant others was the sole factor associated (p< 0. 05) with unsatisfactory QOL at both 6 months and at 1 year after stroke. The qualitative study revealed that in addition to the factors above, the availability and accessibility of spiritual and religious resources as well as the ability to perform sexually and other functions and the received social support helped the stroke survivors to improve the emotional domain of their QOL. Conclusion: Stroke has debilitating consequences affecting many aspects of functioning and living. To improve the QOL of the stroke survivors, it is recommended that programs that focus on meeting their needs such as re-employment, religious and socio-cultural activities plus continual social and financial support should be developed and given to them as part of a holistic rehabilitation program for stroke patients and survivors.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether treatment with a local potent corticosteroid during adjuvant external radiotherapy (ERT) of breast cancer is associated with late skin toxicity. Material and methods: Sixty patients (32 treated with potent corticoid cream versus 28 controls treated with moisturizer) who had been included in a randomized study on prophylactic local corticosteroid treatment under adjuvant ERT in 2009 and 2010 were subjected to a follow-up study in 2016. Assessments of skin texture were registered according to the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme (RTOG). Dryness, skin colour and skin thickness were objectively measured using non-invasive instruments. The patients were assessed for differences between their treated and untreated breasts. Results: Skin atrophy was not noticed in any of the 60 patients. Objective instrumental measurements did not reveal any significant differences in skin dryness, colour, pigmentation or skin thickness over the average follow-up time of six years. Clinical assessment based on the RTOG scoring system revealed that the odds ratio of having late skin problems in patients treated with moisturizer compared to patients treated with corticosteroid was 3. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 0 â 10. 1). Patients reported <b>minor</b> cosmetic dermatological <b>sequelae.</b> Seven patients developed telangiectasia, which caused cosmetic inconvenience. Conclusion: In this study, prophylactic corticosteroid treatment to ameliorate radiation dermatitis during adjuvant ERT of breast cancer was not associated with an increase in late skin toxicity nor did it result in skin atrophy. This study is limited by its small sample size, and the risk for false positive findings.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia from vasospasm {{is a major}} complication after aneurysmal {{subarachnoid hemorrhage}} (SAH), but complications and/or low efficacy are associ-ated with current therapy. We report our initial experience with intra-arterial use of a calcium channel blocker, nicardipine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with clinical and angiographic vasospasm treated with intra-arterial nicardipine was performed. Standard criteria for definition of significant, intractable vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH were used. After catheter angiographic confirmation of vasospasm, arteries showing severe narrowing were targeted for super-selective catheterization. Nicardipine was infused at a high dose rate (0. 415 – 0. 81 mg/min). Contrast injections were performed at 2 – 5 -mg intervals to assess effective response (a 60 % increase in arterial diameter of the most severely decreased in caliber vessel compared with the very first angiographic run). RESULTS: Eleven consecutive patients underwent a total of 20 procedures; most had SAH with high Hunt and Hess grades (III or IV). All had depressed level of consciousness; others had paresis (7 / 20, 35 %), aphasia (1 / 20, 5 %), and facial nerve palsy (1 / 20, 5 %). Between 10 and 40 mg of nicardipine was used. A 60 % increase in diameter of the main affected artery compared with the initial diameter measured in the initial angiographic run was achieved in all procedures. Clinical improvement (resolved focal symptoms or increased Glasgow Coma Score) occurred in 10 of 11 patients (91 %). One patient died from complications of the initial hemorrhage. No complications occurred after 16 of 20 procedures (80 %); <b>minor</b> complications without <b>sequelae</b> occurred after the remaining procedures. Follow-up of at least 2 months in 10 survivors revealed minor or no deficits in most patients with a Glasgow Outcom...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{incidence}} of {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) {{is estimated to be}} about 1 - 2 / 1000 per year of which approximately 4 % are located in the arm veins. Some of the most important late effects of a DVT are chronic venous dysfunction and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Objective diagnosis with detailed information on disease extent and location and global venous function is often important for clinical management of the patient. Color duplex ultrasonography (CDU) and computerized strain-gauge plethysmography (CSGP) are currently available non-invasive methods to study venous function after earlier DVT. Aims The aim of this thesis was to study venous function after earlier deep venous thrombosis assessed by CDU and CSGP; to study how findings with those methods are related to long-term sequelae, and development of postthrombotic diseases after different types of DVT. Study I and II These studies were performed to assess the efficiency of CSGP for evaluation of venous outflow capacity of the upper extremities, to receive reference values and to describe venous function using CSGP and CDU in patients with earlier primary upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT). Thirty-four healthy controls and 32 patients with earlier UEDVT were included. The results showed that CSGP is easy to handle and {{can be used in a}} reproducible way to study venous function in the upper extremities. CSGP reference values were established for upper extremities. Patients with earlier UEDVT had reduced venous outflow, residual thrombus was a common finding, and one third had a moderate grade of PTS. CSGP and CDU are useful methods that can provide objective information regarding venous function after UEDVT. Study III This study was performed to determine whether asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (ADVT) following minor surgery affects venous function and contributes to development of PTS. Eighty-three patients operated for Achilles tendon rupture were included; 38 patients with postoperative ADVT and 45 patients without (control group). The follow-up examinations five years after the operation consisted of CSGP, CDU and clinical scoring. More than 50 % of patients with ADVT developed post-thrombotic changes according to CDU, but these changes did not affect global venous function. Eight percent of ADVT patients and 4 % of control group patients developed PTS. Therefore, PTS is not a common sequel to ADVT after minor orthopaedic surgery. Study IV This follow-up study included 83 patients with postoperative DVT examined after a mean of 7 years. There was two series of patients, 45 with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (SDVT) and 38 with ADVT. The objective was to describe long-term effect of SDVT and ADVT on venous function and subsequent {{incidence of}} PTS in patients operated for Achilles tendon rupture. Examinations comprised CSGP, CDU and clinical scoring. The results showed that post-operative DVT after minor surgery consists mainly of distal DVTs and is associated with a low risk for PTS, found in approximately 10 % of the patients. Deep venous reflux was more common in SDVT than in ADVT patients (84 % vs. 55 %). Abnormal plethysmographic results were seen in only a few patients without difference between the two groups. This indicates that DVT provoked by minor orthopaedic surgery represents a transient risk factor with <b>minor</b> long-term <b>sequelae.</b> In summary This thesis concerns studies of venous function and evaluation of clinical sequelae and frequency of PTS in patients with previous primary upper extremity DVT and in patients with postoperative DVT following minor orthopaedic surgery. In general, these studies show that the clinical signs as well as symptoms stated by the patients in these types of DVT are rather non-specific and often consist of pain, paresthesias, cramps, swelling and functional impairment. Therefore, in addition to the clinical examination, objective assessment of venous function and evaluation of the extent of disease are of value. Ultrasonograhy and plethysmograpy are non-invasive tests that can be used for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Infants born {{extremely}} prematurely (ie. < 29 weeks gestation) or with {{extremely low}} birth weight (ie. < 1000 grams) are at high-risk of major and <b>minor</b> motor <b>sequelae</b> that persist into the school years. Most {{of the research on}} the outcome of these high-risk infants has concentrated on the prevalence of major disability. The majority of high-risk children at school age have normal intelligence and no sensorineural disability. Despite this, these &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children have a higher incidence of minor morbidities. Motor coordination problems are frequently reported, yet further investigation into the emergence of minor motor dysfunction, or its impact on academic achievement and everyday activities is seldom explored. The aim of this thesis was to provide a comprehensive investigation into motor dysfunction, which is commonly found in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children. This was addressed in a series of five studies that intended to provide insight into the emergence, prevalence, nature, and prediction of motor dysfunction in otherwise &# 145;normal&# 146; high-risk children. Study 1 examined the development of gross and fine motor skills from infancy to school age using a longitudinal cohort study design. &# 145;Apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children (n= 58) were assessed with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales at 18 months corrected age, 3 and 5 years. A significant proportion continued to have fine motor deficits to school age (64 %), reflecting a persistent problem with fine motor skills throughout this period. The proportion of infants with gross motor deficits significantly increased from 18 months to 5 years (81. 1 %), particularly for the &# 145;micropreemies&# 146;. Whilst there was no gender difference found, the development of gross and fine motor skills appeared to be influenced differently by the home environment. Study 2 examined the impact of motor dysfunction on performance at school age. The prevalence of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children was determined using a controlled cohort study design. In addition, the nature of DCD in this population was explored by testing sensorimotor abilities that possibly underlie the motor dysfunction. Fifty (50) high-risk children with IQ< 85 and no identified sensorineural disability were assessed at 8 years of age along with a matched control from their respective class at school. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and a battery of sensorimotor tests were administered. Results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of DCD (42 %) in the high-risk group in comparison to the control group (8 %). In relation to sensorimotor abilities that may influence motor performance, the high-risk group scored significantly lower on most of tests, however it was neurological &# 145;soft signs&# 146;, postural praxis, and sequencing praxis that contributed to DCD in the high-risk group. Study 3 was designed to investigate the impact of motor dysfunction on a motor-based task performed within the school setting. Specifically, this study described handwriting skills in &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children, determined the prevalence of handwriting dysfunction, and investigated sensorimotor abilities that may be associated with problematic handwriting. The high-risk cohort and matched controls described in study 2 were also administered a number of handwriting tests. High-risk children were found to have poorer handwriting legibility and speed in comparison to their classmates. The prevalence of handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk group was 46 %, significantly higher than controls (18 %). Hand preference, pencil grasp used, and pain whilst writing were comparable to the control group. The contribution of underlying sensorimotor abilities to handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk population however was not evident. By using the same subjects in studies 2 and 3, the co-morbidity of handwriting dysfunction with DCD could be determined. Of those high-risk children identified with DCD, 43 % had co-morbid handwriting dysfunction. Study 4 explored the relationship between perinatal and environmental variables to Developmental Coordination Disorder and handwriting dysfunction in high-risk children. Perinatal and environmental variables of the 50 &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk children that participated in the previous study were analysed. Results indicated prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were significantly and independently associated with DCD, perhaps reflecting the impact of the antenatal infection process and visual development related to ROP on motor outcome in high-risk children. Perinatal variables were not associated with handwriting dysfunction, but high-risk males {{were more likely to have}} handwriting dysfunction. Maternal education and paternal occupation were associated with aspects of handwriting. Whilst handwriting is a motor-based activity, it appears to be influenced by environmental variables, similar to other academic areas for the high-risk population. Study 5 sought to determine whether a motor assessment at an earlier age could predict DCD in the &# 145;apparently normal&# 146; high-risk population at school age. Motor assessment at 12 months, 3 and 5 years for the high-risk subjects who participated in study 2 were analysed using Receiver Operator Curves (ROC curves). The 3 year assessment with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales was the best predictor of DCD at 8 years, with the Griffiths Locomotor Scale at 3 years yielding a similar result. Findings suggest that high-risk children who scored below the specified cut-off points on 3 year motor assessments and who had a history of PROM or ROP were at greater risk of having motor-based problems that had the potential to interfere with functioning at school...|$|R
