40|$|Background: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble {{receptor}} of the tumour necrosis factor family, and its ligand, the receptor activator {{of nuclear}} factor-κB ligand (RANKL), are emerging as important regulators of vascular pathophysiology. Objectives: We evaluated {{their effects on}} vasculogenesis induced by endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) and on neovessel formation in vivo. Methods: Effects of OPG and RANKL on in vitro angiogenesis were evaluated after ECFC incubation with OPG or RANKL (0 – 50 ng mL− 1). Effects on microvessel formation were evaluated with an in vivo murin Matrigel plug assay. Vascularization was evaluated by <b>measuring</b> <b>plug</b> hemoglobin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -R 2 content 14 days after implantation. Results: We found that ECFC expressed OPG and RANK but not RANKL mRNA. Treatment of ECFC with VEGF or stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) upregulated OPG mRNA expression. OPG stimulated ECFC migration (P < 0. 05), chemotaxis (P < 0. 05) and vascular cord formation on Matrigel® (P < 0. 01). These effects were correlated with SDF- 1 mRNA overexpression, which was 30 -fold higher after 4 h of OPG stimulation (P < 0. 01). OPG-mediated angiogenesis involved the MAPK signaling pathway as well as Akt or mTOR cascades. RANKL also showed pro-vasculogenic effects in vitro. OPG combined with FGF- 2 promoted neovessel formation in vivo, whereas RANKL had no effect. Conclusions: OPG induces ECFC activation and is a positive regulator of microvessel formation in vivo. Our {{results suggest that the}} OPG/RANK/RANKL axis may be involved in vasculogenesis and strongly support a modulatory role in tissue revascularization...|$|E

The core plugs are all fine- to medium-grained, Franciscan-assemblage (late Mesozoic) metagraywacke with sparse Franciscan metamorphic quartz-calcite veins and late Cenozoic, hydrothermal quartz-calcite-pyrite veins. The matrices of three plugs from the caprock are rich in metamorphic mixed-layer illite/smectite and disseminated hydrothermal pyrite; the reservoir plug instead contains abundant illite and only minor pyrite. The reservoir plug and one caprock plug are sparsely disrupted by latest-stage, unmineralized microfractures which both follow and crosscut veinlets but which could be artifacts. Porosities of the <b>plugs,</b> <b>measured</b> by Boyles-law gas expansion, range between 1. 9 and 2. 5 %.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide ‘semi-quantitative’ or ‘rigorous’ definitions of the fluidity, lubricity and compactibility requirements of formulation for representative dosator and dosing disc capsule filling machines. To that end, model formulations were developed for those properties using Carr's compressibility index, ejection force, and plug breaking force at a specified compression force to gauge fluidity, lubricity, and compactibility, respectively. These formulations were each encapsulated on an Hofliger-Karg GKF- 400 dosing disc machine and a Zanasi LZ- 64 dosator machine. Each machine was instrumented to <b>measure</b> <b>plug</b> compression and ejection forces. The encapsulation process was evaluated for %CV of fill-weight, ejection force, plug breaking force and the dissolution of marker drugs incorporated in the formulations. The f 2 metric was used to compare dissolution profiles. The results suggest: (1) formulations should meet different flow criteria for successful encapsulation on the two machines, (2) a relatively lower level of lubricant may be sufficient for the dosing disc machine, (3) a higher degree of formulation compactibility is needed for the dosator machine, and (4) transferring formulations between these machine types (same class, different subclass per FDA's SUPAC-IR/MR Manufacturing Equipment Addendum) could be challenging. In certain cases dissolution profiles for the same formulation filled on the two machines with equivalent compression force were different based on f 2 < 50.

40|$|Plug loads—traditionally {{viewed as}} behaviorally {{motivated}} {{and beyond the}} control of designers and operations—are now seen {{as an integral part of}} achieving low-energy building targets. Higher education institutions are increasingly recognizing the environmental impacts of campus facilities through holistic approaches to energy savings including energy efficient design and occupant engagement. Residence halls are a compelling example because students bring large numbers of electronics to their rooms and have unlimited access to power for an all-inclusive room rate and resource usage competitions and campaigns are commonplace. However, limited research exists on residence halls plug loads. This dissertation asked the following of residence halls: (1) What are the <b>measured</b> <b>plug</b> loads and how do they compare with design estimates? (2) What role do building design characteristics play in plug loads? (3) What are the specific occupant behaviors that could influence future design? (4) How can plug loads be better understood in terms of behavior, design, and operations? To answer these questions, a sequential mixed methods study included field measurements and student surveys in six residence halls on three Oregon campuses followed by 24 interviews with designers, operators, and students. Findings suggest that plug loads in occupied residence halls are higher and usage profiles differ from design predictions. Results do not show significant correlations between design characteristics and plug loads but suggest that some room/suite level features may play a somewhat stronger role. Survey responses indicated that students are doing more with fewer smart devices, which suggests opportunities for students sharing energy intensive devices. Lighting emerged as both a practical and a social consideration. Finally, the data revealed “balance of power” as a coherent process that explicates the relationships between design, operations, and behavior. Designers have the power to recommend plug load strategies and technologies but are limited by costs, maintenance, and political concerns; operations personnel have the power to impose limits on student power usage but are often reluctant to interfere with the overall living experience; and students have the power to use plug load electricity with few restrictions. This suggests that the balance may be skewed toward student behavior...|$|R

30|$|Permeability, {{which is}} a measure of the ability of porous medium to {{transmit}} fluids, is an important parameter required in many areas, such as reservoir engineering, hydrology, and environmental engineering. Anisotropy of permeability or multi directional permeability calculation is also crucial for understanding the directions of potential permeable fluid migration, for example, in volcanic rocks (Wright et al. 2006). Measurements of permeability in the laboratory on core samples are usually conducted in one direction while the permeability in the other direction must be obtained by <b>measuring</b> different core <b>plugs</b> (Farquharson et al. 2016). Since permeability of rocks varies due to their pore structures heterogeneity and also depends on the direction of the measurements, different core plugs may give different results.

The density, viscosity and surface tension of the ionic liquid [C 4 mim][NTf 2] are 1420 kg/m 3, 0. 029 Pa·s and 31. 92 mN/m respectively.

Samples cored with different orientations {{with respect to the}} sedimentary bedding were prepared and tested in their native saturated state and after drying in the oven at 105 °C for 24 hr to assess the effect of fluids and of the sediment anisotropy on attenuation. To aid the interpretation of the experimental results, the clay-rich samples were characterized in terms of mineralogy, water content, porosity, permeability and microstructure. The two shales have significantly different quality factors; and this is seen to be dependent on both the saturation state of the samples and the propagation direction of the oscillatory signal. The attenuation coefficient for compression/extension parallel to bedding is less than that vertical to bedding in both the preserved and partially dehydrated situations. No frequency dependency is observed in the preserved samples within the range of frequencies explored in this study. On the other hand partially saturated samples show peaks in attenuation at around 40 Hz when the stress perturbation is transmitted normal to the macroscopic bedding. The interpretation of the attenuation measurements in terms of well-established theoretical models is discussed in view of the physical characteristics and microstructure of the tested rock...|$|R

Matrix increases with depth. <b>Measured</b> core <b>plug</b> mean porosity is 32 % (± 3) and mean permeability is 1513 md (± 872). Point count porosity, dominated by primary intergranular porosity, is 24 % (± 10). Formation waters, sampled during the sequestration experiment, exhibited a rapid decrease in pH and increases in alkalinity and dissolved metals (Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, & Mo). In an effort to identify the source of ions in solution, XRD and SEM analyses were completed. XRD and SEM analyses identify illite/smectite clay coats with rare amounts of kaolinite. SEM with EDAX analyses identified authigenic pyrite, occurring as framboids and euhedral crystals, and lesser amounts of quartz and feldspar overgrowths, and barite. Secondary porosity, through the dissolution of feldspar, is also observed (1 % ± 1). EDAX analysis of clay grain coats identifies Fe, Si, O, Al, K, Na, and Mg and BSE identifies pyrites (≤ 1 μm) intergrown with the clays. Electron microprobe analyses of euhedral and framboidal pyrite were conducted to quantify trace element concentrations. Microprobe analyses identified Mn as the dominant trace element associated with these upper Frio Formation pyrites, indicating that pyrite serves as the source for Fe and Mn ions identified in the formation waters. Alteration mechanisms of the pyrite, allowing the release of Fe and Mn into solution, are still unknown though may result from surface complexes created when the pyrite is exposed to increasing HCO 3 - concentrations- a by-product of CO 2 injection. These data are essential in understanding the chemical changes occurring in the formation and assisting in a model simulation of the Frio sandstone’s chemical reactive properties, all in response to increased CO 2 concentrations. This research supports the GCCC’s CO 2 sequestration efforts, assessing the Frio Formation as a repository for anthropogenic CO 2, and ultimately, atmospheric CO 2 reductionDepartment of GeologyThesis (M.

40|$|Oolitic grainstones {{can contain}} {{significant}} hydrocarbon reserves. The heterogeneity in carbonate reservoir ascribes to the depositional and digenetic processes. Within the studied interval, facies were analyzed and grouped into four depositional sub-environment which stacked in five cycle sets (4 th order sequences). The porosity and permeability were <b>measured</b> from core <b>plug</b> of outcrop samples. However, the measured porosity and permeability values showed patterns of distributions when statistically analyzed {{based on the}} rock typing and stratigraphic intervals. Based on the outcrop observations, the 3 D framework was constructed which comprises of five zones separated by six surfaces. In the context of depositional environment, these zones are; foreshoal and shoal (zones 1 and 2), shoal and backshoal (zones 3 and 4) and tidal flat deposits (zone 5). The sea level within these zones was relatively high, fluctuated and dropped within deposits of zones 1 and 2, zones 3 and 4 and zone 5, respectively. In the context of 3 D modelling, lithofacies within each zone was populated separately by using different geostatistical algorithm. Based on the relative sea level, the dominated lithofacies and {{the presence or absence}} of marine fauna, the studied interval was subdivided into three broad intervals. These intervals are; lower (zones 1 and 2), middle (zones 3 and 4) and the upper interval (zone 5). The porosity evolution was investigated within each zone and incorporated within the 3 D outcrop model. The results showed how the incorporation of the porosity scenarios within the 3 D framework can provide a realistic and to some extent the exact vertical stacking of reservoir units. This approach could be applied to predict and enhance the reservoir quality in the analogous oolitic reservoir...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTight chalk {{intervals}} play a {{major role}} in North-Sea hydrocarbon fields, by controlling fluid flow pathways of hydrocarbon and water. Recent studies reveal that low-permeability chalk properties are dependent on clay content and cementation. Therefore, in this research, three characteristic samples were selected: (A) a porous micritic chalk, (B) a cemented chalk and (C) an argillaceous chalk. Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) analyses were performed and 3 D pore networks were reconstructed for each sample. By using MATLAB® and Avizo® softwares, relevant pore data were extracted, including pore volumes, lengths and network tortuosity. Results show that the pore length is reduced in tight chalks, with 140 nm on average in argillaceous chalk and 533 nm in cemented chalk, compared to 1091 nm in micritic reservoir chalk. Pore shape analysis demonstrates that, when present, clay flakes are predominant. Argillaceous chalk displays 35 % of flattened pores, while these represent only 15 and 18 % of pores in micritic and cemented chalk respectively. Virtual rock porosity calculated from FIB-SEM is consistent with helium porosity lab-measurements. MICP pore-throat diameters also match calculated pore widths. These preliminary findings confirm the potential of FIB-SEM analyses in characterizing chalks porous media. In order to understand fluid transport, fluid flow was simulated on each sample using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), which allows visualising fluid pathways and calculating permeabilities. Simple phase LBM-modelled permeabilities are on the same order of magnitude as gas permeabilities <b>measured</b> on centimetric <b>plugs</b> with Klinkenberg correction. This means that the pore network characterized by FIB-SEM has a significant contribution to macroscopic fluid transport. The impact of clay content and cementation degree on total porosity and pore shapes in chalk is a key finding, which requires to be accounted for, e. g. in mesoscale fluid flow modelling...|$|R
