5|$|A {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} recognition of Peleinae and Patholopinae, comprising the genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested the inclusion of Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> supports the inclusion of Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> of the carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, {{meaning that the}} phylogenetic relationships between the {{epaulette shark}} and its sister species could not be resolved.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, a <b>morphological</b> {{component}} <b>analysis</b> method [41] {{has been}} proposed and widely used in image processing. The main idea of <b>morphological</b> component <b>analysis</b> is to divide the image contents into different components, such as smooth, texture, and contour. As DCT is a tool that can effectively depict periodic signals, we perform DCT on image blocks and then classify the image blocks into different morphological components according to their respective energies of the alternating current (AC) coefficients.|$|R
5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{was thought}} to be saprotrophic, and has been {{described}} in this manner in both scholarly and popular discussions of the species. However, this classification was the result of its taxonomic history and comparisons with saprotrophic fungi that are not closely related. After its assignment to the Sclerodermatineae, a suborder whose members are ectomycorrhizal, its ecological role came into question. In 2007, Andrew Wilson and David Hibbett of Clark University and Eric Hobbie of the University of New Hampshire employed isotopic labeling, DNA sequencing, and <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> to determine that this species is also ectomycorrhizal. Like all mycorrhizal fungi, C.cinnabarinum establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of trees, allowing the fungus to exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of the tree. This association is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The only host trees identified for C.cinnabarinus are Quercus oaks, although related members of Calostoma have been observed to associate with other trees in the Fagaceae family, such as beech.|$|E
5|$|Prominent Swedish {{entomologist}} Carl Stål {{named the}} genus Abricta in 1866, {{and it was}} either treated as a subgenus of the genus Tibicen or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as Tibicen curvicostus, and Abricta curvicosta from 1906. French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada tephrogaster (later Tibicen tephrogaster) in 1835; this has long been considered a junior synonym. However, {{a review of the}} genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. Max Moulds conducted a <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14species, and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta, while most of the others were placed in the genus Tryella. The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors: A.curvicosta has a larger forewing size– rarely less than 3.2cm (1.3in) and usually over 4cm (1.6in), whereas Tryella is never above 3.2cm (1.3in); the uncal lobes of Aleetas distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of Tryella are upturned. The name Aleeta is derived from the Greek aleton meaning flour or meal.|$|E

We describe algorithms that exploit the spectral, textural and object shape information using hierarchical feature extraction and decision making steps for automatic mapping of linear strips of woody vegetation in very high-resolution imagery.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{describes}} a new method for blind source separation, {{adapted to the}} case of sources having different morphologies. We show that such morphological diversity leads to a new and very efficient separation method, even in the presence of noise. The algorithm, coined multichannel <b>morphological</b> component <b>analysis</b> (MMCA), is an extension of the <b>morphological</b> component <b>analysis</b> (MCA) method. The latter takes advantage of the sparse representation of structured data in large overcomplete dictionaries to separate features in the data based on their morphology. MCA {{has been shown to be}} an efficient technique in such problems as separating an image into texture and piecewise smooth parts or for inpainting applications. The proposed extension, MMCA, extends the above for multichannel data, achieving a better source separation in those circumstances. Furthermore, the new algorithm can efficiently achieve good separation in a noisy context where standard independent component analysis methods fail. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is confirmed in numerical experiments. Index Terms—Blind source separation, <b>morphological</b> component <b>analysis</b> (MCA), sparse representations.

25|$|Critics of the Ichthyostraca {{hypothesis}} {{have pointed}} out that even parasitic crustaceans can still be recognised as crustaceans based on their larvae; but that tongue worms and their larvae do not express typical characters for Crustacea or even Euarthropoda.

A recent <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> recovered Pentastomida outside the arthropods, as sister group to a clade including nematodes, priapulids and similar ecdysozoan 'worm' groups. Adding fossils, they suggested an extinct animal called Facivermis could be closely related to tongue worms. However it should be stressed that these authors did not explicitly test pentastomid/crustacean relationships.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} {{works on a}} phonetic {{transliteration}} of Tunisian, linguists decided that the transliteration should be mainly syntactic. Timothy Buckwalter created an orthography-based transcription of Arabic texts during his work for Xerox. Buckwalter transcription was created {{in order to avoid}} the effect of phoneme simplification of spoken Modern Standard Arabic on the <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis</b> of the language. In 2004, Tunisian linguist Mohamed Maamouri proposed to use the same transliteration for Arabic dialects and mainly Tunisian. This idea was later developed by Nizar Habash and Mona Diab in 2012 into CODA-based Buckwalter transliteration that eliminates phonological simplification in the Arabic dialects through doing comparisons between dialectal structures and their Modern Standard Arabic equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{there are}} {{problems}} in basing the analysis on a single type of character, such as a single gene or protein or only on <b>morphological</b> <b>analysis,</b> because such trees constructed from another unrelated data source often differ from the first, and therefore great care is needed in inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and recombination, where different haplotype blocks can have different histories. In general, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis is {{an estimate of the}} characters phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the taxa (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should be very close. For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes), or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that homoplasy (false homology) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.|$|E
