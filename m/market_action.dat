She argues that [...] "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film Die Hard 2 are very violent, but they do [...] "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".|$|E

We theorise, firstly, that the relationship between EO and performance is mediated by the firm’s technology and <b>marketing</b> <b>action</b> and secondly, that these mediating effects will differ by industry. We test the model on 489 Korean SMEs. Results indicate both technology and <b>marketing</b> <b>action</b> mediate the effect of EO on performance. As expected, technology action has a stronger mediating effect than <b>marketing</b> <b>action</b> in manufacturing industries, while <b>marketing</b> <b>action</b> has a stronger mediating effect in service industries.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show {{marketing}} practitioners how to use econometric models to assess the effect of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions.</b> We use a database that includes the four competitors of a personal care product in Colombia with limited information for a period of six years. The study evaluates the effects of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on sales revenues for the three product subcategories: premium, midprice, and value. The results show that these effects are different for the three subcategories. This suggests that there is no general model to predict the consequences of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on sales revenues; marketers need to use statistical methods to assess the effect of their decisions. Finally, although our results cannot be extrapolate to other product categories or countries, our approach can be used to assess the impact of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on sales revenues in other product categories and industries...|$|R

The research analyzes the role of <b>market</b> <b>actions</b> related to innovation, pricing and promotion, and non-market actions related to judicial issues. The study finds that first movers enjoy a sustainable market share advantage in this service industry, but that this advantage depends on the type of actions taken by pioneers and followers. Specifically, followers that take more <b>market</b> <b>actions</b> than the pioneer are not able to erode the first-mover's advantage. However, followers taking more non-market actions - such as litigation and complaints - are successful at taking market share from the pioneer.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{explores the}} effectiveness of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on a firm’s intangible assets and subsequently its financial assets. An index is developed to monitor and track changes in intangible marketing assets, namely brand equity and customer equity in the long term. Originality: The thesis aims to measure the impact of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on brand building effects and subsequently firm value. It will propose a new methodology for measuring the impact of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> on firm value. Long term <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> are tested for their impact on marketing assets such as brand equity and customer equity, ultimately linking marketing assets to firm value. Methodology: Secondary data analysis and a case study method are the principle techniques applied in this study. A combination of firm internal data, external databases (e. g. COMPUSTAT), and consumer survey data will be used. In order to explore the dynamics of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> long term, we apply a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM). Contribution: This study makes a contribution by controlling two series of variables: first, variables which affect marketing performance in long term such as the marketing mix inertia and seasonality. The second control mechanism relates to variables which affect brand equity measurement such as country characteristics and industry characteristics. In addition this research considers the impact of various long term dynamic factors such as customer response, competitor response (competition) and economic context. Research limitations/implications: One of the major {{limitations of this study}} is data availability to measure the dynamic factors and control variables. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the theory that}} modern technologies are changing {{the way in which}} marketing is organised and that they will transform the prevailing composition of the market, while enterprises should {{come to terms with the}} act that having a market share will no longer suffice to maintain the market leader position. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the key challenges generated by technological innovations and to identify the opportunities for marketing in light of the new communication and information technologies so that quantifiable benefits can be gained. The research topic underpinning this paper is: 1) an analysis of social media use by the Millennial generation; 2) an evaluation of the attitudes of SMEs towards the incorporation of information technology into their current marketing practices; 3) determining the implementation possibilities of Marketing 4. 0 by promoting a flexible approach to organising <b>marketing</b> <b>actions.</b> Following a review of the available literature on the subject, we will present a concept of the model of the flexible organisation of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions.</b> The D 3 I 2 C concept combines today’s <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> and digital transformation. It can be harnessed by academia and other organisations seeking guidance on the implementation of transformation in the organisation of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Conference and Theory + Practice Conference {{for their}} {{valuable}} suggestions. Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators because they represent their brand’s health and are readily connected to marketing activity. However, {{this does not}} mean that financially focused executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose four criteria – potential, responsiveness, stickiness and sales conversion – that determine the connection between <b>marketing</b> <b>actions,</b> attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes. We test our approach with a rich dataset of four-weekly <b>marketing</b> <b>actions,</b> attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> affect sales performance through their differential impact on attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly stable over time, but differ substantially acros...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} and pervasiveness of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions,</b> almost nothing {{is known about the}} neural mechanisms through which it affects the decisions made by individuals. We propose that <b>marketing</b> <b>actions,</b> such as changes in the price of a product, can affect the neural computations associated with experienced utility. We tested this hypothesis by scanning human subject brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they tasted wines which, contrary to reality, they believed to be different and sold at different prices. Our results show that increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as the neural computations of experienced utility that are made in brain areas such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). The paper provides novel evidence for the ability of <b>marketing</b> <b>actions</b> to modulate neural computations of experienced utility and for the mechanisms through which the effect operates. 3 A basic assumption in economics is that the experienced utility (EU) from consuming...|$|R
