25|$|By {{the time}} I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> where I {{could see them}} it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen {{themselves}} looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that I {{believed}} I had {{the pleasure}} of seeing an old schoolfellow there.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{my little}} camp, which, fortunately, the {{elephants}} had not walked over, and wrapping myself up in a blanket, was soon fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the carriage, and lit my pipe in a glow of emotion.|$|R
6000|$|Oh! I {{have been}} dilatory and dumb; I should have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> you long ago; I should have blabbed nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing but [...] you.|$|R
60|$|Amidst {{these dreams}} came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with her aid I was quickly dressed, and {{stronger}} {{now than in}} the morning, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down <b>to</b> the blue saloon unassisted.|$|R
60|$|Thence I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Robbie's, where I {{rang the}} bell. A servant {{answered}} the summons, {{and told me}} the lawyer was engaged, as I had half expected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I right? Yes; {{this is the}} East room. My dear Miss Price, I {{beg your}} pardon, but I have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> you on purpose to entreat your help." ...|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} from my face, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, I {{leaned against the}} railing to review the situation.|$|E
60|$|Then, with Michelot and Abdon {{following}} {{a short distance}} behind me, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the troopers, and, feigning to stumble as I approached, I hurtled so violently against two of them that I knocked the pair headlong into the stream.|$|R
60|$|My dinner-hour {{being close}} at hand, I had no leisure {{to pursue the}} goggles or the subject then, but <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the Dolphin's Head. In the gateway I found J. Mellows, looking at nothing, and {{apparently}} experiencing that it failed to raise his spirits.|$|R
60|$|This man annoyed me; but as I did not, of course, wish {{to frighten}} horses, I left {{the road and}} <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the tent over some very rough fields. It was a poor day for birds, and I {{did not get a}} shot.|$|R
6000|$|It was now my turn. With {{a beating}} heart I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the robber chieftain, and sank at his feet. [...] "O sir, I am {{nothing but a}} poor governess, pray let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the West End, and {{was trying}} to decide at which of the tall houses to apply first, when the door of one opened, and a pretty housemaid appeared, broom in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{what other}} purpose am I here?' he answered, closing the door, and {{standing}} with his back against it. 'With what object have I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> this place, through difficulty and danger, but to preserve you?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{agreed with}} the old man, and {{dismissed}} him. So {{soon as he was}} gone, I quitted my chamber, and all dust staineded as I was I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down <b>to</b> the garden. A turn in one of the boxwood-bordered alleys brought me suddenly face to face with Madonna Paola.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through <b>to</b> {{ask you if}} you can {{despatch}} a {{force to}} their rescue. Were the tribesmen attacked in their rear, now, they might be scattered easily enough; but they are assembling very fast and, in the morning, it will be a difficult matter to reach them." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> {{the other}} room, almost knocked {{down in the}} passage by a man, half-dressed, tearing along with a bundle of wet proofs in his hand. Adèle was {{standing}} by the wrecked window-frame--there were no more windows anywhere in the building--and she turned to me with a little cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "God, sayest thou?" [...] {{rejoined the}} praefect slowly. [...] "Aye! mayhap thou'rt right. 'Twas God then that sent me. Disguised in humble raiment I went forth {{one day and}} <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the desert lands of Galilee." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{slipped out}} of the door, and passing behind a hedge, <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the road. As I did so, Mr. Woodward and Stumpy turned from the highway and walked {{directly}} up the gravel path that led to the house! ...|$|E
6000|$|The mist chilled {{me to the}} bones. I {{turned from}} the river-bank, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> her lodgings hard by. [...] "It must be done!" [...] I said to myself, as I took out my key and opened the house door.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone I sprang to my feet, and passing out of the pantry, <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> after them <b>to</b> the deck. None of the men saw me, and I lost no time in going forward.|$|R
60|$|I {{had another}} disquieting night, {{and by the}} morning I had <b>made</b> up <b>my</b> mind. The sun was glinting on the placid waters of the river when I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down <b>to</b> the bank, to a great ten-oared keel boat that lay on the Bear Grass, with its square sail furled. An awning was {{stretched}} over the deck, and at a walnut table covered with papers sat Monsieur Vigo, smoking his morning pipe.|$|R
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the cafe. It was {{now almost}} deserted. All but {{one or two}} very late diners had gone, and the tables were being {{prepared}} for supper. Louis, however, was still there, {{sitting at the desk}} {{by the side of the}} cashier, and apparently making calculations. He came forward when he saw me enter, and we met by chance just as one of the under-managers of the hotel passed by.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned from}} her without a word, like an angry child, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the {{steps into the}} sea, pulled round my boat into a little haven beside them, and shewed her oars and tackle and tiller; all the toil, and peril, the wild chances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Get out the hose,’ he said, {{and turned}} to the gun again. I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the boiler-room, in a few minutes went up on the deck again, and the {{fighting}} had grown hotter than ever. Several of the men were missing, and I looked around.|$|E
60|$|I walked swiftly up {{the winding}} ascent, {{straight}} across the flagged courtyard {{and entered the}} castle by a side-door. Then, heedless of the surprised looks of the servants, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the library, and knocking softly {{at the door of}} the inner room, entered.|$|E
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> unobserved <b>to</b> the landing, and {{sat down}} on the stairs to compose myself where nobody could see me. In a moment more I felt a hand laid gently on my shoulder, and {{discovered}} good Benjamin looking at me in dismay. Lady Clarinda had considerately spoken to him, and had assisted him in quietly making his retreat from the room, while his host's attention was still absorbed by the music.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Selingman {{who told}} me," [...] he explained. [...] "Selingman, too, was deceived, but Selingman was nearer to him. He {{discovered}} {{the truth and}} he came to me. It was a matter of two hours ago. I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> first <b>to</b> Maxendorf. I remembered my promise. I waited about in the corridors outside his room until I saw an opportunity. Then I slipped in and took him by the throat. Oh, he's alive, but not very much alive to-night!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stepped back}} {{again into the}} night and took the {{shortest}} cut across the park to the house. As I neared the entrance gates I left the path and crept up close to the plantation which bordered the road. My heart gave a jump as I listened. I could hear the low level throbbing of a motor somewhere quite close at hand. The lights had been extinguished, but it was there waiting. I did not hesitate any longer. I kept on the turf {{by the side of}} the avenue and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up <b>to</b> the house.|$|R
60|$|Nothing loath, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the head}} of the column, where Bowman's company had broken ranks and stood in a ring up to their thighs in the grass. In the centre of the ring, {{standing}} on one foot before our angry Colonel, was Saunders.|$|E
60|$|Jumping over forms, and {{creeping}} under tables, I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the}} fire-places; there, kneeling by {{the high}} wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} {{mechanics}} saw him, they rushed towards him, surrounding him with cries and cheers.... The square was growing fuller every moment; the shops had been closed, and from all quarters came swarming artisans and apprentices. I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Checco and whispered to him,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am of {{the belief}} {{that we have made}} what you might call a tunnel {{straight}} through, and within a dozen inches of the surface," [...] he replied. [...] "I had no means of guessing as to the distance, except by taking the flooring of the building as being well on the level, and from that I feel positive I had <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> upward <b>to</b> a point equal in height to the last rung of the ladder. The question that bothers me is, how we can break through the crust of earth without leaving behind token of what has been done?" ...|$|R
60|$|Afterwards I strolled {{about the}} silent village. Even the cabarets were deserted. A private of the Spanish Louisiana Regiment in a dirty uniform slouched behind the palings {{in front of}} the commandant's quarters,--a quaint stone house set against the hill, with dormer windows in its curving roof, with a wide porch held by eight sturdy hewn pillars; here and there the muffled figure of a prowling Indian loitered, or a barefooted negress shuffled along by the fence crooning a folk-song. All the world had obeyed the call of the church bell save these--and Nick. I bethought myself of Nick, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> Monsieur Gratiot's.|$|R
60|$|No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more {{of these}} grazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as {{possible}} at the possessor of such great expectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in general, and for you! I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> exultant <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep.|$|R
