500|$|The {{next morning}} at about 6:00am Virginia, {{accompanied}} by , [...] and , got underway from Sewell's Point to finish off Minnesota {{and the rest of}} the blockaders, but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00am. In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of Minnesota, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered, [...] "Tell <b>Mr.</b> <b>Green</b> not to fire till I give the word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot." ...|$|E

5000|$|The text {{comes from}} two sources: a popular ballad called [...] "The Cruel Mother", and {{passages}} from various mummers plays, the folk plays of the English countryside.

The two ingredients never meet; both are completely self-contained, involved only in themselves. But near the end, in the final tableau, there is a slight acknowledgement of each other's worlds when the presenter of the mummers' play, Father Christmas, completes the story <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Green</b> has been telling, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Green</b> momentarily enters the mummers’ acting area.|$|R

2500|$|Green's {{rapid rise}} to fame and {{idiosyncratic}} voice are credited with creating {{a major shift}} in the young adult fiction market.

Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the Admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent Terra Australis Incognita (or [...] "unknown southern land"). The aims of the expedition were revealed in the press: [...] "To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano , with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Green,</b> the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt. Cook, for the South Seas, {{under the direction of the}} Royal Society, to observe the Transit of Venus next summer, and to make discoveries to the South and West of Cape Horn". The London Gazetteer was more explicit when it reported on 18 August 1768: [...] "The gentlemen, who are to sail in a few days for George’s Land, the new discovered island in the Pacific ocean, with an intention to observe the Transit of Venus, are likewise, we are credibly informed, to attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract, above the latitude 40". Another article reported that “the principal and almost sole national advantage” of the island discovered by Captain Wallace, that is Tahiti, was “its situation for exploring the Terra Incognita of the Southern Hemisphere”, and that, “The Endeavour, a North-Country Cat, is purchased by the Government, and commanded by a Lieutenant of the Navy; she is fitting out at Deptford for the South Sea, thought to be intended for the newly discovered island.” ...|$|E
