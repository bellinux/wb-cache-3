The key F 2 -layer characteristics are the critical frequency (foF 2) and height of the F 2 peak electron density (hmF 2). It is important to state that hmF 2 values are not directly scaled from ionograms as are other ionospheric F 2 -region parameters. As a result of group retardation of the radar wave, a practical approach to infer hmF 2 values is to use empirical formulas that connect hmF 2 to the <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (MUF) <b>factor,</b> M 3000 F 2 parameter, rather than working with the virtual height read from the ionogram (Bradley and Dudeney, 1973).

Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation.

The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well. In contrast with sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), which affect high frequency radio paths near the Equator, the effects of ionospheric storms are more intense in the polar regions.|$|R

50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> {{regularly}} {{drops below}} 10 MHz in darkness {{during the winter}} months, while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 MHz. It depends on the angle of incidence of the waves; it is lowest when the waves are directed straight upwards, and is higher with less acute angles. This means that at longer distances, where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle, the MUF may be much higher. The lowest <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on the absorption in the lower layer of the ionosphere (the D-layer). This absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity (for example in daylight); total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 MHz during daytime.
