5|$|The Board of Transport Commissioners {{issued its}} report on January 18, 1951. It avoided {{assigning}} individual {{responsibility for the}} deaths and urged the CNR to install block signals on the section of line where the accident took place. The Board noted that the CNR already had a policy of installing such signals, though they were expensive and difficult to obtain from the United States, and that the CNR had deemed other sections of the line more dangerous. It also urged additional training, to ensure that <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> transmitted accurately, and safety checks to catch instances where <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> transmitted incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|The SDU on 9M-MRO (the {{aircraft}} {{used for}} Flight370) logged onto the Inmarsat network at midnightMYT. In the 30 minutes prior to take-off, seventeen <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> exchanged between the SDU and the Inmarsat network. An additional three <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> exchanged between take-off {{and the time}} Flight370 disappeared from secondary radar. The final message to use the ACARS protocol was sent at 01:07; ACARS reports expected at 01:37 and 02:07 were not received. At 02:03 and 2:05, messages from the ground station went unanswered, indicating that the link was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03.|$|E
5|$|After Norman's death, Antares {{took over}} as leader and channeled {{messages}} from her. Others later began channeling her, and recordings of her <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> replayed. Antares died in 1999, and {{a board of directors}} assumed leadership of the organization and channeled. In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a gradual spiritual change in humanity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Messages</b> <b>are</b> {{categorized}} as event and general <b>messages.</b> Event <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> time-critical in that accuracy in transmission and receipt timestamp accuracy directly affects clock distribution accuracy. Sync, Delay_Req, Pdelay_Req and Pdelay_resp <b>are</b> event <b>messages.</b> General <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> more conventional protocol data units {{in that the}} data in these <b>messages</b> <b>is</b> of importance to PTP, but their transmission and receipt timestamps are not. Announce, Follow_Up, Delay_Resp, Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up, Management and Signaling <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> members of the general message class.|$|R
30|$|The FG {{contains}} both discrete {{and continuous}} messages. The discrete <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> {{presented in the}} coder. There {{is no need for}} the investigation of their representation, because they are exactly represented by PMF.Several parameterizable continuous <b>messages</b> might <b>be</b> exactly represented using a straightforward parameterization (e.g., Gaussian <b>message).</b> These <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> presented in the AWGN channel model. The rest of the <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> mixed continuous and discrete messages. These mixture <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> continuously valued <b>messages</b> without an obvious way of their representation. The <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> situated in the phase model.|$|R
5000|$|Kennedy's coconut <b>message</b> <b>was</b> not {{the only}} message given to the coastwatchers. A more {{detailed}} <b>message</b> <b>was</b> written by the executive officer of PT-109, Leonard Jay Thom. Thom's <b>message</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "penciled note" [...] written on paper. Kennedy's <b>message</b> <b>was</b> written on a more hidden location in case the native coastwatchers were stopped and searched by the Japanese.|$|R
5|$|Colonel Ezaki {{reported}} the American attack on Papitalai Mission to the Eighth Area Army in Rabaul, promising a night counterattack on the position; but no attack was delivered. The Japanese withdrew, and no further <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> ever received from Colonel Ezaki.|$|E
5|$|Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah to the Qurayza, {{signalling}} {{a united}} invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as {{a guarantee that}} the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. <b>Messages</b> <b>were</b> repeatedly sent {{back and forth between}} the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} shooting, {{the police}} said they had {{received}} a sizeable number of tip-offs alerting them to suspicious photographs, videos, and comments on chat rooms. Finnish media reported that several bomb threats and other threatening <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> circulating among students nationwide in the {{few days after the}} shootings as well.|$|E

30|$|In a priority-based scheme, a <b>message</b> <b>is</b> {{categorized}} {{into one}} of multiple classes depending {{on the degree of}} importance or priority. According to the assigned priorities, the <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> differently scheduled so that more important or higher priority <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> transmitted first rather than less important or lower priority messages [14 – 18]. Along with this context, a warning <b>message</b> <b>is</b> classified as the highest priority <b>message,</b> to <b>be</b> transmitted earlier than any other messages.|$|R
30|$|CMC_Receive (Algorithm 3) is invoked when a <b>message</b> MSG <b>is</b> received. The {{fields of}} the <b>message</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} to local variables (line 2) {{and the type of}} the <b>message</b> <b>is</b> checked (line 3). Assume the <b>message</b> <b>is</b> of type ALARM: the executing node checks if the alarm is related to itself (line 4).|$|R
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors of}} the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> solved in a similar way.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, RSA {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} encrypt the secret message and advanced LSB technique is used to hide the encrypted message. Firstly, the <b>message</b> <b>is</b> encrypted and then encrypted <b>message</b> <b>is</b> being divided in two parts. First part of the encrypted <b>message</b> <b>is</b> xored with odd position and second part with even position of LSB+ 1. After that the xored encrypted <b>message</b> <b>is</b> being hidden on LSB position...|$|R
50|$|Every NETCONF <b>message</b> <b>is</b> a well-formed XML document. An RPC {{result is}} linked to an RPC {{invocation}} by a message-id attribute. NETCONF <b>messages</b> can <b>be</b> pipelined, i.e., a client can invoke multiple RPCs without having to wait for RPC result messages first. RPC <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> defined in RFC 6241 and notification <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> defined in RFC 5277.|$|R
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These <b>messages</b> <b>were,</b> contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Messages</b> <b>were</b> {{also sent}} from the US. Rudloff, an agent {{based in the}} New York, sent four reports between 2 and 20 June. He {{identified}} the six divisions under Fredendall being sidelined for specialist training in bridge building but not amphibious assault and under heavy security. A last-minute deception involved an MI6 transmitter in France. Known to be under German control, when the operator asked about routes to send escaped prisoners of war the handlers replied that they should, from 15 June, be sent toward Bordeaux.|$|E

50|$|Since verbose textual <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> {{stressing}} bandwidth {{limits for}} debug, so-called catalog <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> provided. Catalog <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> compact binary <b>messages</b> that replace strings with numeric values. The translation from this {{value to the}} verbose <b>message</b> <b>is</b> done by the trace receiving analysis tool {{with the help of}} XML collateral information. This information is provided by the software build process using an XML schema {{that is part of the}} specification as well.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{were less}} enthused about the game's user interface, {{and found that}} many {{gameplay}} details went unexplained. IGN's Jose Otero found the inventory management system, which lacks {{an easy way to}} sort items, to be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E
5|$|The family {{received}} tributes from King GeorgeV, who {{acknowledged the}} debt the country owed to Markham's life work {{of study and}} research; from the Royal Geographical Society and the other learned bodies with which Markham had been associated; from the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Devonport; and from Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian Arctic explorer. Other <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> received from France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and from Arequipa in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Using radio {{messages}} Manekshaw {{addressed the}} Pakistani troops three {{times on the}} subject of surrender, assuring them that they would receive honourable treatment from the Indian troops. They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> delivered as replies to the messages from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. These messages from the Pakistani commanders to their troops were to have a devastating effect on their side, subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E

5|$|Zeppelin was put across {{through various}} means. Double agents relayed {{messages}} about troop movements, dummy formations and radio traffic were created and searches were conducted for local guides and maps, {{as would be}} made {{in preparation for a}} real invasion. Nearly 600 <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> sent through agents, who were used extensively and at considerable risk of exposure. Dummy formations were created in Italy and Libya, Colonel Victor Jones began depicting both an Armoured and Airborne divisions near Tobruk for the first stage of the operation.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of {{consolidation}} on Dominica, Cochrane and Beckwith sailed for Guadeloupe on 27 January 1810, arriving off Le Gosier in the evening and landing the larger division at the village of Sainte-Marie under the command of Hislop. The division split, with one half marching south towards Basse-Terre and the other north. Neither met serious opposition, the militia forces deserting in large numbers and abandoning their fortifications as the British approached. <b>Messages</b> <b>were</b> sent by the approaching British ordering the surrender of towns and forts, and both forces made rapid progress over the following two days. On 30 January, Ernouf took up a position with his remaining garrison in the Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge highlands that guarded the approaches to Basse-Terre, Hislop forming his men in front of Ernouf's position. Later in the day, Harcourt's men came ashore to the north of Basse-Terre, outflanking the strongest French positions at Trois-Rivières and forcing their withdrawal to Basse-Terre itself.|$|E
5|$|Alternate reality {{games were}} used to promote {{the release of the}} games in the main trilogy. The Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email <b>messages,</b> <b>were</b> {{circulated}} by Bungie prior to Halo: Combat Evolveds release. I Love Bees was used to promote the release of Halo2. The game revolved around a website created by 42 Entertainment, commissioned by Microsoft and endorsed by Bungie. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that eventually formed a complete five-hour story set on Earth between Halo and Halo2. Similarly, Iris was used as a viral marketing campaign for the release of Halo3. It featured five web servers containing various media files related to the Halo universe.|$|E
