25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the <b>maximum</b> <b>RAM</b> size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E

50|$|QEMM {{increases}} the available free conventional RAM for MS-DOS 7.10 {{and also for}} DOS Prompt under Windows 95 OSR2/Windows 98 SE. However, QEMM <b>maximum</b> <b>RAM</b> is a shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS, which is less than what DOS 7.10 and Windows 95/98 support without QEMM. MS-DOS 7.10 provides 624K free conventional memory and up to 1GB XMS/32MB EMS; assuming unaltered MS-DOS, using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE without any 3rd party utilities. Thus, QEMM is compatible with MS-DOS 7.10 and Windows 9x and provides slightly more free conventional RAM but it does lower the <b>maximum</b> <b>RAM</b> to 256MB XMS/256MB EMS.|$|E

50|$|The 320 and 540 used a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) memory system. This {{shared the}} video and system memory and ran {{them at the same}} speed, and allowed for up to 80 percent of the system ram to be applied to video memory. The {{allocation}} was static, however, and was adjusted via a profile. The 320 and 540 also used the onboard Cobalt video adapter, which was SGI's proprietary graphics chipset. The firmware the systems used was a PROM that enabled booting into a graphical subsystem before the OS was loaded. In this regard they resembled the Irix/MIPS line of SGI computers such as the SGI O2. The 320 and 540 also stood out for having Firewire (IEEE 1394) ports, onboard composite/s-video capture, and USB keyboards and mice. They differed from each other in the 320 was dual Pentium II/III capable with 1GB <b>maximum</b> system <b>RAM,</b> while the 540 was quad Pentium III Xeon capable with 2GB <b>maximum</b> system <b>RAM.</b> Both computers used a proprietary DIMM module that was essentially the same as ECC SDRAM PC-100, but in a package one half normal size. The maximum memory per module was 96MB, and the SGI 320 had twelve memory slots. It {{is important to note that}} the Firewire ports that were built into the 320 never functioned. SGI distributed Orange Micro Firewire cards about a year after production started in lieu of fixing the Firewire ports.|$|R
50|$|The 440BX had two {{closely related}} chipset peers; the 440ZX and 440MX. 440MX is a mobile chipset for laptops, {{although}} {{a number of}} notebooks did use 440BX. 440ZX is a cost-reduced version of 440BX. It has a lower <b>maximum</b> <b>RAM</b> limit resulting from having support for only 2 RAM banks. The 440ZX-66, designed for Intel Celeron processor, is limited to 66 MHz FSB speed.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{its roots}} as a Lisa — unlike all other Macintosh {{computers}} — the stock Macintosh XL used rectangular pixels. The {{resolution of the}} Macintosh XL's 12 inch (30.5 cm) display was 720x364. Square pixels were available via the Macintosh XL Screen Kit upgrade that changed the resolution to 608x432. The CPU could be replaced with a new CPU board containing up to 8 MB RAM, called the XLerator 18. The <b>maximum</b> upgraded <b>RAM</b> with conventional add-in RAM cards was up to 2 MB - four {{times larger than the}} maximum capacity of earlier Macintosh computers.

50|$|When {{the product}} finally shipped {{after years of}} hype, users were dismayed to find that to install it {{required}} a machine with 2.5 MB of RAM minimum, and really needed 4 MB to run well. This was the <b>maximum</b> available <b>RAM</b> in many Mac systems of the era. Removing unneeded components did little to address this, and AOCE and the other Apple technology du jour, QuickDraw GX, typically could not be run together {{because of a lack}} of memory. While newer machines were able to run AOCE more comfortably, as an e-mail system intended to be run on diverse networks of non-homogeneous machines the requirements greatly impaired market acceptance. Simply downloading and installing separate stand-alone client applications for each mail system the user actually had would use considerably less disk space, and had no constant memory footprint.|$|R
5000|$|By {{selecting}} Custom, {{the user}} can gain further {{control of the}} configuration. For example, by selecting 8-8 kB as the FFT size, the program stresses primarily the CPU. By selecting 2048-4096 kB and unchecking the [...] "Run FFTs in-place" [...] checkbox, providing the <b>maximum</b> amount of <b>RAM</b> free in the system, the program tests the memory and the chipset. If the amount of memory to use option is set too high, then the system will start using the paging file and the test will not stress the memory.|$|R
