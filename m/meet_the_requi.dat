40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{an approach to}} (in) consistency management in viewpoint specification using formal description techniques. Our development model consists of two phases. In the first phase ("inconsistency management"), viewpoints are developed independently, and inconsistency is detected and reported back to the viewpoint specifiers by a central inconsistency manager. Once the inconsistency manager detects that all viewpoints are consistent, {{the second phase of}} "consistency propagation" is entered. In this phase, consistent viewpoint specifications are combined (unified) and developed further in order to obtain an implementation. The consistency management and propagation techniques used in these two phases need to be syntactic in nature and structure preserving. This allows traceability of inconsistencies through precise localisation, and guarantees the possibility of propagation of consistency through compositionality.

40|$|The main aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to investigate how knowledge-based techniques {{could be used for}} developing embedded software in large systems We identify and discuss the various constraints that characterize such systems and their implication on knowledge-based software development. We particularly examine the role of the programming tools in meeting these constraints. A programming language integrating abstract data types and the production rule paradigm, together with a supporting programming environment, is presented as today's realistic approach for introducing knowledge-based software techniques in large embedded systems. The findings are substantiated both by research work in the area and practical experience gained in knowledge-based software development for a digital switch, which is a typical example of a large embedded system.

The proposed method is applied in modeling a non-stationary chemical process. 1 Introduction Continuous adaptation in changing environment {{is one of the most}} fundamental properties of intelligent systems. The ability is needed in autonomous adaptive systems, such as autonomous robots, as well as in control or modeling of any non-stationary processes. Solving the problem, however, requires a solution to two difficult subproblems, incremental learning and handling of the non-stationarity of the environment. The first subproblem is also called on-line learning and stability/plasticity dilemma, where the term stability refers to <b>the</b> <b>requi</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the requirements and potentials for link-sharing mechanisms in packet networks and presents algorithms for hierarchical link-sharing. If multiple agencies, protocol families, or traffic types are {{to share the}} bandwidth on a link in a controlled fashion, the gateways need to provide some set of mechanisms for link-sharing. Link-sharing and realtime services are both emerging services that require resource management mechanisms at the gateway. Rather than requiring a gateway to implement separate mechanisms for linksharing and for realtime services, the approach in {{this paper is to}} view link-sharing requirements and requirements for realtime services as simultaneous and in some respect complementary constraints at the gateway that can be implemented with a unified set of mechanisms. The relationship between link-sharing requirements and real-time requirements at the gateway is discussed in this paper in some detail.

40|$|Efforts are now {{underway}} {{to develop a}} new generation of routing protocol that will allow each Administrative Domain (AD) in the growing Internet (and internets in general) to independently express and enforce policies regarding the flow of packets to, from, and through its resources. 1 This document articulates the requirements for policy based routing and should be used as input to the functional specification and evaluation of proposed protocols. Two critical assumptions will shape the type of routing mechanism that is devised: (1) the topological organization of ADs, and (2) the type and variability of policies expressed by ADs. After justifying our assumptions regarding AD topology we present a taxonomy, and specific examples, of policies that must be supported by a PR protocol. We conclude with a brief discussion of policy routing mechanisms proposed in previous RFCs (827, 1102, 1104, 1105). Future RFCs will elaborate on the architecture and protocols needed to support <b>the</b> <b>requi</b> [...] ...|$|R

The author is writ ing about the subject from general point of view as wel l as focusing on the tax system in the Czech Republic as in 2008 whi le indicat ing the possible future development {{in terms of the}} EC tax harmonization process and existing double taxation t reaties. The first part explains the general characteristics of the tax system. It defines some related key terms: tax, tax system, subject and object of the tax immunity, tax base, tarrif rate, period of taxation and the main functions of taxation: allocation, redest ribution, stabilization and the fiscal function. Author also mentions some of <b>the</b> <b>requi</b> red characteristics of the tax system - fairness, effectiveness, stimulation, legal perfection and transparency and some of the possible tax divisions, the most commonly used division between assessed and excise taxes in particular. The author describes the process of the tax harmonization within the EC.
