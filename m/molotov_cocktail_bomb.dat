50|$|On 24 March 1976 Isabel Perón {{was ousted}} and a {{military}} junta installed, led by General Jorge Rafael Videla. On 4 April 1976, Montoneros assassinated a naval commander (Jose Guillermo Burgos) and a Chrysler executive (Jorge Ricardo Kenny) and ambushed and killed three policemen in a patrol car. On 26 April 1976, Montoneros guerrillas killed Colonel Abel Héctor Elías Cavagnaro outside his home in Tucumán province. On 27 June 1976, Montoneros guerrillas operating {{in the city of}} Rosario ambush and destroy two police cars, killing three policemen During {{the first few months of}} the military government, more than 70 policemen were killed in leftist guerrilla attacks. On 11 August 1976, urban guerrillas dressed like policemen intercept and kill army corporal Jorge Antonio Bulacio, with two shots to the head and set fire to his military lorry belonging to the 141st Headquarters Communications Battalion with a <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
50|$|The car {{may also}} be {{equipped}} with an additional battery; dual foot-pedal controls, such as those used by driving instruction companies (in case the driver is wounded or incapacitated), a PA system with a microphone and a megaphone mounted {{on the outside of}} the car, so that the driver can give commands to other convoy vehicles or bodyguards who are on foot; fire extinguishers inside the vehicle in case the vehicle is struck by a <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> <b>bomb</b> or other weapon; a reinforced front and rear bumper, to enable the driver to ram attacking vehicles; and additional mirrors, to give the driver a better field of view. In Latin American countries many armored cars will come with a siren and lights to use in situations were they need to get out of places quickly. Decoy convoys and vehicles are used to prevent tailing. In the event the convoy holding the client is compromised and ambushed, decoy convoys can also act as a reinforcement force that can ambush a force that is attacking the primary convoy. Some clients rotate between residences in different cities when attending public events or meetings to prevent being tailed home or to a private location.|$|E
50|$|The Old Chemistry Building, now {{designated}} as Brevard Hall, {{was built in}} 1923.

50|$|Murphy learns {{how to fly}} the {{aircraft}} in the most daring way, getting {{it out on the}} choppy waters of the river and discovering how the controls work by trial and error. Murphy soon finds the U-boat's hiding place and attempts to bomb it using home-made <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> <b>bombs,</b> which fails. Meanwhile, word has come that Germany has surrendered, but Murphy is obsessed with revenge and makes plans to ram the U-boat with a floating crane owned by the friendly Frenchman Louis (Philippe Noiret). This also fails as the U-boat dives under him. However, the submerged U-boat becomes stuck in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier from the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed, as the explosion from the torpedo causes the crane jib to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed.|$|R

50|$|The {{sixth floor}} of Bursley Hall {{was the site}} of a double-shooting that {{occurred}} on April 17, 1981. The morning of April 17, 22-year-old Leo Kelly Jr., a junior Psychology major at the University, threw several <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> fire <b>bombs</b> down the sixth-floor hallway of Bursley's Douglas wing, igniting fires and triggering the building's fire alarms.

As students evacuated the building, Kelly retrieved a sawed-off shotgun from his room and then fired between two and five rounds at fleeing students. 19-year-old University freshman Edward Siwik, who was the fire marshal for his floor and was attempting to wake fellow students, and 21-year-old senior Douglas McGreaham, a fifth floor Resident Advisor attempting to assist with the evacuation, were shot in the chest and back, respectively, each dying from his wounds.|$|R
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, {{they met with}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men {{targeting}} Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten by a garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebel planes tried air attacks on the capital. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was. The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> for <b>bombs,</b> in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|R
5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, <b>molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> and pipe <b>bombs,</b> among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a <b>molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the week, {{the arrest}} of Hamas leaders went quietly as they acceded to their detention, but by Friday, 20 June, {{sporadic}} popular resistance began to emerge. Three Palestinians were wounded in a raid on Qalandiya refugee camp, near Jerusalem, while another five were wounded in clashes at the Dheisheh refugee camp by Bethlehem, whose Ibdaa cultural center was wrecked, cheques and money from its safe, together with five computers, confiscated. Four {{of the victims were}} reportedly run over by an Israeli jeep. Also on 20 June, Israeli soldiers near the Qalandiya checkpoint in Ramallah fired live rounds at a group of Palestinians who had thrown homemade grenades at them. Mustafa Hosni Aslan, 22, received a gunshot wound to the head, and died on 25 June. Live fire was used according to the IDF in response to <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails,</b> pipe <b>bombs,</b> one makeshift grenade, firecrackers, and stones being thrown at soldiers at the camps. In Dura's Haninia neighbourhood, after a night-long raid, involving many clashes with local youths, to detain a person Israelis consider to be a terrorist, as troops were withdrawing, eyewitness testimonies reported that a retreating Israeli soldier fired six shots and killed 15-year-old Mohammed Dudeen. Twenty-five more Palestinians were arrested at Dura and Dheisheh, bringing the number of detainees to 320, of which 240 are considered Hamas operatives. The number of sites searched mounted to 1,150, of which 1,000 buildings were damaged, the figure including over 750 homes. According to Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki Israel had destroyed 150 homes by week's end. In another dawn raid on the Dean's Office and Student Union of the Arab American University in Jenin papers were seized, and Amir Saadi, 17, was shot in the shoulder. The villages of Arraba, Al-Louz, and Artas were also raided.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{reports on}} <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktail</b> {{cases in the}} local media has warrant {{a need for a}} {{detailed}} investigation of the perpetrator of the crime. A study is therefore embarked to compare fingerprint quality recovered from glass fragments of <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails.</b> The accelerants used were petrol, kerosene, diesel and motor oil. Different types of accelerant were used to observe the effect of accelerant on the quality of fingerprint recovered from glass fragment of <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails.</b> In the study, <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> were exploded and glass fragments bearing fingerprint marks were collected and transported back to laboratory for analysis. Prior to fingerprint analysis, soot were removed from glass fragment using three techniques of brushing, NaOH (2 %) wash solution and tape lifting. After soot removal, enhancement fingerprint were done by using methods such as dusting method, superglue fuming method and Small Particle Reagent (SPR) method. Then, fingerprints from glass fragment of <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> were identified by manual matching. Powder dusting method was used for sample petrol only because most of glass fragment were obtained in dry condition. Other than that, superglue fuming method was used in majority of sample whether <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> were allowed to burn out naturally or the fire was extinguished using water. Small particle reagent method was mostly used for the wet glass fragment. Fingerprints recovered were photographed and were sent for manual matching. Based on the enhancement fingerprint method used, most of the latent fingerprint was developed with various qualities. Based on the percent recovery, SPR method shows the best recovery (43. 75 %) at the scale 3 fingerprint, followed by superglue fuming and dusting powder. In manual matching method, percentage success rate in the case where fire of <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> was allowed to burn out naturally was 55. 56 % while in the case of fire extinguished using water, percentage success rate was 33. 33 %. This study also showed that manual matching method of fingerprints recovered from <b>Molotov</b> <b>cocktails</b> with fingerprint obtained from suspect or standard can be done...|$|R
