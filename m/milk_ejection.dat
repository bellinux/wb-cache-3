25|$|Its uterine-contracting {{properties}} {{were discovered}} by British pharmacologist Sir Henry Hallett Dale in 1906. And its <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> property {{was described by}} Ott and Scott in 1910 and by Schafer and Mackenzie in 1911.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex/Letdown reflex: In {{lactating}} (breastfeeding) mothers, oxytocin acts at the mammary glands, causing milk to be 'let down' into subareolar sinuses, {{from where}} it can be excreted via the nipple. Suckling by the infant at the nipple is relayed by spinal nerves to the hypothalamus. The stimulation causes neurons that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pregnancy}} on lactation was studied {{during the third}} week of lactational pregnancy in postpartum pregnant rats with a delay in implantation of only 1 day (1 d-LP rats). In an experimental design in which the suckling litter was prevented from consuming solid food, lactational performance was estimated by weighing the ten-pup suckling litters on days 16 - 21 of lactation or by measuring maternal weight loss after a nursing spell on day 21. In 1 d-LP rats, food consumption as well as lactational performance was lower than it was in nonpregnant lactating rats (L rats) and pregnant-lactating rats with a normal long delay of implantation of at least 6 days (LP rats). The time spent by the pups sucking at the nipples was not different among the three groups, but the number of <b>milk</b> <b>ejections</b> was diminished in 1 d-LP dams. Restriction of daily food supply during days 16 to 21 of lactation diminished lactational performance more strongly in 1 d-LP rats than it did in L rats; 1 d-LP rats conserved protein stores and mobilized fewer minerals than did L rats. The weight and composition of the litter in utero were not affected by the food restriction. Ln pregnant-lactating rats (LP and 1 d-LP rats), the number of early resorptions was increased in comparison with pregnant rats, showing that lactation can affect the earlier stages of pregnancy. It was concluded that late pregnancy does not affect nursing behaviour, but suppresses lactation by restricting maternal food intake and mobilization of maternal stores. Measurements in serum indicate a causative role for oestradiol, but not for leptin...|$|R
40|$|In female rats, the {{capacity}} for nitric oxide (NO) production within the hypothalamus is regulated by reproductive state and by the ovarian and peptidergic hormonal pattern that simulates late pregnancy. The first series of experiments described in this thesis examined the interaction of prolactin and oxytocin in upregulating nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and oxytocin gene expression within the hypothalamus in steroid-primed rats. Prolactin was found to upregulate NOS and this effect was mediated by oxytocin receptor activation. In addition, increased prolactin was associated {{with an increase in}} oxytocin mRNA within both the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. The second set of experiments explored the inhibitory role of NO within the hypothalamic neurohypophysial system. The results demonstrated that NO modulated the activity of neurons in discrete nuclei in the hypothalamus and that this modulation was stimulus specific and varied with reproductive state. Central oxytocin administration induced more Fos expression within the SON and PVN in lactating than in nonlactating rat; but the opposite effect was seen following urethane administration. Inhibiting NO production increased Fos induction following central oxytocin administration in lactating rats whereas in nonlactating rats NOS inhibition decreased Fos-lir following both types of stimulation. The third series of experiments investigated a role for NO in <b>milk</b> <b>ejections</b> and the regulation of established maternal behavior. Data from these studies revealed that central inhibition of NO production disrupted pup retrieval and maternal aggression on both Day 4 and Day 10 of lactation. Together the experiments described in this thesis show that prolactin and oxytocin interact to upregulate NOS within the PVN and SON. Moreover, the increase in capacity to produce NO during lactation has a restraining effect on the activation of oxytocin neurons by oxytocin. Finally, NO has also been shown {{to play an important role}} in maternal retrieval and aggression...|$|R

25|$|Mechanically, {{a breast}} pump is {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the breast pump suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The breast pump is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E
25|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography {{data show that}} with KCNE2, 124I uptake by the thyroid is impaired. Kcne2 deletion does not impair organification of iodide once it has been taken up by NIS. Pups raised by Kcne2-/- dams are particularly severely affected because rhey receive less milk (hypothyroidism of the dams impairs <b>milk</b> <b>ejection),</b> the milk they receive is deficient in T4, and they themselves cannot adequately transport iodide into the thyroid. Kcne2-/- pups exhibit stunted growth, alopecia, cardiomegaly and reduced cardiac ejection fraction, {{all of which are}} alleviated by thyroid hormone supplementation of pups or dams. Surrogating Kcne2-/- pups with Kcne2+/+ dams also alleviates these phenotypes, highlighting the influence of maternal genotype in this case.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of increased growth of small piglets following split weaning were studied using {{a total of}} 10 sows and 100 piglets. Sows and their litters were allocated to a treatment group (piglets split-weaned) or control group (no piglets split-weaned). At day 22 of lactation, piglets in each litter were classified as either 'heavy' or 'light', with equal numbers in each group. 'Heavy' piglets were removed from sows at day 22 (s. e. m. 0. 17) in split-weaned litters while 'light' piglets remained with their mothers for an extra week. At 29. 5 (s. e. m. 0. 21) days of age, sows from both split-weaned and control litters were weaned. Milk consumption was estimated between days 16 and 19 and on day 24 of lactation by weighing piglets before and after sucking. During milk letdown, the teats that piglets sucked from were noted. A video recorder {{was used to determine}} the frequency of natural sucklings, the proportion of unsuccessful sucklings, and the time taken for piglets to consume <b>milk</b> during <b>ejection,</b> over a 16 -h period before and after split weaning. 'Light' piglets in split-weaned litters grew 61 % faster (P < 0. 001) than their counterparts in control litters and were 15 % heavier (P < 0. 01) at weaning. This was explained by a 49 % increase in milk intake (64 v. 43 g/sucking, P 5 0. 001). Increased milk intake was due to multiple teat swapping with an associated longer duration of sucking during letdown. 'Heavy' piglets weaned at 22 days were lighter at 29 days than their counterparts in control litters (P < 0. 01). Gains in growth made by 'light' piglets in split-weaned sows over their counterparts in control litters had disappeared by the time pigs were 9 weeks old, and piglets classed as 'heavy' at day 22 of lactation remained heavier (P < 0. 001) at 62 days of age irrespective of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Maternal adaptations during {{lactation}} include <b>milk</b> synthesis and <b>ejection,</b> {{the appearance}} of maternal behaviours, reduced stress response, suppression of the ovarian cycle, and increased food and fluid intake. Several recently identified neuropeptides may participate in these adaptations, and we focus on {{two of them in}} the present study: tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP 39) and amylin. TIP 39 is the ligand of the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH 2 receptor) is induced in the posterior intralaminar complex of the thalamus (PIL) during lactation. TIP 39 neurones in the PIL are activated in mother rats in response to pup exposure and project to preoptic, periventricular, paraventricular, arcuate and dorsomedial regions of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, an antagonist of the PTH 2 receptor reduced suckling induced prolactin release. On the basis of their projections, TIP 39 neurones might interact with additional neurones involved in maternal adaptations, including kisspeptin neurones participating in the control of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone function. TIP 39 fibres might also interact with amylin, a peptide that we recently identified to appear in the preoptic area of rat dams. On the basis of its distribution, preoptic amylin could {{play a role in the}} control of maternal behaviours. We hypothesise that TIP 39 neurones mediate the effects of suckling on different hypothalamic systems to affect maternal adaptations...|$|R

50|$|A poor <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex can {{be due to}} sore or cracked nipples, {{separation}} from the infant, a history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma. If a mother has trouble breastfeeding, different methods of assisting the <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex may help. These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower.|$|E
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>ejection</b> is {{initiated}} in the mother's breast by {{the act of}} suckling by the baby. The <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Once a woman is conditioned to nursing, let-down can be triggered {{by a variety of}} stimuli, including the sound of any baby. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. However, this and other problems often settle after two weeks of feeding. Stress or anxiety can cause difficulties with breastfeeding. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> or let-down reflex. Oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Some feel a slight tingling, others feel immense amounts of pressure or slight pain/discomfort, and still others do not feel anything different.|$|E
5000|$|Oxytocin stimulates {{powerful}} uterine contractions, which trigger {{labor and}} delivery of an infant, and <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> in nursing women. Its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{documented}} {{reference to}} a hormonally based negative emotional reaction while breastfeeding was found online in a forum in June 2004. Prior to the launch of D-MER.org the phenomenon was unknown, unnamed, misunderstood and rarely mentioned or talked about. The term dysphoric <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex (D-MER) came from Alia Macrina Heise {{who was the first}} to identify and describe the phenomenon to lactation professionals in 2007. It was chosen due to the emotional reaction (dysphoria) to milk let-down (<b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> reflex). The [...] "milk ejection reflex" [...] is abbreviated among lactation professionals and referred to as the M-E-R. This means that D-MER is not said DEE-MERE, but rather D.M.E.R, all the letters names said individually. In 2008 a team of lactation consultants, headed up by Diane Wiessinger, MS, IBCLC, LLLL worked together and consulted with other medical professionals to do a preliminary investigation to better understand D-MER. After the first published case study of D-MER, it became a more widely known and accepted condition.|$|E
5000|$|When an SNS is used, it {{is still}} feeding breastmilk, the device ideally helps coming back to {{exclusive}} breastfeeding.

5000|$|The {{phase of}} {{competition}} for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute, and ends when milk flow begins. In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats {{in their mouths}} and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), {{and the rate of}} the sow’s grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds. The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream. [...] Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10-20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second. The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase. Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow. The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder. Piglets massage and suckle the sow’s teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status. This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings. The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Milk</b> <b>ejection</b> is a {{transient}} episode critical to milk removal and women typically have multiple milk ejections during breastfeeding and pumping. Recently {{it was found}} that <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> characteristics such as number of milk ejections and periodicity were consistent throughout 12 months of lactation in women who expressed their milk with an electric breast pump. It is not known whether the stimulation of an infant at the breast influences <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> patterns or whether this is a programmed event. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> patterns during breastfeeding and expressing milk with an electric pump within mothers. Methods: Twelve lactating mothers with normal milk production (502 – 1356 mL) had <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> recorded by measuring the diameter of a major milk duct with ultrasound imaging throughout an entire breastfeed and a 15 -min pumping session. Scans were analysed for timing, duration of duct dilation and maximum duct diameter. Results: The initial <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> defined as the first increase in duct diameter was observed earlier during breastfeeding than during two phase pumping sessions but was not statistically significant (p =. 057). There were no significant differences between the duration of the first or second <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> for mothers when breastfeeding or pumping at their maximum comfortable vacuum (p =. 18; p =. 99). The times taken to reach the peak duct diameter, or the first half of the <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> were also not found to be significantly different between breastfeeding and pumping.

In addition, 270 dairy farms that had reported cases of animals with poor milkability were contacted for an interview to classify the disorders.

40|$|Under stress, {{nursing is}} either {{unsatisfactory}} or impossible. It {{has been shown}} that stress inhibits release of oxytocin from the neuro-hypophysis (Cross, 1955 b; Fitzpatrick, 1961). Oxytocin in addition to its well-known uterine stimulating activity also has a specific action on the lactating mammary gland. It stimulates the myoepithelial cells in the mammary gland (Lin-zell, 1955). Contraction of these cells causes <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> or milk let-down from the lactating gland. In the absence of oxytocin <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> cannot take place and the suckling young are unable to remove milk from the mammary gland. This appears to be true in all mammals (Whittle-stone et at., 1952) including lactating women (Newton and Newton, 1948). The inability to nurse under stress may also be due to inhibition of <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> by the activation of the sympathoadrenal system. Cross (1955 a) showed that electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves supplying the mammary gland or the adrenal gland inhibited the milk ejecting response to oxytocin in the rabbit. Intravenous injection of epinephrine or norepi-nephrine also produced the same inhibitory ef-fect. Pickford (1960) also reported the inhibi-tion by epinephrine of <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> in the dog. The mechanism of inhibition of <b>milk</b> <b>ejection</b> by these sympathetic amines has not been fully elucidated. The limited available information (Cross, 1955 a; Linzell, 1955; Kullander, 1963) suggests that the inhibitory activity of epineph-rime and norepinephrine results from their vaso-constrictor property preventing oxytocin from reaching the mammary myoepithelial cells to provoke <b>milk</b> <b>ejection.</b> In this paper, we de-scribe experimental data in which we attempted to find out whether the inhibitory activity of epinephrine is, indeed, secondary to its vaso-constrictor property.
