50|$|Tsien is {{also the}} first to show that {{defective}} Alzheimer's genes (e.g. presenilin-1) impaired adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, revealing the role of adult neurogenesis in <b>memory</b> <b>clearance,.</b>|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{bacterial}} clearance were investigated in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea). Primary clearance kinetics were determined for three bacteria, a marine Gram negative motile rod, a marine Gram positive non-motile rod, and a Gram negative freshwater fish pathogen, Aeromonas salmonicida. Clearance kinetics differed {{for each of}} the three bacteria. Secondary clearance rates were not significantly different from primary clearance rates for any of the three bacteria, regardless of the time interval between inoculations (9 - 21 days), implying a probable absence of immunologic <b>memory.</b> During primary <b>clearance,</b> total coelomocyte counts declined 93 % by 90 min post injection. All four coelomocyte types declined, however the relative proportions of each type changed during the six-hour sampling period. In cell-free coelomic fluid, viable counts of marine bacteria declined, with different kinetics for the two species. Viable counts in sea water controls did not change. Declines in viable counts may be due to bactericidal activity and/or agglutination, although bacterial agglutination was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{persistence}} of Ag-experienced CD 8 cells, {{a class of}} T lymphocytes with cytotoxic function, contributes to immunological memory against intracellular pathogens. After Ag <b>clearance,</b> <b>memory</b> CD 8 cells are maintained over time by a slow proliferation, primarily cytokine driven. In this article, we show that the bone marrow (BM) is the crucial organ where such basal division of memory CD 8 cells occurs. BM memory CD 8 cells contain {{a higher percentage of}} proliferating cells than their corresponding cells in either spleen or lymph nodes from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. This occurs both in the case of memory-phenotype CD 44 (high) CD 8 cells {{and in the case of}} Ag-specific memory CD 8 cells. Importantly, the absolute number of Ag-specific memory CD 8 cells dividing in the BM largely exceeds that in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and lung taken together. In the BM, Ag-specific memory CD 8 cells express lower levels of CD 127, i. e., the alpha-chain of IL- 7 R, than in either spleen or lymph nodes. We interpret these results as indirect evidence that Ag-specific memory CD 8 cells receive proliferative signals by IL- 7 and/or IL- 15 in the BM and propose that the BM acts as a saturable "niche" for the Ag-independent proliferation of memory CD 8 cells. Taken together, our novel findings indicate that the BM plays a relevant role in the maintenance of cytotoxic T cell memory, in addition to its previously described involvement in long-term Ab responses...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that DNA {{vaccination}} can confer protection against a persistent viral infection by priming CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Adult BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice were injected intramuscularly with a plasmid expressing the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) {{under the control of}} the cytomegalovirus promoter. The LCMV NP contains the immunodominant CTL epitope (amino acids 118 to 126) recognized by mice of the H- 2 d haplotype. After three injections with 200 micrograms of NP DNA, the vaccinated mice were challenged with LCMV variants (clones 13 and 28 b) that establish persistent infection in naive adult mice. Fifty percent of the DNA-vaccinated mice were protected, as evidenced by decreased levels of infectious virus in the blood and tissues, eventual clearance of viral antigen from all organs tested, the presence of an enhanced LCMV-specific CD 8 + CTL response, and maintenance of <b>memory</b> CTL after <b>clearance</b> of virus infection. However, it should be noted that protection was seen in only half of the vaccinated mice, and we were unable to directly measure virus-specific immune responses in any of the DNA-vaccinated mice prior to LCMV challenge. Thus, at least in the system that we have used, gene immunization was a suboptimal method of inducing protective immunity and was several orders of magnitude less efficient than vaccination with live virus. In conclusion, our results show that DNA immunization works against a persistent viral infection but that efforts should be directed towards improving this novel method of vaccination...|$|R
40|$|CD 8 + T {{cells are}} the main {{adaptive}} immune system cell type responding to intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses, and tumor antigens. In the case of influenza, activated T cells migrate from the mediastinal (draining) lymph nodes to the lung where they perform their cytolytic function. After pathogen <b>clearance,</b> <b>memory</b> CD 8 + T cells are generated, giving rise to long-term protection from reinfection. However, these cells are no longer detectable in the lung parenchyma six months post-infection, and cell-mediated immunity, and protection is lost. Knock-out studies in mice show that interleukin 15 (IL- 15) is essential for memory CD 8 + T cell proliferation. Fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells and epithelial cells express IL- 15 and its receptor isoform [alpha] (IL- 15 R[alpha]). Histological studies suggest that memory CD 8 + T cells preferentially reside in peribronchiolar and perivascular areas, the stroma, of the lung. We hypothesize that memory CD 8 + T cells preferentially reside in regions where molecules necessary for their maintenance, for example, IL- 15 /R secreting cells, are located. In this study, we have shown that antigen-specific 2 C GFP effector memory CD 8 + T cells are generated in B 6 recipient mice 30 - 32 days after influenza virus infection, preferentially reside in peribronchiolar areas. Both 2 C and 2 C GFP recipient mice have severe vasculitis and widely distributed inflammatory infiltrates 7 days post-infection. Lower lung lobes {{appear to be more}} affected than upper lobes at this time point. On day 30, most of the airways have been cleared and restored. Although lymphoid-appearing nodules were detected in the lungs 31 dpi, no clusters of B cells and T cells suggesting induced BALT were identified by immunofluorescence. (cont.) Interestingly, antigen-specific GFP cells preferentially remained in the lung tissue and were almost undetectable in spleens, lymph nodes, and livers. This preference was not observed in 2 C (non-GFP) recipient mice. Immunofluorescence studies showed no colocalization between 2 C GFP T cells and dendritic cells that might suggest stable dendritic cell interactions contribute to antigen-specific cells preferentially residing in the lung stroma. Further studies are necessary to determine what other cell types might contribute to this phenomenon. These results provide some insight into how structural elements in non-lymphoid tissue influence cell-mediated immunity. by Mobolaji O. Olurinde. Thesis (S. M.)
