5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once <b>more</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} such successes, Australian heavy metal {{continues}} {{to remain a}} fringe underground culture still widely ignored by the mainstream industry and media. When it was announced in mid-2006 that the annual Metal for the Brain festival would be no <b>more</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> final event on 4 November, no regular news service outside of Canberra carried word of it, {{even though it had}} often attracted up to 3000 people and had been running as long as the Big Day Out. In an interview with Australian metal webzine , festival director Adam Agius suggested the festival would return in 2008; this now seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The {{residential}} {{hamlet of}} Neversink soon is {{left behind by}} NY55 and CR17, continuing northeast through the namesake town. Just northeast of the junction with Myers Road, NY55 and CR17 cross into the Catskill Forest Preserve. Continuing past a junction with Benton Hollow Road, the route soon bends eastward through Neversink, reaching a junction with Wagner Road, where CR17 terminates. NY55 continues eastward alone along Neversink Road, maintained by NYSDOT once <b>more.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> bend to the northeast, the route reaches the hamlet of Curry, where it junctions with CR19, which connects to the Ulster County line via CR157. Passing the Chestnut Creek Covered Bridge nearby, NY55 quickly leaves Curry and bends southeast through the hamlet of Unionville.|$|E

[...] The rates of PCS vary, but most studies report that about 15% of individuals with a history of a single concussion develop persistent symptoms associated with the injury.

60|$|They {{were not}} silent, however, though inactive. At first some indistinct mutterings arose among them, which were {{followed}} by a hiss or two, and these swelled by degrees into a perfect storm. Then one voice said, 'Down with the Papists!' {{and there was a}} pretty general cheer, but nothing <b>more.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> lull of a few moments, one man cried out, 'Stone him;' another, 'Duck him;' another, in a stentorian voice, 'No Popery!'

6000|$|Now {{and then}} Mr. Morris would call {{one of his}} {{visitors}} aside; and after a brief colloquy in an ante-room, he would return alone, and the visitors in question reappeared no <b>more.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> certain number of repetitions, this performance excited Brackenbury's curiosity to a high degree. He determined {{to be at the}} bottom of this minor mystery at once; and strolling into the ante-room, found a deep window recess concealed by curtains of the fashionable green. Here he hurriedly ensconced himself; nor had he to wait long before the sound of steps and voices drew near him from the principal apartment. Peering through the division, he saw Mr. Morris escorting a fat and ruddy personage, with somewhat the look of a commercial traveller, whom Brackenbury had already remarked for his coarse laugh and under-bred behaviour at the table. The pair halted immediately before the window, so that Brackenbury lost not a word of the following discourse:- ...|$|E

60|$|The light shell surged {{forward to}} the sturdy stroke, for several of those behind me were masters of the paddle, and as I plied my blade I felt with a thrill that {{it was good to}} fight the might of the river in such a company. Snowy wreaths boiled high about the {{shearing}} prow, I could hear the others catch their breath with a hiss, and once <b>more</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> heavy thud the cedar floor seemed to raise itself beneath me and leap to the impulse, while, with a hardening of every muscle, I swept the leaf-shaped blade outward ready for the dip. There was spray in my eyes, and bearing down on us through it a boulder, with dim trunks opening and closing beyond; then I saw only the bird's head on the prow, for some one cried behind that my stroke was slow, and by the rush of foam and the shock of thudding blow I knew that the others' blades were whirling like flails.|$|E
6000|$|If we limit {{ourselves}} to the first advantages;--a sober grace adheres to the mineral and botanic kingdoms, which, in the highest moments, comes up as the charm of nature,--the glitter of the spar, the sureness of affinity, the veracity of angles. Light and darkness, heat and cold, hunger and food, sweet and sour, solid, liquid, and gas, circle us round in a wreath of pleasures, and, by their agreeable quarrel, beguile the day of life. The eye repeats every day the finest eulogy on things--"He {{saw that they were}} good." [...] We know where to find them; and these performers are relished all the <b>more,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> little experience of the pretending races. We are entitled, also, to higher advantages. Something is wanting to science, until it has been humanized. The table of logarithms is one thing, and its vital play, in botany, music, optics, and architecture, another.

60|$|They drove on, {{though it}} {{occurred}} to Carroll {{that they were not}} opening up the bay very rapidly. The light was growing, and he could now discern the orderly phalanxes of white-topped combers that crumbled into a chaotic spouting on the point's outer end. It struck him that the sloop would not last long if she touched bottom there; but once <b>more,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> glance at Vane's face, he kept silent. After all, Vane was leader; and when he looked as he did then, he usually resented advice. The mouth of the bay grew wider, until Carroll could see most of the forest-girt shore on one side of it; but the surf upon the point was growing unpleasantly near. Wisps of spray whirled away from it and vanished among the scrubby firs clinging to the fissured crags behind. The sloop, however, was going to windward, for Vane was handling her with nerve and skill. She had almost cleared the point when there was a rattle and a bang inside of her. Carroll started.|$|E

60|$|A {{farmhouse}} such as {{this seems}} to me always a type of the Spanish impenetrability. I have been over many of them, and know the manner of their rooms and the furniture, the round of duties there performed and how the day is portioned out; but the real life of the inhabitants escapes me. My knowledge is merely external. I am conscious {{that it is the}} same of the Andalusians generally, and am dismayed because I know practically nothing <b>more</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> good many years than I learnt in the first months of my acquaintance with them. Below the superficial similarity with the rest of Europe which of late they have acquired, there is a difference which makes it impossible to get at the bottom of their hearts. They have no openness as have the French and the Italians, with whom a good deal of intimacy is possible even to an Englishman, but on the contrary an Eastern reserve which continually baffles me. I cannot realise their thoughts nor their outlook. I feel always below the grace of their behaviour the instinctive, primeval hatred of the stranger.|$|E

I sent a native preacher to visit him. The man said he heard the voice which had conversed with him formerly, but it spoke very differently. Its language was exceedingly pleasant to hear, and produced great brokenness of heart. It said, [...] "Love each other; act righteously--act uprightly," [...] with other exhortations such us he had heard from the teachers. An assistant was placed in the village near him, when the spirit left him again; and ever since he has maintained the character of a consistent Christian.'[2] ...|$|E
60|$|For {{nearly a}} month Frobisher's ship stood {{on and off the}} coast. Fresh water was taken on board. In a {{convenient}} spot the ship was beached and at low tide repairs were made and leaks were stopped in the strained timbers of her hull. In the third week, canoes of savages were seen, and presently the natives were induced to come on board the Gabriel and barter furs for looking-glasses and trinkets. The savages were 'like Tartars with long black hair, broad faces, and flat noses.' They seemed friendly and well-disposed. Five of the English {14} sailors ventured to join the natives on land, contrary to the express orders of the captain. They never returned, nor could any of the savages be afterwards induced to come within reach. One man only, paddling in the sea in his skin canoe, was enticed to the ship's side by the tinkling of a little bell, and so seized and carried away. But his own sailors, though he vainly searched the coast, Frobisher saw no <b>more.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> week's delay, the Gabriel set sail (on August 26) for home, and in spite of terrific gales was safely back at her anchorage at Harwich early in October.|$|E
