(Henry was a contract bridge expert and former husband of Kitty Munson Cooper.) He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1941. Writing to Sommerfeld in 1947, Bethe confided that [...] "I am much more at home in America than I ever was in Germany.

500|$|The Waugh family {{connection}} with Midsomer Norton began when Dr Alexander Waugh, father of Arthur Waugh and grandfather of Evelyn Waugh and Alec Waugh moved to Island House, {{which had been}} built in the early 18th century, in The Island in the centre of the town in 1865. The family later moved to a house in Silver Street. As a boy, Evelyn Waugh spent his summer holidays in Midsomer Norton with his maiden aunts. He later described his visits there: “I suppose that in fact I never spent longer than two months there in any year, but the place captivated my imagination as <b>my</b> <b>true</b> home never did.” ...|$|E
500|$|Fuller's [...] "The Great Lawsuit" [...] {{was written}} in serial form for The Dial. She {{originally}} intended to name the work The Great Lawsuit: Man 'versus' Men, Woman 'versus' Women; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was titled Woman in the Nineteenth Century. After completing it, she wrote to a friend: [...] "I had put {{a good deal of}} <b>my</b> <b>true</b> self in it, as if, I suppose I went away now, the measure of my footprint would be left on earth." [...] The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller's opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American feminism. It is considered {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{landscape}} {{paintings of}} Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (18191891) influenced both Boudin and Monet {{and contributed to}} the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment <b>my</b> <b>true</b> master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Harisu {{made the}} {{decision}} to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now I am on my own, and showing <b>my</b> <b>true</b> colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I've always wanted." [...] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the game in Japan was {{accompanied}} by merchandise such as character costumes and accessories. The North American package of the game was released with a CD with selected music from the game, and, unlike Persona 3, the European package also contained a soundtrack CD. The music, as with the previous game, was composed primarily by Shoji Meguro. He was joined this time by Shihoko Hirata, who performed vocals on various songs, including the theme song [...] "Pursuing <b>My</b> <b>True</b> Self". The game was positively received by critics and developed into a full franchise. Various manga and light novel adaptations and spin-offs have been produced. An anime television adaptation by AIC ASTA, titled , aired in Japan between October 2011 and March 2012, with an anime adaptation of Persona 4 Golden, produced by A-1 Pictures, which began airing in July 2014.

To Baxter, he wrote, [...] "I am anxious that she should be brought up...like a philosopher, even like a cynic." [...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style.

Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37 million followers, with another 1.5 million followers on Instagram.|$|E
500|$|Lana Wachowski, a trans woman, {{has written}} her first {{transgender}} character {{in her career}} in the series: Nomi Marks. For that she partly used her own experiences. [...] "It has some very intense, autobiographical scenes, {{and that was very}} difficult and surreal," [...] said Lana. Jamie Clayton, who plays Nomi, has provided the example of a scene where a young Nomi is bullied by boys in a gym shower, as a scene that was based on experiences from Lana's life. Freema Agyeman, who plays Nomi's girlfriend Amanita, has shared that her character was based heavily on Lana's wife, Karin Winslow. Straczynski has stated that like Lana felt the close to Nomi when writing, he felt the closest to Wolfgang Bogdanow, because both him and Wolfgang had a bad relationship with their respective fathers. [...] "Wolfgang was <b>my</b> <b>true</b> north in the storytelling," [...] said Straczynski. Straczynski did not reveal who was the character Lilly Wachowski felt the closest to during the writing process, saying it's up to her to do that. Since then, Lilly has come out as transgender too. The beginning of her transitioning process preceded the release of the first season, and Clayton had known about it early on.|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing <b>my</b> <b>true</b> pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|At Thaxted, Holst became {{friendly}} with the Rev Conrad Noel, {{known as the}} [...] "Red Vicar", who supported the Independent Labour Party and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church; he also developed an interest in bell-ringing. He started an annual music festival at Whitsuntide in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School performed together with local participants. Holst's a cappella carol, [...] "This Have I Done For <b>My</b> <b>True</b> Love", was dedicated to Noel in recognition of {{his interest in the}} ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as [...] "The Dancing Day"). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's October Revolution, demanded in a Saturday message during the service {{that there should be a}} greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely [...] "camp followers" [...] caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{original}} {{score was}} primarily composed, arranged, and produced by Shoji Meguro. The soundtrack features songs with vocals by Shihoko Hirata, whom Meguro felt {{was able to}} meet the range of emotion needed for the soundtrack, with the lyrics being written by Reiko Tanaka. Meguro was given a rough outline of the game's plot and worked on the music in the same manner and simultaneously with the development of the story and spoken dialog, starting with the overall shape of the songs and eventually working on the finer details. According to Meguro, the songs [...] "Pursuing <b>My</b> <b>True</b> Self" [...] and [...] "Reach Out to the Truth" [...] were composed to reflect the inner conflicts of the game's main characters; the former song, used as the opening theme, helped to set an understanding of the characters' conflicts, while the latter, used in battle sequences, emphasized the [...] "strength of these characters to work through their internal struggles." [...] The [...] "Aria of the Soul" [...] theme used in the Velvet Room, a concept common to all the Persona games, remained relatively unchanged, with Meguro believing [...] "the shape of the song had been well-defined" [...] from previous games. Composers Atsushi Kitajoh and Ryota Koduka also contributed music for the game. Kitajoh, who had previously written music for Atlus with Growlanser VI and , contributed four themes to Persona 4, while Koduka wrote the [...] "Theme of Junes".|$|E
