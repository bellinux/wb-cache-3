5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> and {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a {{short but}} distinct stem, and only grows amongst sphagnum moss. Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12µm, while P.milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola: Commonly {{known as}} white {{mountain}} banksia, {{it is the}} only subspecies with a montane distribution; it occurs in the Blue Mountains of northern New South Wales.

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the Basque Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> into Basque society than other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E

5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|Older and <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> eroded, the Western Cascades are a {{range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E

5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused.

5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|In June 1453, Somerset {{was granted}} {{custody of the}} lordship of Glamorgan – part of the Despenser {{heritage}} held by Warwick until then – and open conflict broke out between the two men. Then, {{in the summer of}} that year, King Henry fell ill. Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret, and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in complete control of government. This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset, and drove him into collaboration with York. The political climate, influenced by the , then started turning against Somerset. On 27March 1454, a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York protector of the realm. York could now count on the support not only of Warwick, but also of Warwick's father Salisbury, who had become <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> involved in disputes with the Percys in the north of England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E

5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat <b>more</b> <b>deeply</b> cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5000|$|Chess engines {{increase}} in playing strength each year. This is {{partly due to}} the {{increase in}} processing power that enables calculations to be made to ever greater depths in a given time.
