50|$|In 1929, a man-powered {{ornithopter}} {{designed by}} Alexander Lippisch (designer of the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet) flew {{a distance of}} 250 to 300 metres after tow launch. Since a tow launch was used, some have questioned whether the aircraft was capable of flying on its own. Lippisch asserted that the aircraft was actually flying, not making an extended glide. (Precise <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> and velocity over time {{would be necessary to}} resolve this question.) Most of the subsequent human-powered ornithopters likewise used a tow launch, and flights were brief simply because human muscle power diminishes rapidly over time.|$|R

It is shown that in the geocorona the simultaneous <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> profiles <b>of</b> the 584 -A He dayglow intensity and polarization will test {{the hypothesis that the}} 584 -A dayglow is excited by resonance scattering of sunlight from geocoronal helium. If this is indeed the major source of the 584 -A dayglow emission, a simultaneous <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the polarization and the <b>altitude</b> profile <b>of</b> the intensity in the exosphere will uniquely determine the helium number density distribution as a function <b>of</b> <b>altitude,</b> and in the thermosphere it will alow a study of nondiffusive equilibrium processes.

50|$|The United States is {{the only}} industrialized nation that uses the {{international}} foot and the survey foot (a customary unit of length) in preference to the meter in its commercial, engineering, and standards activities. The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom; road signs must use imperial units (however distances on road signs are always marked in yards, not feet), while its usage is widespread among the British public as a <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> height. The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> in international aviation {{is one of the}} few areas where the foot is widely used outside the English-speaking world.|$|R

Each measurement represents an area 8 km E-W by 80 km N-S, the highest resolution attained to date. Altitude measurements obtained on different observing days were combined to produce altitude profiles for three complete rotations, each at different latitudes. Large-scale variations in altitudes cover a range <b>of</b> 14 km. <b>Altitude</b> changes <b>of</b> 5 in 30 km of longitude were observed.

40|$|The riometry {{technique}} {{is limited by}} its inability to directly determine the <b>altitude</b> <b>of</b> the principal ionospheric absorption layer during periods of enhanced Cosmic Noise Absorption (CNA). We describe here a technique based on the simple vertical parallax principle, enabling direct <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> this <b>altitude.</b> The technique utilizes the overlapping beams of two closely spaced imaging riometers in Antarctica. Descriptive statistics on peak absorption heights are presented. The <b>altitude</b> determination <b>of</b> a D-region absorption event and an event {{that occurred in the}} F-region near 200 km altitude are presented in more detail. The identification of an F-region event using the parallax technique confirms earlier findings that radiowave absorption in the F-region is a potentially significant contributor to CNA. This technique enables a simple and repeatable ground-based <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>altitude</b> <b>of</b> the CNA layer peak, and can be extended to estimating precipitation spectra based on peak absorption heights...|$|R

This is followed by a discussion of performance requirements for such instruments and an account of the methods of testing developed by the Bureau of Standards. The report concludes with a brief account of the results of recent investigations. For accurate <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude,</b> reference must also be made to thermometer readings of atmospheric temperature, since the altitude is not fixed by atmospheric pressure alone.

40|$|Three {{sources of}} errors, {{introduced}} into the air-data <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> and airspeed {{as a result of}} ground proximity, are evaluated. It is shown that the primary error results from ground constraint of the wing lifting pattern. Smaller errors result from constraint of the flow over the fuselage and of the engine exhaust. Equations are derived to provide corrections for the three error contributions. The equations are general and can be applied to airplanes of different geometries operating in different conditions. Applications illustrating different types of flight operations (takeoff and landing) are presented using CV- 990 data. Applications illustrating the effect of different static orifice locations (fuselage and nose-boom) are presented with YC- 15 data. Finally, an application to trajectory reconstruction is illustrated using DC- 10 data...|$|R
50|$|When the slopes, orientations, and {{elevations}} {{of thousands}} of gullies were compared, clear patterns emerged from the data. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitudes</b> and slopes <b>of</b> gullies {{support the idea that}} snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow.Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air <b>of</b> the higher <b>altitude.</b> For example, Thaumasia quadrangle is heavily cratered with many steep slopes. It is in the right latitude range, but its altitude is so high that there is not enough pressure to keep ice from sublimating (going directly from a solid to a gas); hence it does not have gullies. A large study done with several years worth of data from Mars Global Surveyor showed that there is a tendency for gullies to be on poleward facing slopes; these slopes have more shade that would keep snow from melting and allow large snowpacks to accumulate.|$|R

40|$|A {{closed-loop}} {{fault detection}} problem is investigated for the full-envelope flight vehicle with measurement delays, where the flight dynamics are modeled as a switched system with delayed feedback signals. The mode-dependent observer-based fault detection filters and state estimation feedback controllers are derived {{by considering the}} delays’ impact on the control system and fault detection system simultaneously. Then, considering updating lags of the controllers/filters’ switching signals which are introduced by the delayed <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> and Mach number, an asynchronous H∞ analysis method is proposed and the system model is further augmented to be an asynchronously switched time-delay system. Also, the global stability and desired performance of the augmented system are guaranteed by combining the switched delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method with the average dwell time method (ADT), and the delay-dependent existing conditions for the controllers and fault detection filters are obtained {{in the form of}} the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical example based on the hypersonic vehicles and highly maneuverable technology (HiMAT) vehicle is given to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|In-flight airdata {{calibrations}} {{are used}} to determine the aerodynamic influence of an airplane on pitot-static pressure <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> and speed. Conventional flight-test calibration techniques are briefly reviewed and meteorological analysis methods for estimating calibration reference values of atmospheric conditions are described. There are cases where some conventional in-flight techniques are not entirely satisfactory for research aircraft because of added equipment requirements or flight envelope and location limitations. In these cases, atmospheric wind and pressure information can be used to complement conventional techniques. Accuracy <b>of</b> the atmospheric <b>measurements</b> and the variability of upper-air winds and pressure values are discussed. Results from several flight research aircraft show that wind reference calibration is generally less accurate than calibration accuracy standards for civil and research aircraft. Examples of pressure reference altimetry derived from meteorological analyses are also presented for a variety of flight research programs. These flight data show that the reference pressure accuracy provided by meteorological analyses is usually within civil aircraft and flight research airdata calibration accuracy standards. Meteorological analyses altimetry is particularly useful when it is not feasible to restrict the test airplane altitude, location, or maneuver envelope...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a biologically {{inspired}} control system for directing a flying vehicle to fly at a desired altitude and groundspeed. The system is biologically inspired {{in the sense}} that it uses input only from sensors that have a biological counterpart, namely vision, air-current sensors, and inertial sensors. We are able to achieve flight at a desired altitude without an explicit <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude,</b> such as from a laser range finder. Using this altitude estimate, we are able to deduce, and thus control, groundspeed using optical flow input from a downward looking visual system, even in a windy environment. Although it is not possible to estimate altitude if the vehicle is flying with a constant velocity, we can control the vehicle to fly with a nearly constant velocity without explicitly perturbing the desired trajectory. This type of system has the advantage that it can function with the use of only passive sensors, thus minimizing detectability and power requirements, making it an attractive option for control of a micro aerial vehicle.

40|$|During the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, {{gases and}} Radiation Budget (ICARB) over India, {{high-resolution}} airborne <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>altitude</b> profiles <b>of</b> the mass concentrations (M_B) of aerosol black carbon (BC) were made off Bhubaneswar (BBR, 85. 82 ^oE, 20. 25 ^oN), over northwest Bay of Bengal, in the altitude region upto 3 km. Such high-resolution <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> profiles <b>of</b> aerosols are {{done for the}} first time over India. The profiles showed a near-steady vertical distribution of MB modulated with two small peaks, one at 800 m and the other at ∼ 2000 m. High resolution GPS (Global Positioning System) sonde (Vaisala) measurements around the same region onboard the research vessel Sagar Kanya (around the same time of the aircraft sortie) revealed two convectively well mixed layers, one from ground to ∼ 700 m with an inversion at the top and the other extends from 1200 m to ∼ 2000 m with a second inversion at ∼ 2200 m and a convectively stable region in the altitude range 700 – 1200 m. The observed peaks in the MB profile are found to be associated with these temperature inversions. In addition, long-range transport from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and deserts lying further to the west also influence the vertical profile of BC. Latitudinal variation of M_B showed a remarkable land ocean contrast at the 500 m altitude (within the well mixed region) with remarkably lower values over oceans, suggesting the impact of strong sources over the mainland. However, above the ABL (at 1500 m), the latitudinal variations were quite weak, and this appears to be resulting from the impact of long-range transport. Comparison <b>of</b> the <b>altitude</b> profiles <b>of</b> M_B over BoB off BBR with those obtained during the earlier occasion over the inland stations of Hyderabad and Kanpur showed similarities above ∼ 500 m, with MB remaining around a steady value of ∼ 1 μ g m^− 3. However, large differences are seen within the ABL. Even though the observed M_B values are not unusually high, their near constancy in the vertical column will have important implications to radiative forcing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>altitude</b> {{and ground}} {{movements}} are well-known problems in InSAR. With the refinement of the resolution, the same techniques {{can be considered}} for monitoring individual buildings. Since the measure of the height and the deformations are interlinked in the interferometric phase, a measure of the height is necessary to obtain the deformations. In this article, we monitor the deformations of the Eiffel Tower using 50 images acquired by TerraSAR-X, with a metric resolution. The height is obtained using a single pass interferogram acquired by TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. Then these measures are compared to weather data and optical strand fixed to the Eiffel Tower by the company OSMOS. The normalized correlation of the measured deformations with the minimum temperature measured on the acquisition dates is 0. 5 for the Eiffel Tower and the deformation measured by InSAR have the same order of magnitude than the deformation measured by the optical strands. To achieve local deformations measurement by interferometry, it is necessary to have the height of each pixel of the structure. This height can be obtained using a 3 D model, provided that the acquisition geometry and backscattering effects are taken into account. The deformations maps obtained using a 3 D model or a single pass interferogram have similar orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} systems {{being used for}} the effective and safe operation of an airplane is the Altitude Measurement Systems, a duty carried out {{by means of an}} Altimeter. The Altimeter output is affected by the input that is given to it. The input that is used by the Altimeter to show the desired altitude is nothing but the barometric pressure at the height at which the aircraft is travelling in. The barometric pressure is converted to the appropriate <b>altitude</b> by means <b>of</b> either Pitot Tubes or Sensors. The Pitot-tube is being used widely in all commercial airliners. The Pitot-Static systems are extremely susceptible to blockage by foreign bodies in case the aircraft sits on the tarmac for long time. To avoid contamination of the liquid which senses the change in pressure, the pitot-tubes are covered and if this cover is not removed, the pitot-tube gets blocked. Sensors are extremely susceptible to be burdened by ice, and in cases where the heating is not available in the place where the sensors are kept, erratic altitudes may result. It is therefore proposed, theoretically, to make efficient use of a four bar chain mechanism, called the Watt’s Indicator Mechanism, in order to eradicate the effects of blockage by foreign matter and burdening by ice and thereby promoting the effective <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Altitude</b> in Airplanes. This mechanism would be able to provide means <b>of</b> measuring <b>altitude</b> if calibrated appropriately...|$|R
40|$|According {{to climate}} model simulations, the {{changing}} <b>altitude</b> <b>of</b> {{middle and high}} clouds is the dominant contributor to the positive global mean longwave cloud feedback. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of this longwave cloud altitude feedback and its magnitude {{have not yet been}} verified by observations. Accurate, stable, and long-term observations of a metric-characterizing cloud vertical distribution that are related to the longwave cloud radiative effect are needed to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} mechanism <b>of</b> longwave cloud <b>altitude</b> feedback. This study shows that the direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>altitude</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric lidar opacity is a good candidate for the necessary observational metric. The opacity altitude is the level at which a spaceborne lidar beam is fully attenuated when probing an opaque cloud. By combining this altitude with the direct lidar <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the cloud-top <b>altitude,</b> we derive the effective radiative temperature of opaque clouds which linearly drives (as we will show) the outgoing longwave radiation. We find that, for an opaque cloud, a cloud temperature change of 1  K modifies its cloud radiative effect by 2  W m − 2. Similarly, the longwave cloud radiative effect of optically thin clouds can be derived from their top and base altitudes and an estimate of their emissivity. We show with radiative transfer simulations that these relationships hold true at single atmospheric column scale, on the scale of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instantaneous footprint, and at monthly mean 2 ° ×[*] 2 ° scale.

A flight on Feb. 2, 1973 from the Churchill Research Range provided 17 minutes of X-ray data above 28 km. The flight was made into an intense break-up event and X-ray fluxes were observed during two episodes of the explosive phase. The reduction of auroral absorption during the later phases of the event suggests precipitation of energetic electrons unaccompanied by the lower energy precipitation responsible for the absorption earlier in the substorm...|$|R

To take into account this variation of the sampling interval, an LPV polytopic controller is designed whose matrices are scheduled w. r. t this parameter.

This methodology is developed for AUV, which are a difficult to control using linear tools due to strong non linearities...|$|R
