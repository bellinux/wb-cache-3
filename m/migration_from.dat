5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward.

5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public.

Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E

5|$|<b>Migration</b> <b>from</b> Cyprus to the UK has {{occurred}} {{in part due to}} the colonial links between the countries and the internal conflict that followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E
5|$|Oral history {{offers several}} stories {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} the Sihanaka. Betsimisaraka traders may have been the first to reach the area traveling inland on the Maningory River. Another view posits that the presence of ancient earthen defensive trenches suggests the ancestors of the Merina may have passed by Lake Alaotra on their <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> the southeastern coast to the central highlands, leaving behind settlers whose descendants formed the first Sihanaka communities. Alternatively, a large group calling itself Sihanaka may have migrated from Imerina into the Alaotra area, which may have already been settled by individuals of various other ethnic groups, in order to maintain independence from the rule of the Merina king.|$|E

5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} {{and scope of}} aboriginal assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan has led to three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn.

New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century. Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} <b>migrations</b> <b>from</b> war-torn countries to the Persian (Arabian) Gulf. A growing number of studies focus on labour migrations to the oil-rich countries in the Gulf; yet, <b>migrations</b> <b>from</b> countries in armed conflict and refugee-producing countries to this region are still relatively unexplored. It is maintained {{that the vast majority}} of temporary labour migrants in the Gulf originate in countries that are not involved in devastating armed conflicts. <b>Migrations</b> <b>from</b> conflict-ridden countries to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) are not negligible, however, and they have been growing in the last decades, with Saudi Arabia attaining the role as the largest host. The overview of <b>migrations</b> <b>from</b> the major refugee-producing countries, such as Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan, suggests that we may distinguish between different categories of mixed migrations; inter alia, migrants who migrated to the Gulf prior to, during and after the armed conflicts in their home countries. We argue that these migrations happened in parallel with the tremendous economic growth that the Gulf countries have experienced in the last decades. Of note, however, is that they also coincide with escalations of armed conflicts in several sending countries, which may indicate that some of these migrations are also, directly or indirectly, the result of war- or security-related push forces. We also contend that the dynamics of <b>migrations</b> <b>from</b> countries in conflict may in addition be related to the foreign policies of the Gulf countries, which are often closely related to their treatment of different migrant groups...|$|R
