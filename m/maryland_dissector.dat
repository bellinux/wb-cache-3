30|$|Yes. Let {{us have a}} look at the “Precision-Drive-Articulating Instrument System” from TERUMO. It {{consists}} of 3 components, a console, a handle and individual instruments. The console and handle are captial equipment with long use life. The instruments include a needle driver, monopolar L-hook cautery, monopolar scissors, <b>Maryland</b> <b>dissector</b> /grasper and are reusable with limited-usage. They serve for all surgical tasks and can be used in combination with conventional instruments.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pioneers {{in natural}} orifice transvaginal {{cholecystectomy}} are {{in search of}} an approach that uses less percutaneous assistance. The approach must be safe and affordable. The authors present a successful cholecystectomy using a technique of transvaginal operative laparoscopy with no abdominal ports. Methods: A 24 -year-old female patient with gallbladder lithiasis underwent a natural orifice cholecystectomy with only one transvaginal 12 -mm port, using a laparoscope with a working channel. We used laparoscopic instruments 5 mm in diameter by 43 cm in length (including a needle holder, <b>Maryland</b> <b>dissector</b> clamp, spatula, hook, suction cannula, and clip applier) and assistance with percutaneous marionette leashes. Results: The patient stayed in the hospital for 24 hours and was discharged without pain and without scars. Conclusion: Transvaginal cholecystectomy performed using an operative laparoscope with a working channel is possible in select cases. This technique requires no abdominal ports and is an alternative to culdolaparoscopy or hybrid transvaginal procedures with flexible endoscopes...|$|E
40|$|Robotic pelvic lymphadenectomy {{is a well}} {{established}} procedure in the urologic and gynecologic literature. To our knowledge robotic pelvic lymphadectomy for metastatic melanoma {{has yet to be}} described. Herein we present the first report of robot-assisted pelvic lymphadenectomy in malignant melanoma. After placement of six laparoscopic ports (12  mm camera, three 8 -mm robotic ports, 12 -mm and 5 -mm assistant ports) the DaVinci S robot (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA) was docked in standard fashion with the patient in low lithotomy. In both cases the patients had enlarged pelvic lymph nodes on computed tomography and complete excision of these masses was accomplished along with complete lymphadenectomy extending from Cooper’s ligament to just below the hypogastric artery in case 1 and to level of the bifurcation of aorta in case 2. A PK <b>Maryland</b> <b>Dissector</b> and monopolar scissors were used for dissection. Both patients were discharged on postoperative day # 1. Robotic pelvic lymphadenectomy can be safely used for management of patients with metastatic melanoma involving the pelvic lymph nodes. Compared with the standard open procedure, pelvic lymphadenectomy with robotic assistance is associated with excellent vision and minimum morbidity...|$|E
