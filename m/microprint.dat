5|$|The swallow cowrie is {{featured}} on the obverse background of the $1,000 banknote. Its reverse carries the theme of government featuring the buildings of the three branches of government: The Parliament House, Old Supreme Court Building and Istana, representing the Legislative, Judiciary and Executive powers respectively. The Istana is the president's official residence, built in 1869 which first housed the colonial governor. The entire national anthem's lyrics are included as <b>microprint,</b> which is a unique feature to the $1,000 banknote.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party {{issued a}} limited amount of {{banknotes}} commemorating the Jayuya Uprising. The series included pesos of six denominations, including $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The designs of all banknotes feature Pedro Albizu Campos in the front side while the reverses are adorned with the flags of Puerto Rico, Jayuya and the Nationalist Party. <b>Microprint</b> with the names of Pedro Albizu Campos and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos are found throughout the pesos. On July 10, 2005, Liberty Dollar of Puerto Rico was created by Alfredo Pacheco Martínez. Silver ounces began circulating on October 8, 2005, marking {{the first time that a}} silver coin was distributed in more than a century. After an intervention with parent company Liberty Services concluded with its assets being confiscated, leading to a process that resulted in the indictment and conviction of founder Bernard von NotHaus, Pacheco Martínez continued to circulate the coins under the name of Dólar Boricua. In August 2010, he was also indicted on the same charges faced by Von NotHaus. Pacheco Martínez was found guilty on June 29, 2012, being subsequently sentenced to 19 years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Jamestown, Virginia {{settlement}} was commemorated on its 400th anniversary with a 41-cent stamp issued on May 11, 2007. The stamp is triangle-shaped {{as was the}} original fort located there. The selvage area {{on the front of}} 20-stamp sheets showed a painting of early Jamestown by Richard Schlect, reviewed by archeologists then excavating the original site. Banknote Corporation of America printed 60 million in the offset process with <b>microprint</b> “USPS”.|$|E
2500|$|Currency {{commonly}} exhibits {{the highest}} quality (smallest size) of <b>microprint</b> because it demands {{the highest level of}} counterfeiting deterrence. [...] For example, on the series 2004 United States $20 bill, <b>microprint</b> is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side as well as the Twenty USA background.|$|E
2500|$|While microphotography precedes <b>microprint,</b> <b>microprint</b> was {{significantly}} influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 {{when he was}} inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni {{that if he could}} reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. [...] Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop <b>microprint,</b> a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. ( [...] , [...] ) [...] This process proved to produce a 6" [...] by 9" [...] index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing. [...] Boni began the Readex <b>Microprint</b> company to produce and license this technology. [...] He also published an article , which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Microprinting,</b> On {{numerous}} {{areas of}} the banknotes you can see <b>microprinting,</b> for example, inside the [...] "ΕΥΡΩ" [...] (EURO in Greek characters) on the front. You will need a magnifying glass to see it. The tiny text is sharp, and not blurred.|$|R
2500|$|Bank cheques as well {{as various}} other items of value may also {{commonly}} leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size. [...] For example, personal bank cheques commonly denote the characters MP next to the signature line of the check; these characters represent <b>microprint</b> and are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficultly in being reproduced and simple deterrent as a warning that the item employs <b>microprint.</b>|$|E

2500|$|To {{cope with}} the {{deregulation}} of imports of color printers and {{the increasing use of}} computers and scanners, modified 5,000- and 10,000-won notes were released between 1994 and 2002 with various new security features, which included color-shifting ink, <b>microprint,</b> segmented metal thread, moiré, and EURion constellation. The latest version of the 5,000- and 10,000-won notes are easily identifiable by the copyright information inscribed under the watermark: [...] "" [...] and year of issue on the obverse, [...] "© The Bank of Korea" [...] and year of issue on the reverse.|$|E
2500|$|Microprinting is the {{production}} of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye. [...] To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. [...] <b>Microprint</b> is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by digital methods.|$|E
