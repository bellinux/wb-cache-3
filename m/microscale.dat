5|$|Wind shear is a <b>microscale</b> {{meteorological}} phenomenon occurring over {{a very small}} distance, {{but it can be}} associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts. It is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms, fronts, areas of locally higher low-level winds referred to as low level jets, near mountains, radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds, buildings, wind turbines, and sailboats. Wind shear has significant effects on control of an aircraft effect, and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents.|$|E

5000|$|Taylor <b>microscales</b> : The {{intermediate}} scales {{between the}} largest and the smallest scales which make the inertial subrange. Taylor <b>microscales</b> are not dissipative scale but pass down the energy from the largest to the smallest without dissipation. Some literatures do not consider Taylor <b>microscales</b> as a characteristic length scale and consider the energy cascade to contain only {{the largest and}} smallest scales; while the latter accommodate both the inertial subrange and the viscous sublayer. Nevertheless, Taylor <b>microscales</b> are often used in describing the term “turbulence” more conveniently as these Taylor <b>microscales</b> play a dominant role in energy and momentum transfer in the wavenumber space.|$|R

It {{is important to}} note that for Sc>1, which is common in many liquid flows, the Batchelor scale is small when compared to the Kolmogorov <b>microscales.</b> This means that scalar transport occurs at scales smaller than the smallest eddy size.|$|R

The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macroscale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves.

500|$|Waterspouts {{exist on}} a <b>microscale,</b> where their {{environment}} {{is less than}} two kilometers in width. The cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds {{are in the process}} of development, and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm.

500|$|The {{effects of}} the urban heat island may be overstated. One study stated, [...] "Contrary to {{generally}} accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of urbanization {{could be found in}} annual temperatures." [...] This was done by using satellite-based night-light detection of urban areas, and more thorough homogenisation of the time series (with corrections, for example, for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation, and thus cooler, than urban areas). If its conclusion is accepted, then it is necessary to [...] "unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban in situ stations could show no contamination from urban warming."

[...] Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes, all of which result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone. [...] Meteorologists use the term [...] "cyclone" [...] where circular pressure systems flow {{in the direction of the}} Earth's rotation, which normally coincides with areas of low pressure. [...] The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. [...] Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones, mesocyclones, and polar lows lie within the smaller mesoscale. [...] Subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size. Cyclogenesis can occur at various scales, from the <b>microscale</b> to the synoptic scale. [...] Larger-scale troughs, also called Rossby waves, are synoptic in scale. [...] Shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale, or mesoscale in nature. [...] Both Rossby waves and shortwaves embedded within the flow around Rossby waves migrate equatorward of the polar cyclones located in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. [...] All share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. [...] Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lowers surface pressure.|$|E

40|$|Gravity stands {{apart from}} other {{fundamental}} interactions {{in that it is}} locally equivalent to an accelerated frame and can be transformed away. Again it is indistinguishable from the geometry of space-time (which is an arena for all other basic interactions), its strength being linked with the curvature.

It is also evident that new ideas are required to resolve several conundrums in areas like cosmology, black hole physics, and particles at high energies. That gravity can have strong coupling at <b>microscales</b> has also been suggested in several contexts earlier.
