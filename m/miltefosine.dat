25|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> is {{the first}} oral {{treatment}} for this disease. The cure rate of <b>miltefosine</b> in Phase III clinical trials is 95%; Studies in Ethiopia show that is also effective in Africa. In HIV immunosuppressed people which are coinfected with leishmaniasis it has shown that even in resistant cases 2/3 of the people responded to this new treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> has {{received}} {{approval by the}} Indian regulatory authorities in 2002, in Germany in 2004 and in U.S.A. in 2014. It is now registered in many countries.|$|E
25|$|The drug is {{generally}} better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbance {{in the first}} or second day of treatment (a course of treatment is 28 days) which does not affect the efficacy. Because it is available as an oral formulation, the expense and inconvenience of hospitalization is avoided, and outpatient distribution of the drug becomes an option, making <b>Miltefosine</b> a drug of choice.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and <b>miltefosine.</b> For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. <b>Miltefosine,</b> an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|New {{treatment}} options are {{arising from the}} new oral drug <b>miltefosine</b> (Impavido) which has shown in several clinical trials to be very efficient and safe in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Recent studies from Bolivia show a high cure rate for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Comparative studies against pentavalent antimonials in Iran and Pakistan are also beginning to show a high cure rate for L. major and L. tropica. It is registered in many countries of Latin America, as well in Germany. In October 2006 it received orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug administration. The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances in the 1–2 days of treatment which {{does not affect the}} efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug <b>miltefosine</b> was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the {{two most}} recent {{successfully}} treated cases in the United States utilized drug combinations that included the medication <b>miltefosine</b> as well as targeted temperature management. There is currently no data on how well <b>miltefosine</b> is able to reach the central nervous system. The U.S. CDC is currently offering <b>miltefosine</b> to doctors {{for the treatment of}} free-living ameobas including naegleria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> {{primarily}} acts on Leishmania {{by affecting}} the species promastigote and amastigote stages. <b>Miltefosine</b> exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death. This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial {{function of the}} parasite.|$|E
50|$|It is {{an analog}} of <b>miltefosine</b> and perifosine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> {{is listed}} as {{pregnancy}} category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus. [...] Despite this evidence, {{the potential benefits of}} <b>miltefosine</b> may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective birth control should be used while on <b>miltefosine</b> and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{recommended}} <b>miltefosine</b> for {{the treatment}} of free-living amebae infections such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, two fatal protozoal diseases. Historically, only four survivors have been recorded out of 138 confirmed infections in North America. One American survived the infection in 1978 and one individual from Mexico in 2003. In 2013, two children survived and recovered from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after treatment with <b>miltefosine.</b> In 2016 after treatment that included <b>miltefosine,</b> another child became the fourth person in the United States to survive Naegleria fowleri infection.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{there were}} reports of failure of <b>miltefosine</b> in the {{treatment}} of leishmaniasis. Although drug resistance was suspected, studies in 2014 reported that <b>miltefosine</b> is not so effective in children, most probably related to a lack of drug exposure in children. Moverover, males appeared to have a higher probability of relapse as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> is {{approved}} for leishmaniasis and {{under investigation for}} other indications including HIV.|$|E

50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> is now commercially {{available}} in the United States through Profounda. Previously one could only get it from the CDC for emergency use under an expanded access IND protocol for treatment of free-living amoeba (FLA) infections): primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba species. <b>Miltefosine</b> is also produced by Profounda, a private pharmaceutical company.|$|E
5000|$|Animal {{studies suggest}} <b>miltefosine</b> {{may also be}} {{effective}} against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas' disease.|$|E
50|$|In many countries, {{widespread}} {{resistance to}} antimony {{has meant that}} amphotericin or <b>miltefosine</b> are now used in preference.|$|E
50|$|An {{in vitro}} test in 2006 showed that <b>miltefosine</b> is {{effective}} against the deadly protozoan pathogens, Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba. However, later {{studies showed that}} it is not as potent as other drugs, such as chlorpromazine and diminazene aceturate (Berenil). In 2014 it was reported that treatment of Acanthamoeba encephalitis in a 63-year-old immunosuppressed male was not cured by a combination of <b>miltefosine,</b> sulfadiazine, fluconazole, flucytosine, and azithromycin.|$|E
5000|$|Cetrimonium bromide, a {{compound}} related to <b>miltefosine,</b> was demonstrated in 2007 to exhibit potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum.|$|E
5000|$|A 2006 {{in vitro}} {{study found that}} <b>miltefosine</b> is {{effective}} against metronidazole-resistant variants of Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted protozoal disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> is {{primarily}} {{used for the}} treatment of visceral and New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, and is undergoing clinical trials for this use in several countries. This drug is now listed as a core medication {{for the treatment of}} leishmaniasis under the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Several medical agents have some efficacy against visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, a 2005 survey concluded that <b>miltefosine</b> is the only effective oral treatment for both forms of leishmaniasis.|$|E

50|$|Common {{side effects}} from <b>miltefosine</b> {{treatment}} are nausea and vomiting, which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> targets HIV {{infected}} macrophages, which {{play a role}} in vivo as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein Tat activates pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway {{in primary}} human macrophages. <b>Miltefosine</b> acts by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells. It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in the human cells.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Ridley et al {{recommended}} {{the development of}} a priority review voucher (PRV) in the journal Health Affairs. It gained interest by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas who championed its introduction in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. Under the enacted law, FDA approval of a non-NTD drug can be accelerated through the drug review process if paired to a drug that addresses a NTD. The potential economic benefit to a pharmaceutical company is estimated to be potentially as high as $300 million per drug. Three drugs have earned NTD PRVs to date (December 2014): Coartem (by Novartis, for malaria); bedaquiline (by Janssen, for TB) and <b>miltefosine</b> (by Knight, for leishmaniasis). However, the success of the PRV system is now under much scrutiny, given that Knight benefitted by $125 million from the sale of a PRV earned from a drug (<b>miltefosine)</b> that was largely researched and developed by the WHO. Medicins San Frontiers are now pressuring Knight to guarantee supplying <b>miltefosine</b> at cost price, thus far without success.|$|E
50|$|A toxic ether lipid {{analogue}} <b>miltefosine</b> {{has recently}} been introduced as an oral treatment for the tropical disease leishmaniasis, which is caused by leishmania, a protozoal parasite with a particularly high ether lipid content in its membranes.|$|E
50|$|Single dose AmBisome® & paromomycin/miltefosine/AmBisome® {{combinations}} were {{recommended by}} the WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Leishmaniasis (2010). These treatments are less toxic than previous mainstay treatments, useful in areas of antimonial resistance, are shorter course and their cost is comparable with previous treatments. In 2010, a study investigating the three possible 2-drug combinations of amphotericin B (AmBisome), <b>miltefosine</b> and paromomycin was completed in India. All three combination treatments were shown to be highly efficacious (> 97.5% cure rate). A WHO Expert committee recommended these treatments to be used preferentially to current established monotherapy treatments for VL in South Asia. DNDi is working with TDR and WHO to facilitate their introduction and support VL elimination strategies. DNDi conducted more studies, including a pilot project in the Bihar State of India (2012-2015) that demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of combination therapies based on AmBisome®, <b>miltefosine</b> and paromomycin at the primary healthcare level, and single dose AmBisome® at the hospital level. Based on the study results, the Indian National Roadmap for Kala-Azar Elimination in August 2014 recommended use of single dose AmBisome® as a first option treatment {{for the treatment of}} VL patients, with paromycin and <b>miltefosine</b> as a second option at all levels; a policy also reflected in Bangladesh and Nepal. this removal of <b>miltefosine</b> monotherapy is an important policy change. This project has been a collaboration with the National (Vector Borne) Disease Control Programmes of India and Bangladesh, MSF, TDR, OneWorld Health/PATH, Bihar State Health Society and the Indian Council for Medical Research.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{antimicrobial}} treatment {{consists of}} antifungal drug amphotericin B, but the fatality rate {{even with this}} treatment is greater than 95%. [...] New treatments are being sought. <b>Miltefosine,</b> an antiparasitic, {{has been used in}} a few cases with mixed results.|$|E
50|$|Perifosine (also KRX-0401) {{is a drug}} {{candidate}} being developed {{for a variety of}} cancer indications.It is an alkyl-phospholipid structurally related to <b>miltefosine.</b> It acts as an Akt inhibitor and a PI3K inhibitor.It was being developed by Keryx Biopharmaceuticals who have licensed it from Æterna Zentaris Inc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Impavido among others, is a {{medication}} mainly {{used to treat}} leishmaniasis and free-living amoeba infections such as Naegleria fowleri.

50|$|Sodium stibogluconate, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Pentostam among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat leishmaniasis. This includes leishmaniasis of the cutaneous, visceral, and mucosal types. Some combination of <b>miltefosine,</b> paramycin and liposomal amphotericin B, however, may be recommended due to issues with resistance. It is given by injection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Miltefosine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in individuals}} who have a hypersensitivity to this medication, pregnant women, {{and people who have}} the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and teratogenic in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and contraception is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age.|$|E
