5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s {{as he began to}} identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He became a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E
5|$|Nunn {{oversaw the}} entry of the University of Louisville into the state's public {{university}} system. Fulfilling a campaign promise, he helped transform Northern Kentucky Community College into Northern Kentucky State College (which later became Northern Kentucky University), a four-year institution and <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> university system. Historian Lowell H. Harrison argued that these actions diluted state support to existing higher education institutions. Nunn also supported the newly created Kentucky Educational Television.|$|E

5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> board of education were named as defendants in the case.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans and a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all white}} males in New Hampshire {{between the ages}} of 18 and 45, Pierce was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> militia, and was {{appointed}} aide de camp to Governor Samuel Dinsmoor in 1831. He remained in the militia until 1847, and attained the rank of colonel before becoming a brigadier general in the Army during the Mexican–American War. Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812, Pierce worked with Alden Partridge, president of Norwich University, a military college in Vermont, and Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman, Norwich faculty members and militia officers, to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness. Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859, and received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Norwich in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Sumner sat on {{the court}} when it heard the appeals in the Quock Walker cases in 1783, {{concerning}} a former slave who was seeking confirmation of his freedom. A ruling {{in one of these}} cases confirmed that the state constitution had effectively abolished slavery. In 1785 he was chosen by the legislature to sit on a committee which revised the laws of the state, to modernize them and remove references to British authority. In 1789 he was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> convention that met to ratify the United States Constitution, in which he explained to the convention the meaning and importance of habeas corpus. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.|$|E

5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Leane {{was made}} an Officer of the Order of Saint John, and also {{received}} the King George VI Coronation Medal. In {{the same year}} he introduced training in morse code for police officers, presaging the introduction of radio to the police force. In 1938, Leane {{was placed on the}} retired list of military officers, having reached 60 years of age. His service in the police was extended by an act of Parliament allowing him to serve until he was 65. Leane's continuing concern about traffic accidents and their consequences was highlighted by a map maintained in his office, on which all accidents were marked. In April 1939, with the danger of war in Europe, Leane became a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Emergency Civil Defence Council, with responsibilities for internal security, protection of vulnerable points, control of the civil population, intelligence, detention of enemy civil aircraft, civil flying, and the air examination service.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{had been}} drawn into Virginia {{politics}} even as a U.S. Senator. From October 1829 to January 1830, {{he served as a}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> constitutional convention, a role which he had been reluctant to accept. The original Virginia Constitution gave outsize influence to the state's more conservative eastern counties, as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county (regardless of population) and only granted suffrage to property owners. The convention gave the more populous and liberal counties of western Virginia an opportunity to expand their influence. Tyler, a slaveowner from eastern Virginia, supported the existing system. He largely remained on the sidelines during the debate, however, not wishing to alienate any of the state's political factions. He was focused on his Senate career, which required a broad base of support, and gave speeches during the convention promoting compromise and unity.|$|E
