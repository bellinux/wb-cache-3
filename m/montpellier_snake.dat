The Balkan terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) can be found near fresh water along with the Greek marsh frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri), though this habitat is slowly disappearing due to development. The Balkan wall lizard (Podarcis taurica) is seen {{regularly}} in daylight in warm weather and the Hemidactylus turcicus at night. A larger lizard is the Balkan green lizard (Lacerta trilineata). Several varieties of snakes can be observed: the <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> (Malpolon monspessulanus), the leopard snake (Elephe situla), the large whip snake (Coluber jugularis), the grass snake (Natrix natrix), and a species of viper.|$|E

50|$|El Torcal {{supports}} {{an impressive}} array of wildflowers including rock-dwellers like Linaria anticaria, Saxifraga biternata, Linaria oblongifolia, Viola demetria, Saxifraga reuterana, Polypodium australe, and other plants like lilies, nazarenes, red peonies, wild rose trees and thirty varieties of orchid. The many species of reptiles include the <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> and ocellated lizard, both endemic to El Torcal. Other life includes the Griffon vulture, the Spanish Ibex (Andalusian mountain goat), and nocturnal mammals such as badgers, weasels and rodents.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{reptiles}} of Cyprus are harmless, and non-venomous {{such as the}} Cyprus {{whip snake}} (Hierophis cypriensis) and the European blind snake (Typhlops vermicularis). Other snakes, European cat snake (Telescopus fallax) and <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> (Malpolon monspessulanus) are nominally venomous, but neither aggressive nor particularly dangerous. In contrast, the Cyprian blunt-nosed viper, (Macrovipera lebetina lebetina), though not aggressive, is a large, front-fanged viper. Its bite is dangerous even to large mammals, including people. Three of the reptile species on Cyprus, including Macrovipera lebetina, are endangered.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} species of lizard {{in the nature}} reserve, six snakes and an amphisbaenian. This last is a small, {{subterranean}} reptile that has no legs and no eyes. The most common lizard is the small green or brown Iberian wall lizard. The larger Algerian sand racer and the mainly nocturnal Moorish gecko are also common. Rarer lizards are the Turkish gecko and the ocellated lizard. Snakes include the horseshoe whip snake, <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake,</b> southern smooth snake, false smooth snake, grass snake and ladder snake.|$|E
5000|$|The Aesculapian snake [...] (now Zamenis longissimus, {{previously}} Elaphe longissima), is {{a species}} of nonvenomous snake native to Europe, {{a member of the}} Colubrinae subfamily of the family Colubridae. Growing up to 2 m in total length (including tail), it counts among the largest European snakes, though not as massive as the four-lined snake (Elaphe quatuorlineata) or the <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> (Malpolon monspessulanus). The Aesculapian snake has been of cultural and historical significance for its role in ancient Greek and Roman mythology and derived symbolism.|$|E

50|$|Although it is venomous, only a {{few cases}} of {{envenomation}} of humans are known, one of which occurred when a finger was inserted into the snake's mouth. The <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> is not a dangerous snake for humans. The rear fangs reduce the possibility of venom injection, and the venom is of low toxicity. Venom injections are possible in bites of big individuals. The venom is not very dangerous; symptomatic treatment suffices to treat an envenomation. The unthreatening nature of the snake, along with its relatively mild persecution by man, has made {{it one of the}} most common species throughout its range, even in areas occupied by humans.|$|E
50|$|At {{the rich}} wetland {{habitats}} of Akyatan, hylidae, marsh frog and European green toad {{can be observed}} in large numbers. There are also records of observed European otter. The area is also rich with reptiles; the common species are green turtle and loggerhead turtle. Green turtle is a globally endangered species and in the Mediterranean, the species is considered as critically endangered (IUCN 2000) with only 200-300 nesting females remaining, 43% of all nests being at Akyatan, making it the most significant breeding areas of green turtles at the Mediterranean. Adding Kazanlı and Samandağ beaches, Çukurova region holds 62% of the Mediterranean nesting population. Caspian turtle and swamp turtle is common at the fresh water ponds and canals. Tortoise is seen often at the dunes. The other reptiles common at the dunes are; <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake,</b> coluber, lacertidae, mabuya aurata, chameleon, cyrtopodion, agama stellio.|$|E
50|$|Attenborough {{opens the}} series at the Dead Sea, where the hot climate and intense {{evaporation}} mimic conditions that were replicated {{on a much}} larger scale when the newly formed Mediterranean basin dried out. Around 5.5 million years ago, the Atlantic flooded the basin, allowing marine life to recolonise the new sea. Mountains became islands: some of them volcanic, others formed of limestone. Common species marooned on these islands evolved into new varieties. In a Maltese cave, Attenborough discovers fossil teeth from dwarf elephants. Most are only known from fossils, but one species, the Mallorcan midwife toad, has recently been discovered. Attenborough abseils down to a secluded pool to find it. In Europe, blooming wildflowers signal the arrival of spring. This triggers the emergence of insects, and in turn, the arrival of insectivorous birds such as rollers and bee-eaters. After the Mediterranean Sea formed, the climate continued to warm, forcing many birds to extend their migration routes between Europe and Africa. Exotic arrivals include spoonbills, white storks and flamingos. Reptiles are most active during the hot summers. Attenborough catches a <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> and describes its hunting behaviour. Some creatures, including chameleons, crested porcupines and fruit bats have colonised Europe from Africa. Rock hyraxes, which have reached Israel, may soon join them. The arrival of humans, 28,000 years ago, is known from flint tools and rock etchings found in Spanish caves. Later cliff paintings demonstrated that Mediterranean man was still living in hunter-gatherer societies 10,000 years ago, but that would soon change.|$|E

These nerves emerge from the sensory epithelium of Jacobson’s organ simultaneously. The bundles of the terminal and vomeronasal nerves traverse together the cavity of the nasal capsule in their way to the brain. These nerves bear scattered ganglionic cells which represent the ganglion terminale. They leave the capsule through the foramen olfactorium advehens. The terminal and vomeronasal nerves are connected with the olfactory nerve and enter the olfactory formation of the forebrain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>Montpellier</b> <b>snake</b> Malpolon monspessulanus is {{a wide-ranging}} species that inhabits Western and East-ern Europe, North Africa and Middle East. Four clades have been {{recognised}} as two species, M. insignitus and M. monspessulanus, each with two subspecies. Clades have been substantially identified {{on the basis}} of molecular data, pholidosis and colouration, while morphometric traits have been ignored. We compared head shape of 54 specimens belonging to three out of the four clades (M. insignitus insignitus, M. i. fuscus, and M. monspessulanus monspessu-lanus) by means of geometric morphometrics. We found a significant differentiation: the supraocular and frontal area showed the largest amount of variation, being respectively much thinner in M. i. insignitus, a bit less thin in M. i. fuscus and definitely wider in M. m. monspessulanus. Our findings are fully in agreement with the genetic studies and phylogeny explains more than 20 % of the observed variation, supporting the taxonomic distinction inside the genus Malpolon. The functional and/or adaptive meaning of the observed differences is not clear, but it seems unlikely that it may be related to diet.
