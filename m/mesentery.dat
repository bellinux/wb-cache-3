5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. The gut runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The {{intestine}} runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The gut and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another <b>mesentery</b> connects the gut to the intestine.|$|E
5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} <b>mesentery,</b> inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the <b>mesentery,</b> hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
50|$|Stony corals, order Scleractinia, {{have the}} <b>mesenteries</b> {{arranged}} radially in pairs which develop cyclically. The <b>mesenteries</b> deposit calcium carbonate which forms a stony ridge, the septum, between {{each pair of}} <b>mesenteries</b> and builds the corallite, the cup in which the polyp sits.|$|R
50|$|Soft corals, order Alcyonacea, {{have eight}} primary <b>mesenteries</b> which {{alternate}} with the eight tentacles. The <b>mesenteries</b> are complete and unpaired and bear unilobed filaments.|$|R
40|$|The {{sea anemone}} Anthopfeura elegantissima forms clonal aggregations on rocky shores along the Pacific Coast of North America {{by a process}} of {{longitudinal}} fission. Fission can occur by lateral stretching of the column and separation of the two halves followed by internal regeneration of parts of the actinopharynx and of the column. Two new directive <b>mesenteries,</b> one siphonoglyph, and several pairs of <b>mesenteries</b> flanking the directives also form. Alternatively, large individuals appear to form new directive <b>mesenteries</b> and siphonoglyphs {{well in advance of}} divisio...|$|R
25|$|The <b>mesentery</b> of {{the small}} {{intestine}} arises from {{the root of the}} <b>mesentery</b> (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15cm long, 20cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at {{the left side of the}} second lumbar vertebra to the right sacroiliac articulation. The root of the <b>mesentery</b> extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section {{of the small}} intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the greater omentum.|$|E
25|$|The sigmoid {{mesocolon}} is {{that region}} of the <b>mesentery</b> to which the sigmoid colon is attached at the gastrointestinal mesenteric margin.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{is connected}} to the <b>mesentery</b> in the lower region of the ileum, by a short region of the mesocolon known as the mesoappendix.|$|E
5000|$|The septa are {{secreted}} by the <b>mesenteries,</b> and {{are therefore}} added {{in the same order}} as the <b>mesenteries</b> are. As a result, septa of different ages are adjacent to one another, and the symmetry of the scleractinian skeleton is radial or biradial. This pattern of septal insertion is termed [...] "cyclic" [...] by paleontologists. By contrast, in some fossil corals, adjacent septa lie in order of increasing age, a pattern termed serial and produces a bilateral symmetry. Scleractinians secrete a stony exoskeleton in which the septa are inserted between the <b>mesenteries</b> in multiples of six.|$|R
50|$|Portions of the gut {{tube and}} its derives are {{suspended}} from the dorsal and ventral body wall by <b>mesenteries,</b> double layers of peritoneum that enclose an organ and connect it to the body wall. Such organs are called intraperitoneal, whereas organs that lie against the posterior body wall and are covered by peritoneum on their anterior surface only are considered retroperitoneal. So, <b>mesenteries</b> are double layers of peritoneum that pass from one organ to another or from an organ to the body wall as a peritoneal ligament. <b>Mesenteries</b> provide pathways for vessels, nerves, and lymphatic structures to and from abdominal viscera.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the editor}} of Gray's Anatomy Professor Susan Standring, <b>mesentery</b> has been known for {{thousands}} of years. The classical anatomical description of the mesocolon is credited to British surgeon Sir Frederick Treves in 1885, although a description of the membrane as a single structure dates back to at least Leonardo da Vinci. Treves is known for performing the first appendectomy in England in 1888; he was surgeon to both Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He studied the human <b>mesentery</b> and peritoneal folds in 100 cadavers and described the right and left mesocolons as vestigial or absent in the human adult. Accordingly, the small intestinal <b>mesentery,</b> transverse, and sigmoid mesocolons all terminated or attached at their insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. These assertions were included in mainstream surgical, anatomical, embryological, and radiologic literature for more than a century.|$|E
25|$|The spleen {{develops}} from mesenchymal cells {{between layers}} of the dorsal <b>mesentery</b> of the stomach. The thymus arises as {{an outgrowth of the}} third pharyngeal pouch.|$|E
25|$|Clarifications of the {{mesenteric}} anatomy have facilitated {{a clearer}} understanding of diseases involving the <b>mesentery,</b> examples of which include malrotation and Crohn's disease (CD). In CD, the <b>mesentery</b> is frequently thickened, rendering haemostasis challenging. In addition, fat wrapping—creeping fat—involves extension of mesenteric fat over {{the circumference of}} contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.|$|E

50|$|Sea anemones, order Actiniaria, have {{at least}} eight {{complete}} <b>mesenteries</b> and a variable number of incomplete ones near the base. The functional significance of the <b>mesenteries</b> in sea anemones is unclear. Their margins are involved in only {{a limited amount of}} digestion and absorption, so their chief function may be to provide support to help the animal maintain its shape.|$|R
5000|$|In the phylum Cnidaria and {{the class}} Anthozoa, the <b>mesenteries</b> are sheet-like {{partitions}} that extend from the body wall of the animal into its gastrovascular cavity. They are composed of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. They can either be [...] "complete", joining the gastrodermis of the body wall {{with that of the}} pharynx, or [...] "incomplete", extending only part way into the cavity (the terms [...] "perfect" [...] and [...] "imperfect" [...] are sometimes used instead). They stretch from the pedal disc to the oral disc, and there are two perforations or ostia near the oral disc. <b>Mesenteries</b> are usually in pairs. The free edge of incomplete <b>mesenteries</b> are thickened to form glandular, ciliated bands called mesenterial filaments. The lower ends of the mesenterial filaments are elongated into acontia which are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells) and can protrude through the body wall or mouth. The gonads are situated on the <b>mesenteries</b> alongside the mesenterial filaments.|$|R
25|$|Thrombosis of the {{superior}} mesenteric vein can cause mesenteric ischemia also known as ischemic bowel. Mesenteric ischemia can also result from {{the formation of a}} volvulus, a twisted loop of the small intestine that when it wraps around itself and also encloses the <b>mesentery</b> too tightly can cause ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo studied {{internal}} organs, {{being the}} first to draw the human appendix and the lungs, <b>mesentery,</b> urinary tract, reproductive organs, {{the muscles of the}} cervix and a detailed cross-section of coitus. He {{was one of the first}} to draw a scientific representation of the fetus in the intrautero.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local peristalsis, or due to a lesion that the <b>mesentery</b> may twist around (such as an ascarid impaction), and usually involves the distal jejunum and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small intestinal volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small intestinal obstruction causes distention and then rotation around the root of the <b>mesentery.</b> Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small intestinal involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E

50|$|In {{the class}} Hydrozoa, the polyps are indeed often very simple, like the common little fresh water {{species of the}} genus Hydra. Anthozoan polyps, {{including}} the corals and sea anemones, are much more complex due {{to the development of}} a tubular stomodaeum leading inward from the mouth and a series of radial partitions called <b>mesenteries.</b> Many of the <b>mesenteries</b> project into the enteric cavity but some extend from the body wall to the central stomodaeum.|$|R
25|$|The next lymph sac {{to appear}} is the {{unpaired}} retroperitoneal lymph sac {{at the root}} of the <b>mesentery</b> of the intestine. It develops from the primitive vena cava and mesonephric veins. Capillary plexuses and lymphatic vessels spread from the retroperitoneal lymph sac to the abdominal viscera and diaphragm. The sac establishes connections with the cisterna chyli but loses its connections with neighboring veins.|$|E
25|$|The spleen {{is unique}} in respect to its {{development}} within the gut. While most of the gut organs are endodermally derived (with {{the exception of the}} neural-crest derived adrenal gland), the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the dorsal <b>mesentery.</b> However, it still shares the same blood supply—the celiac trunk—as the foregut organs.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{parts of}} the GI tract are covered with serosa. These include most of the stomach, {{first part of the}} duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, {{transverse}} colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These {{parts of the}} tract have a <b>mesentery.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{systematics}} of Actiniidae {{is often}} quite difficult. The problem with identification of genera within this family {{is that most}} species are readily distinguishable when alive but when fixated lose their color and some other features. Arrangement of tentacles is important in defining genera for Actiniaria families. There may be one tentacle per space between <b>mesenteries</b> or {{there may be more}} than one tentacle between each two <b>mesenteries.</b> Members of the family Actiniidae have one tentacle per space.|$|R

40|$|The {{peritoneum}} is {{the largest}} and most complexly arranged serous membrane in the body. The potential peritoneal spaces, the peritoneal reflections forming peritoneal ligaments, <b>mesenteries,</b> omenta, and the natural flow of peritoneal fluid determine the route of spread of intraperitoneal fluid and consequently disease spread within the abdominal cavity. The peritoneal ligaments, <b>mesenteries,</b> and omenta also serve as boundaries and conduits for disease spread. Peritoneal metastases spread in four ways: v Direct spread along peritoneal ligaments, <b>mesenteries</b> and omenta to non-contiguous organs; v Intraperitoneal seeding via ascitic fluid; v Lymphatic extension; v Embolic haematogenous spread. Before the introduction of cross-sectional imaging, the peritoneum and its reflections could only be imaged with difficulty, often requiring invasive techniques. Computed tomography {{and to a lesser extent}} sonography and MR imaging allow us to examine the complex anatomy of the peritoneal cavity accurately, which is the key to understanding the spread of peritoneal metastases. This article reviews the detection of peritoneal metastases...|$|R
25|$|A volvulus is a twist {{along the}} axis of the <b>mesentery,</b> a torsion is a twist along the {{longitudinal}} axis of the intestine. Various parts of the horse's gastrointestinal tract may twist upon themselves. It {{is most likely to}} be either small intestine or part of the colon. Occlusion of the blood supply means that it is a painful condition causing rapid deterioration and requiring emergency surgery.|$|E
25|$|Gas distention usually {{produces}} mild clinical signs, but in {{some cases}} leads to severe signs due to pressure and tension on the <b>mesentery.</b> Simple obstructions often present with a slightly elevated heart rate (<60 bpm) but normal CRT and mucous membrane color. Strangulating obstructions are usually extremely painful, and the horse may have abdominal distention, congested mucous membranes, altered capillary refill time, and other signs of endotoxemia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mesentery</b> becomes {{attached}} to the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the mesenteric organ. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.|$|E
