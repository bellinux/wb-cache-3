5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp <b>might</b> <b>become</b> very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E

5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country. It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago's granitic high islands. Although it may be abundant, {{little is known about}} its biology. If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi <b>might</b> <b>become</b> endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{forecast}} {{called for the}} heat inversion to end that day, followed by a cold wind that would disperse the smog.

5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble <b>might</b> <b>become</b> flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked {{together}} closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron {{could be used to}} study biochemical processes, and <b>might</b> <b>become</b> a weapon in the fight against cancer.|$|E
5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they <b>might</b> <b>become</b> human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured <b>might</b> <b>become</b> slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak <b>might</b> <b>become</b> uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public <b>might</b> <b>become</b> worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they <b>might</b> <b>become</b> refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

5|$|During Lord Dunmore's War, {{a border}} {{conflict}} between colonists and American Indians, Isaac Shelby was commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} Virginia militia by Colonel William Preston. As second-in-command of his father's Fincastle County company, he {{took part in the}} decisive Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. The younger Shelby earned commendation for his skill and gallantry in this battle. The victorious militiamen erected Fort Blair {{on the site of the}} battle. They remained stationed there, with Shelby as second-in-command, until July 1775 when Lord Dunmore ordered the fort destroyed, fearing it <b>might</b> <b>become</b> useful to colonial rebels in the growing American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bonaparte became {{increasingly}} influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: {{one for the}} troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he <b>might</b> <b>become</b> a dictator. All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he <b>might</b> <b>become</b> a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department {{introduced him to the}} craft and textiles courses in the College of Home economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog. Henson would remain at WRC for seven years, from 1954 to 1961.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, £1 {{million of}} damage was caused {{to the pier}} by {{drifting}} equipment during engineering work in Sand Bay, {{to the north of}} the pier. The damage was quickly repaired, despite fears that Birnbeck <b>might</b> <b>become</b> like nearby Clevedon Pier, which at the time was severed by a collapsed span. The pier was again badly damaged by storms in 1990 and was closed for safety reasons in 1994. Daily trips during the summer months to and from Cardiff, Clevedon, and Penarth were suspended indefinitely. Due to the decline, English Heritage has placed it on the Heritage at Risk register. In 1999, the lifeboat station installed a walkway across the pier to allow them safe access to the island, at a cost of £20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Croatia {{launched}} several small-scale {{military operations}} against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and capture international attention; it was worried {{the situation on}} the ground <b>might</b> <b>become</b> permanent. In response, the RSK military retrieved their weapons from the UN/RSK-controlled storage sites, reversing the only major success of UNPROFOR. In March 1995, the UNPROFOR mission was terminated following the efforts of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke; the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation was deployed to Croatia with a new mandate. Later that year, most of the territory controlled by the RSK was captured by the HV during Operations Flash and Storm, which was foreseen by Babić when he opposed the Vance plan in 1991. The rest of the RSK-held areas were regained by Croatia following the Erdut Agreement negotiated between Croatian and Serbian authorities on 12 November 1995 during peace talks that also produced the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this <b>might</b> <b>become</b> necessary if {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E
