40|$|B. 1. 1 VIPRE {{modeling}} of PWR core with annular fuel: Optimization {{studies in the}} first year used an isolated channel and models for MDNBR analyses. These analyses provided sufficient knowledge of potential thermal hydraulic performance of annular fuels to select the 13 x 13 array as the most promising configuration. To obtain more realistic and accurate MDNBR, a whole core model is necessary. In particular, the major concern is correct representation of channel flow rate. The earlier models used the core-average mass flux, which does not account for flow rate reduction in the hot channels due to increased pressure drop in this channel as a result of higher subcooled, or possibly, saturated boiling. Therefore, it is expected that the MDNBR obtained from the full core VIPRE- 01 model will be smaller than the values obtained from the isolated channel <b>model.</b> <b>Progress</b> <b>Report</b> for Work August 2001 through July 200...|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} time in their lengthy history of relocations, the Naskapi were {{consulted}} in the planning of their new home. Indian and Northern Affairs sent officials to explain the new community to the Naskapi, a brochure was published, <b>models</b> built, and <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> issued. Particular interest among the Naskapi centred on the type of housing that they would receive. Possibly for financial reasons, Indian and Northern Affairs wanted them to live in row houses, whereas the Naskapi had a strong preference for detached, single-family residences. In the event, Council was persuaded to accept row housing, but it did so only on the condition that the houses were adequately sound-proofed, which turned out not to be the case.|$|R
