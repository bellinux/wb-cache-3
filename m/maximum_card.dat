5000|$|Mini-Magic is a {{constructed}} variant where decks {{are built}} with a <b>maximum</b> <b>card</b> limit of 15 {{and a maximum}} hand size of 3. Because of the small deck size, the state-based action causing a player to lose when they attempt to draw a card from their empty library is ignored. Select cards are banned in this format due to their heightened power level given the limited deck size. Alternatively, the format may be drafted using a single booster pack per person, {{this is known as}} Mini-Master or Pack Wars.|$|E

50|$|A <b>maximum</b> <b>card</b> (maxicard, maxi-card, MC) {{is made up}} {{of three}} elements: the postcard, the stamp and the postmark. The object of maximaphily is to obtain a card where the stamp and picture are in close concordance, ideally with an {{appropriate}} cancellation, too. If all three elements are concordant, then that card truly is a maximum concordance card (hence the name maximaphily). Preferably, the image on the postcard should not be simply an enlargement of the image on the stamp. There are exceptions. For example: a work of art, like a painting (not a detail of it), is often shown in its entirety, both on the postcard and on the stamp of the maxicard.|$|E

Once a player has exchanged three cards, no more cards are exchanged with that person. e.g. If the 8 position was +2 and the 5 position was +2, and the 3 position was - 4, then the 8 position would exchange two cards with the 3 position, and then the 5 position would only exchange one card. If {{there is more than one}} recipient of the exchange, the priority is reversed. e.g. If the 8 position was +4 and both the 5 and 3 positions were -2, then the 8 position would exchange one card with the 5 position and two cards with the 3 position.|$|R
