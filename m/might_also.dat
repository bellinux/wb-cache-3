5|$|American attitudes {{regarding}} government {{surveillance and}} privacy, constitutionally guaranteed rights to confront one's accuser in criminal prosecutions, and skepticism towards government power <b>might</b> <b>also</b> {{have a role}} in concerns about transportation safety in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia <b>might</b> <b>also</b> experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{researcher}} <b>might</b> <b>also</b> {{measure the}} organisation by {{its use of}} communication, transportation, size, and distribution of power relative to the population. (Russell 1938:130,132-134) Improved abilities to communicate and transport tend to stabilise larger organisations and disrupt smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators <b>might</b> <b>also</b> ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It <b>might</b> <b>also</b> include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, there <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats, {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, {{with each other and with}} humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and <b>might</b> <b>also</b> reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns <b>might</b> <b>also</b> {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E

5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually {{considered to have}} been buried with the ship (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. Alternatively, he <b>might</b> <b>also</b> have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E
5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the land on which he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville and the subsequent westward migration of Indians away from the Chicago area <b>might</b> <b>also</b> have influenced his decision.|$|E

5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug <b>might</b> <b>also</b> cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{prior to}} modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes <b>might</b> <b>also</b> influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd was {{concerned}} that German scientists <b>might</b> <b>also</b> attempt this experiment. The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the Belgian Congo was the best source of uranium ore. Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein might be a suitable person to do this, as he knew the Belgian Royal Family.|$|E

50|$|This protein {{transports}} primarily different glycosphingolipids and glyceroglycolipids between intracellular membranes, but not phospholipids.

5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which <b>might</b> <b>also</b> have been the ancestor of deer.|$|E
5|$|The {{main belt}} armour would {{normally}} taper {{to a lesser}} thickness {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; it <b>might</b> <b>also</b> taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck was typically lightly armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht built Justus {{a cathedral}} church in Rochester; the {{foundations}} of a nave and chancel partly underneath the present-day Rochester Cathedral may date from that time. What remains of {{the foundations of}} an early rectangular building near {{the southern part of}} the current cathedral <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be contemporary with Justus or may be part of a Roman building.|$|E

50|$|The duct {{widening}} {{is commonly}} {{believed to be}} a result of secretory stasis, including stagnant colostrum, which also causes periductal inflammation and fibrosis.
