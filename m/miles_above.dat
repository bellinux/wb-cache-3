However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae.

5|$|On June 5, {{just hours}} before Sullivan's arrival, Thompson sent 600 troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Arthur St. Clair toward Trois-Rivières with the goal of {{surprising}} and beating back the small British force believed to be there. Sullivan, on his arrival at Sorel, immediately dispatched Thompson with an additional 1,600 men to follow. These forces caught up with St. Clair at Nicolet, where defenses against troop movements on the river were erected the next day. On the night of June 7, Thompson, St. Clair, and about 2,000 men crossed the river, landing at Pointe du Lac, a few <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> Trois-Rivières.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 <b>miles)</b> <b>above</b> it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to}} cross the river effectively, and thus were unprepared. In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division was heavily engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The divisions' clashes centered on the town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On August 5, the North Koreans attacked, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. On August 6, the South Koreans launched a counteroffensive to retake the town. However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several <b>miles</b> <b>above</b> P'ohang-dong.

However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|E
