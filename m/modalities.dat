30|$|The {{study has}} {{compared}} {{the system of}} ORIENTATION of <b>modality</b> in English and Chinese. The two languages share the same strategy in explicit and implicit orientations. Specifically, <b>modality</b> could be realized by units of various rank levels. Explicit <b>modality</b> is construed as Figure. Quasi-explicit <b>modality</b> is construed as projecting Circumstance. Implicit <b>modality</b> is construed as modal Adjunct, part of Process/Predicator, or mood elements. One systemic difference between English and Chinese is that the word that realizes implicit <b>modality</b> is the finite (verbal operator) in English while the word in Chinese is the verbal adjunct (verbal auxiliary). This leads to another major difference: in English, the implicitly subjective <b>modality</b> is realized by the finite whereas in Chinese, {{there is no such}} grammatical resource. Hence {{there is no need to}} distinguish subjective/objective orientations in implicit <b>modality.</b> In fact, the choice of subjective and objective orientation is most obvious in explicit <b>modality</b> (not in quasi-explicit or implicit <b>modality)</b> in Chinese. Another difference is that at the group rank, verbal groups can be used to construe modal Adjunct in Chinese while this phenomenon is not found in English. Nonetheless, in both languages, moving up the rank scale from implicit to explicit <b>modality</b> means expanding the meaning potential of <b>modality.</b> Finally, the parallel corpus shows that translation shifts mostly occur in quasi-explicit <b>modality.</b> That is, the <b>modality</b> realized quasi-explicitly in English is more often represented explicitly in Chinese texts. It proves that the term ‘quasi-explicit’, as proposed in this study, captures the semantic nature of <b>modality</b> realized by units at phrase rank.|$|R

30|$|In Systemic Functional Grammar, <b>modality</b> {{is treated}} as a {{semantic}} domain that extends across more than one grammatical environment. The basic distinction that determines various realizations of <b>modality</b> is modeled as the system of ORIENTATION. This paper aims to compare the explicit/implicit manifestations of <b>modality</b> in English and Chinese, a relatively less discussed issue in previous literature. After introducing the system network of <b>modality</b> in SFG, the paper, based on the rank theory, posits that the explicit/implicit orientation could be mapped clearly onto the choices of three ranks: clause, phrase/group and word. A meaning-oriented criterion is set up as follows: (i) Explicit <b>modality</b> is construed as Figure/Proposition; (ii) Quasi-explicit <b>modality</b> is construed as projecting Circumstance; (iii) Implicit <b>modality</b> is construed as modal Adjunct, part of Process/Predicator or mood element. Provided this criterion, various realizations of <b>modality</b> are examined along the rank scale both in English and Chinese. It is found that the two languages share similar lexicogrammatical strategies in this respect. Some major differences are: (i) Verbal groups (e.g. shuō bú dìng ‘say NEG firm’) {{can be used to}} construe implicit <b>modality</b> in Chinese. This phenomenon is not found in English. (ii) In English, the choice of explicit and implicit <b>modality</b> parallels the choice of subjective and objective <b>modality.</b> In Chinese, however, the choice of subjective and objective <b>modality</b> is available only when explicit <b>modality</b> is opted. A small-scale analysis of how <b>modality</b> is translated in a parallel corpus shows preliminary evidence for the above observations.|$|R

5|$|Three main <b>modalities</b> of RRT are available: hemodialysis, {{continuous}} hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other <b>modalities.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a novel image search system, color-based image search by <b>modality</b> analysis. This system enables users to search images with <b>modality</b> words as query, like “romantic”, “quiet”, etc. <b>Modality</b> here is defined as {{emotions}} and conscious subjective aspect of feeling (interests, attitudes, opinions, etc). <b>Modality</b> presents richer semantics than emotions on human perception and understanding of images. We first propose seven <b>modality</b> dimensions to quantitatively analyze <b>modality.</b> A Chinese corpus containing 1200 <b>modality</b> words is constructed, in which each word is annotated with a seven-dimensional <b>modality</b> vector. Then three-color combinations are extracted from images as visual signatures by utilizing K-means clustering algorithm and CIE L*A*B * color space. To {{bridge the gap between}} <b>modality</b> (high-level semantic concepts) and three-color combinations (visual signatures), the prediction model for <b>modality</b> vectors is built up based on Kobayashi’s Color Image Scale by using the decision tree algorithm. Finally, we establish the image search system. Objective evaluations show the accuracy of the prediction model for <b>modality</b> vectors, while subjective evaluation results indicate that the extracted three-color combinations are in agreement with human perception and search results of our system are consistent with queries.

40|$|This study investigates <b>modality</b> markers used as {{expressions}} of politeness in British and American ambassadorial speeches via a corpus-based method. Results {{of the research}} reflect the semantic and pragmatic perspectives of <b>modality</b> markers on the theories of <b>modality</b> and politeness. Although <b>modality</b> and politeness are the central topics {{in a wide range}} of studies, the two domains have been discussed separately and their relationship has not been empirically investigated. Moreover, there has been no study on <b>modality</b> markers in British and American discourse, nor has the use of <b>modality</b> markers in British and American ambassadorial speeches been examined. Therefore, this research examines the relation of <b>modality</b> to politeness via the use of British and American ambassadorial speeches. The research contributes to the practice of the discourse community with the analysis of <b>modality</b> markers as politeness strategies in ambassadorial speeches. The results of a comparative analysis of <b>modality</b> markers as speakers’ politeness strategies collected in ambassadorial speeches reveal that American and British ambassadors are strikingly different in their frequency of <b>modality</b> markers expressing particular politeness categories. American ambassadors use more <b>modality</b> markers expressing positive politeness strategies such as paying attention to hearers, expressing strong commitment, hedging on hearers’ positive face, expressing optimism, complimenting to mitigate the force of comments, making claims and minimising the imposition of face-threatening acts. British ambassadors, however, employ more <b>modality</b> markers expressing negative politeness strategies such as hedging on negative face-threatening acts, expressing hypotheses, expressing humbleness and mitigating the force of obligation. Therefore, this thesis claims that American ambassadors use more <b>modality</b> markers expressing positive politeness in terms of personal emotions and directness, while British ambassadors prefer <b>modality</b> markers expressing negative politeness such as tentativeness, indirectness and mitigation. It is noted that <b>modality</b> is represented in a range of syntactic structures and patterns other than single modal auxiliary verbs. In addition, since <b>modality</b> markers as {{expressions of}} politeness are culture-specific, the use of <b>modality</b> markers differs from one culture to another. Moreover, <b>modality</b> markers cannot totally be treated as hedges in intercultural communication since some <b>modality</b> markers which seem to be semantically similar between languages are actually different in their pragmatic functions among different cultures...|$|R

This study aims to identify the level of assertiveness of arguments in debating. The study employed mainly a qualitative method focusing on text analysis and involved a debating activity of senior high school students. World School Debating Championship style, Hallidayan’s mood and <b>modality</b> analysis, and the theory of assertiveness in verbal communication became the basis of the analysis. seven phenomena were analyzed in this study including mood type, mood adjunct (conjunctive adjunct), mood metaphor, <b>modality</b> type, <b>modality</b> value, orientation and manifestation of <b>modality,</b> and <b>modality</b> metaphor. This study reveals that the level of assertiveness in argumentation is measured through the total number of declarative mood, conjunctive adjunct, high value of <b>modality,</b> explicit subjective <b>modality,</b> and explicit subjective <b>modality</b> metaphor. The study also shows that the level of assertiveness relatively depends on how the students deliver their arguments. Therefore, the students might need a variety of ways in order to make their argument sound more assertive.   Keywords: argument, assertiveness, debate, mood, mood metaphor, <b>modality,</b> <b>modality</b> metaphor, senior highschool, systemic functional   Abstrak: Artikel ini melaporkan sebuah penelitian tentang analisis asertivitas dari argumen siswa yang tergabung dalam kelompok debat di sebuah Sekolah Menengah Atasswasta.

40|$|<b>Modality</b> and negation, as two {{important}} linguistic features {{used to realise}} subjectivity, have been investigated within various disciplines, such as logic, linguistics and philosophy, and law. The interaction between <b>modality</b> and negation, as a relatively new and undeveloped domain, has however not been paid due attention in scholarship. This corpus-based study investigates three aspects of their interaction: the differentiation of the deontic value by negation, the categorization of deontic <b>modality</b> in Hong Kong legislation via negation, and distribution patterns of deontic <b>modality,</b> especially distribution patterns of the negation of <b>modality,</b> in Hong Kong legislation.
