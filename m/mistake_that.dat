5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee with both hands. He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, walked over to Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E

5|$|After {{making a}} <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> led to York conceding a goal late on in a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was {{replaced}} in the line-up by McGurk {{for the next}} match at home to Lincoln three days later. This {{was the start of}} a second extended spell out of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 3–5–2 formation for York's FA Trophy first-round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 3–0. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 4–3–3 formation. With York reverting to 3–5–2 for a 1–1 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 2–0. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2007, Robinson made a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> {{resulted}} in Germany scoring their first {{goal of the}} match. England lost the match 2–1 for their first loss at the new Wembley Stadium. He was substituted at half-time and replaced by David James, although then England manager Steve McClaren {{said he planned to}} make this substitution before the match. Despite this error, Robinson was still the number one goalkeeper, featuring in four further European Championship qualifiers, and keeping a clean sheet in three of them. He made another mistake, however, in a 2–1 defeat against Russia: Robinson palmed a shot into the path of Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko's path, resulting in the striker scoring Russia's winning goal. As a result, McClaren dropped Robinson for the final qualifying match against Croatia in November, replacing him with Scott Carson. England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals as they lost 3–2 in their final match against Croatia; Carson made an error from a Niko Kranjčar shot for the first goal.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E
