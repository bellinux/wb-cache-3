5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

40|$|This study employs {{psychological}} type {{theory to}} profile those individuals {{drawn to the}} Grange retreat house at Ampleforth Abbey {{in the heart of}} rural Yorkshire. Data provided by 361 men and women who completed the Francis Psychological Type Scales demonstrated that, compared with the profile of the United Kingdom population as a whole, the Abbey appeals <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to introverts <b>than</b> to extraverts, <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to intuitives <b>than</b> to sensers, <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to feelers <b>than</b> to thinkers, and <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to judgers <b>than</b> to perceivers. These findings are interpreted in light of the strengths of Benedictine spirituality, and challenges and opportunities are highlighted for Christian leaders and educators...|$|R

25|$|Economic {{activity}} has rebounded across Africa. However, {{the pace of}} recovery was uneven among groups of countries and subregions. Oil-exporting countries generally expanded <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> oil-importing countries. West Africa and East Africa were the two best-performing subregions in 2010.|$|E
25|$|These {{findings}} suggest that two processes affect the reminiscence bump phenomenon: (1) Events in adolescence are encoded <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> events that occur in other periods of life. (2) Because these events are initially stored more intensely, they will be retrieved more frequently.|$|E
25|$|In interwar period, Hungary {{expanded}} its university system so the administrators could be produced {{to carry out}} the Magyarization of the lost territories for the case they were regained.

25|$|The {{separation}} of colours by a prism {{is an example}} of normal dispersion. At the surfaces of the prism, Snell's law predicts that light incident at an angle θ to the normal will be refracted at an angle arcsin(sin (θ) / n). Thus, blue light, with its higher refractive index, is bent <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> red light, resulting in the well-known rainbow pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} and reactivity of a person's negative affectivity, or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> does childhood sexual abuse. This finding, differences in brain structure (see Brain abnormalities), {{and the fact}} that some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history, suggest that BPD is distinct from the post-traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it. Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma.|$|E
25|$|Though their {{experimental}} endeavors {{received some}} press coverage, their real breakthrough {{came with the}} 1999 release, The Soft Bulletin. Marrying more traditional catchy melodies with synthetic strings, hypnotic, carefully manipulated beats, booming cymbals and oddball but philosophical lyrics (sung much <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> on earlier releases), the album quickly {{became one of the}} underground hits of the year, even widely considered {{to be one of the}} best albums of the entire decade.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{has helped}} in separating genera within the Meliphagidae family into four main clades which show relationships between species, though a shortage in sampling and statistics {{has led to}} some branches within the clades being <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> linked <b>than</b> others.|$|R
50|$|Co-citation Proximity Analysis was {{conceived}} by B. Gipp in 2006 and {{the description of}} the document similarity measure was later published by Gipp and Beel in 2009. The similarity measure rests on the assumption that within a document’s full-text, the documents cited in close proximity to each other tend to be <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> related <b>than</b> those documents cited farther apart. The figure to the right illustrates the concept. The CPA approach to document similarity assumes the documents B and C to be <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> related <b>than</b> the documents B and A, because the citations to B and C occur within the same sentence, whereas the citations to B and A are separated by several paragraphs.|$|R
5000|$|Pointers are {{implemented}} {{very much as}} in Pascal, as are [...] parameters in procedure calls. Modula-2 is even <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> typed <b>than</b> Pascal, with fewer ways to escape the type system. Some of the variants of Modula-2 (such as Modula-3) include garbage collection.|$|R
25|$|In {{a written}} statement, Geithner said that China is {{manipulating}} the Renminbi by purposefully keeping its value low {{in order to}} make its exported products seem cheaper on the world market. If confirmed, Geither said to the Senate Finance Committee that he would ask the Obama administration to pressure China diplomatically to change this practice, <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> the Bush administration did. The United States maintains that China's actions hurt American businesses and contributed to the financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{elephant seal}} is distinguished from the northern elephant seal (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> the northern species. This seal shows extreme sexual dimorphism in size, seemingly the largest of any mammal by mass, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the people}} who were born in Karelia and were {{evacuated}} want Karelia to become part of Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the Cold War. Former President Mauno Koivisto has been against a discussion about the question. Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor nationalist right-wing groups.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} E. s. triglites of the Bergamo Alps and Monte Generoso is <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> marked <b>than</b> the nominate subspecies E. s. styx.

25|$|Amorphous silicon is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).|$|E
25|$|High {{first entered}} {{the race for}} {{governor}} in 1964. He {{announced that he would}} refuse to accept large campaign donations, and traveled the state in a DC-3. The Miami News was the only newspaper in the state to endorse High. Until his candidacy, Democratic candidates for Governor of Florida had supported segregation, some <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> others. The Democratic-dominated legislature {{at the turn of the}} century had passed a new constitution that disenfranchised most blacks, a status that was enforced until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|E
25|$|About 1.7 {{million people}} commute to work across a European border each day, {{and in some}} regions these people {{constitute}} up {{to a third of}} the workforce. For example, 2.1% of the workers in Hungary work in another country, primarily Austria and Slovakia. Each year, there are 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings are due to transport of goods by road, with a value of €2.8 trillion each year. The trade in goods is affected <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>than</b> trade in services, and the decrease in the cost of trade varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors.|$|E
