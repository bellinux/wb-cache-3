40|$|Worldwide {{consumption}} of cheese has {{increased over the}} years. The average Swede consumes somewhere around 20 kilograms of cheese per year, which is an increase of a 100 % over the past 50 years. One {{of the most popular}} kinds of cheese during the past decades is mozzarella, due to its’ use as pizza cheese. Flavor and consistency differ between the traditional kind, made out of buffalo’s milk, and the industrially made kind, made out of cow’s milk. Both the techniques as well as the kinds of milk used have a huge impact on the final product. The authors had access to fresh <b>ewe’s</b> (sheep’s) <b>milk</b> from a local farmer. Could it be used to produce a new type of mozzarella? The main purpose of this paper was to develop a technique to produce fresh hand-made mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> using starter bacteria. The second purpose was to perform a sensory evaluation of the produced cheese in order to compare cheese made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> with cheese made out of cow’s milk. In a series of experiments we examined how cheese production was affected by rennet, starter cultures, temperatures and pH-levels. The sensory evaluation was performed using a group of respondents who were asked to perform a simple ranking test where one sample was mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk,</b> one sample was mozzarella made out of cow’s milk and one sample was store-bought mozzarella made out of cow’s <b>milk.</b> <b>Ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> turned out to be unsuitable for production of mozzarella using the procedure we developed. The proteins in <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> behaved differently from the proteins in cow’s milk when the cheese curd was stretched in hot water, resulting in a less stringy and more porous texture. The most suitable bacterial starter was a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, both of which you find in yoghurt. Results from the sensory evaluation showed that the respondents preferred the fresh mozzarella made out of cow’s milk. The method that we developed did not produce the desired texture in mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk.</b> However, it is well adjusted for the production of mozzarella made out of cow’s milk.

40|$|In {{spite of}} being a {{favourable}} product regarding its feeding value, <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> cannot be compared by its production volume with either cow or goat milk. Because it is rich in fats, proteins and minerals <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> belongs to an outstanding valuable human food (Antunović et al., 2001). It is known that the <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> content can vary due to {{various factors such as}} lactation stage, feeding, breed, season of the year, etc. (Jelinek et al., 1993). In general, <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> contains very low concentrations of heavy metals. Accelerated industrial and agricultural develop-ment considerably affects environmental emis-sions of selected toxic elements: cadmium, lead, mercury and arsenic (Lopez et al., 2002). Their concentrations in animal organisms and their milk concentrations may increase very fast, although their excretion through milk is very low (Miller, 1971; Houpert et al., 1997). Their ecosystem ac-cumulation (water-soil-plant-animal) makes them very toxic and leads to undesirable consequences for live organisms (Bogut et al., 2000; Piskorova et al., 2003). Free-living animals are important indi-cators of the environmental pollution with heavy metals (Kottferová and Koréneková, 1998). Sheep and cattle reared freely on pasture are also indica-tors of the environmental pollution (Gallo et al., 1996). Increased concentrations of heavy metals in the body of domestic animals result in low fitness of animals and reproduction problems as well as in immunity decline and occurrence of cancerous and teratogenic diseases (Bires et al., 1995).

In a sheep farm, two groups of <b>milking</b> <b>ewes</b> with identical genetic material, management, nutrition, health status and similar production characteristics were formed. One group (46 ewes) served as control, while the other one (48 ewes) served as a probiotic-treated group. Both groups of ewes received a similar feeding regiment, but the ewes of the second group were additionally offered a probiotic product containing B. licheniformis and B. subtilis (BioPlus 2 B, Chr. Hansen, Denmark) at the approximate dose of 2. 56 x 10 (9) viable spores per ewe per day. Lamb mortality during the 1. 5 months suckling period, and milk yield during the 2 months of milk collection for commercial purposes have been recorded. In the non-treated control group, 13. 1 % mortality was observed versus 7. 8 % in the probiotic-treated group (P = 0. 33), with mortality being mainly due to diarrhoea. Microbiological examination of diarrhoeic faeces from some of the dead lambs in both groups revealed the presence of Escherichia coli.

Horese are less able in this compensation than ruminants. The experiments on dairy ews compared 2, 4, and 6 h/d time access to pasture.
