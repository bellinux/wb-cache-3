40|$|Surface-tension gradients, {{which can}} exist across autocatalytic {{chemical}} fronts propagating in thin layers of solution {{in contact with}} air, can induce capillary flows that are also called Marangoni flows. These flows in turn affect the spatio-temporal evolution of the concentration fields. This paper addresses {{the influence of the}} thickness of the solution layer on the chemo-hydrodynamic pattern resulting from such a coupling between autocatalytic reactions, diffusion and <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects,</b> neglecting any buoyancy-driven effect. The system reaches an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a steady fluid vortex traveling at a constant speed with the front and deforming it. When the thickness of the fluid layer is increased, <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> are increasing, thus leading to a larger deformation of the chemical front, larger traveling speed, and more intense convection. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

The reduced gravity environment gives an unique opportunity to explore th role of <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> on the boiling mechanisms free of gravitational body forces that obscure the role of such effects. However, recent experimental results suggest that under reduced gravity conditions, <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> is the dominant mechanism of vapor-liquid exchange at the surface for some binary mixture. To further explore such effects, experiments have been conducted with water/ 2 -propanol mixtures at three different concentrations under normal gravity with different orientations of the heater surface and under reduce gravity aboard the DC- 9 aircraft at NASA Lewis Research Center. The system pressure was sub atmospheric (approx. 8 kP at 1 g(n)) and the bulk liquid temperature varied from low subcooling to near saturation. The molar concentrations of 2 -propanol tested were 0. 015, 0. 025, and 0. 1. Boiling curves were obtained both for high gravity (approx. 2 g(n)) and reduce gravity (approx. 0. 01 g(n)). For each concentration of 2 -propanol, the critical heat flux has been determined in the flight experiments only for reduced gravity conditions. Comparison of boiling curves and CHF obtained under l-g(n) an reduced gravity indicates that boiling mechanism in this mixtures is nearly independent of gravity. The results also indicate that the Marangoni mechanism is strong enough in these mixtures to sustain the boiling under reduced gravity conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} numerical analysis {{has been carried}} out to study <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> during the evaporation of droplets. The experiments are performed with pendant drops of silicone oils (with different viscosities) and hydrocarbons. The temperature of the disk sustaining the drop is rapidly increased or decreased in order to study transient heating or cooling processes. The velocity field in the droplet is evaluated monitoring the motion of tracers in the meridian plane, using a laser sheet illumination system and a video camera. Surface temperature distributions of the drops are detected by infrared thermocamera. The numerical model is based on axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations, taking into account the presence of Marangoni shear stresses and evaporative cooling at the liquid-air interface. Marangoni flows cause a larger, more uniform surface temperature, increasing heat transfer from disk to droplet, as well as evaporation rate. When <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> are negligible, larger surface temperature differences occur along the drop surface and heat transfer is relatively small. The role of Marangoni and buoyancy flows in silicone oils with different viscosities and hydrocarbons is discussed and correlations are presented between experimental and numerical results.

50|$|Also, surface {{stretching}} {{makes the}} surface {{tension of the}} indented spot greater than the surrounding area. Consequentially—since diffusion time for the surfactants is large—the <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect</b> has time to take place. The difference in surface tension creates a gradient, which instigates fluid flow from areas of lower surface tension to areas of higher surface tension. The second picture shows the film at equilibrium after the <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect</b> has taken place.|$|E

50|$|Under earth conditions, {{the effect}} of gravity causing density-driven {{convection}} in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect.</b> Many experiments (ESA MASER 1-3) have been conducted under microgravity conditions aboard sounding rockets to observe the <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect</b> without the influence of gravity. Research on heat pipes performed on the International Space Station revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate {{at one end and}} migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid. This is due to the very weak <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect</b> within a mixture of almost identical surface tensions which is normally masked by the fluid's inertia due to gravity.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} our derivations of analytical expressions for {{the frequencies}} and damping constants for small-amplitude axisymmetric shape oscillations of a liquid drop suspended in an immiscible fluid host in microgravity. In particular, this work addresses large Reynolds number shape oscillations {{and focuses on}} the surface rheological effects that arise from the presence of insoluble surfactants at the interface. Parameters characterizing viscous effects from the bulk phases, surface viscous <b>effects,</b> <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> from the surface advection and diffusion of surfactants, and the Gibbs elasticity are all considered and analyzed to determine {{the relative importance of}} each contribution. Supplementing the analytical treatment for small-amplitude oscillations, a numerical boundary integral equation formulation is developed for the study of large-amplittide axisymmetric oscillations of a drop in vacuum. The boundary integral formulation is an extension of classical potential flow theory and approximately accounts for viscous effects in the bulk fluid as well as the surface viscous and <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effects</b> resulting from an insoluble surfactant contaminating the interface. Theoretical and numerical results are presented for four distinct cases. These, range from the case when the effects of the surfactants are 'negligible' to 'large' when compared to the viscous effects in the bulk phases.

40|$|When a {{horizontal}} resistive wire is heated {{up to the}} boiling point in a subcooled liquid bath, some vapor bubbles nucleate on its surface. Traditional nucleate boiling theory predicts that bubbles generated from active nucleate sites, grow up and depart from the heating surface due to buoyancy and inertia. However, we observed here a different behavior: the bubbles slide along the heated wire. In this situation, unexpected regimes are observed; from the simple sliding motion to bubble clustering. We noticed that bubbles could rapidly change their moving direction and may also interact.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that motion at a {{liquid-liquid}} interface may be generated by the transfer of matter. The constraint is the difference in concentration profiles between both bulk phases. In the same way, surface-chemical, sorption or electrochemical reactions may also induce convection. The constraint in this case is related to the non-equilibrium kinetic steps. A general theory based on a linear analysis of stability shows the role of mechanical (density, viscosity, interfacial tension, surface elasticity), chemical (kinetic constants, composition) or electrochemical (electrical field, dielectric constant) parameters in the onset of interfacial deformations and movements.

50|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} the <b>Marangoni</b> <b>effect</b> is the use for drying silicon wafers after a wet processing step during the manufacture of integrated circuits.
