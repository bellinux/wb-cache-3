5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> liquid hydrogen fluoride.

5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent <b>mixture,</b> <b>with</b> no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia <b>mixture</b> <b>with</b> a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E
