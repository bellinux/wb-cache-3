5|$|After the British {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove {{was established}} in 1788, {{a significant part of}} the Chinese porcelain shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India. Operating under licences issued by the British East India Company, who held a commercial <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> the Far East, this trade was known as the 'Country Trade', the Indian ships were called 'Country Ships' and their captains 'Country Captains'. Examination of the cargo of ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies, including Chinese porcelain traded via India often in Indian-built vessels, to the early Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

40|$|With July 1, 1994 as a deadline, the European Union {{deregulated}} {{the property}} liability markets {{to a great}} extent. This led to the abolishment of twelve regional <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> property liability insurance in Germany. In Switzerland as well efforts are being made to deregulate the existing 19 cantonal <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> fire insurance {{in an attempt to}} follow the EU lead. This paper examines the possible outcome of an abolishment of the cantonal monopolies on the Swiss property liability insurance market, taking an indirect approach. It is based on a comparison of premium payments <b>in</b> the German <b>monopoly</b> regions on the one hand, and premium payments of private insurers on the other. For the period 1980 to 1994, mark-up on damage payments proved to be lower by 21 percentage points <b>in</b> the <b>monopoly</b> regions. This result is in line with a corresponding analysis of the Swiss property liability insurance market covering the period from 1984 to 1994 : the cantonal <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland have a mark-up on damage payments that is 47 percentage points lower than the mark-up of their private counterparts. In conclusion, the comparison of monopolies and firms operating in a free market environment points to the fact that a deregulation of the Swiss <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> property liability insurance would very likely result in higher premiums. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{consolidated}} all of {{the offices}} for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA). The entire concentration camp system was placed {{under the authority of}} the WVHA. The SS owned Sudetenquell GbmH, a mineral water producer in Sudetenland. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired a <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 94% {{of urban}} Sarawak was {{supplied}} with electricity, but only 67% of rural areas had electricity. However, this had increased to 91% by 2014. According to a 2015 article, household internet penetration in Sarawak {{was lower than}} Malaysian national average, 41.2% versus 58.6%, with 58.5% of internet use being in urban areas and 29.9% in rural areas. In comparison, mobile telecommunication uptake in Sarawak was comparable to the national average, 93.3% against a national average of 94.2%, and on par with neighbouring Sabah. Mobile telecommunication infrastructure, specifically broadcast towers, are built and managed by SacofaSdnBhd (Sacofa Private Limited), which enjoys a <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> Sarawak after the company was granted a 20-year exclusivity deal on the provision, maintenance and leasing of towers in the state.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E

This arrangement gave the Catholic missionaries freedom and <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> elephant export to the Portuguese, which the incumbent king however resisted.

5|$|Tipu Sultan is {{credited}} to have founded state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom.

During Tipu's rule French technology {{was used for}} the first time in carpentry and smithy, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an {{internal}} <b>monopoly</b> <b>in</b> the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations {{but it was}} adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City {{in the west to}} Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more.

5000|$|During the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, Chinese scholar-officials {{would often}} {{debate about the}} {{interference}} the government should have in the economy, such as setting <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> lucrative industries and instating price controls.

During the Han and Tang, emperors sometimes instated government <b>monopolies</b> <b>in</b> times of war, and abolished them later when the fiscal crisis had passed. Eventually, in the later Song and Ming dynasties, state <b>monopolies</b> were abolished <b>in</b> every industry and were never reinstated during the length of that dynasty, with the government following laissez-faire policies. During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, state monopolies were reinstated, and the government interfered heavily in the economy; many scholars believe this prevented China from developing capitalism.|$|R
