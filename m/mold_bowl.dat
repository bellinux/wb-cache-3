5000|$|Rugby {{league and}} cricket matches were also featured, and when A.D. Thomas, who styled himself [...] "the picture king, {{the mastermind of}} the world", heard of a cricketing scandal where the {{respected}} Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold was repeatedly no-balled by the umpire, Jim Phillips, he promptly commissioned a filmed re-enactment of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling</b> to prove that his technique was valid - the first action replay, which was a popular success.|$|R
500|$|That December, {{at their}} annual meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground, the captains of the {{first-class}} counties discussed {{the problem of}} throwing. MacLaren asked those present at the meeting to give their opinion of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling.</b> According to MacLaren, they [...] "replied to a man that they considered that Mold was not always fair". Reports in the press stated that they voted {{by a majority of}} eleven to one that Mold's action was unfair, and that along with other bowlers whose actions were suspected, he should not bowl in the coming season. The captains further recommended that bowlers with illegal actions should be banned, suspended or warned depending on the severity of their transgression. The meeting proved controversial, and disputes arose over how many captains had supported the decision. MacLaren claimed that he was the only captain to support Mold. Despite the verdict of the meeting, Lancashire's committee remained of the opinion that <b>Mold</b> <b>bowled</b> legally; the Lancashire president A. N. Hornby and several of Mold's team-mates also publicly backed the bowler. Opinions among other players and in the press varied as to the fairness of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling,</b> but sympathy was expressed for the damage to Mold's career and reputation, while Pelham Warner suggested that it was unfair to ban Mold completely. Some critics believed that the captains should not have passed judgement at all. The MCC, responsible for the laws of cricket and the organisation of the English game, were asked to adjudicate by several county committees. Reluctant to let the decision stand, the MCC overruled the captains, preferring to leave the matter to individual umpires. However, the umpires were instructed to pay close attention to suspect bowlers during the coming season.|$|R
500|$|Although he {{may have}} been {{expected}} to retire following the controversy and in view of his age, Mold continued to play for Lancashire, who were short of quality bowlers, {{at the start of the}} 1901 season. At least one umpire was asked by the MCC to report specifically on <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling,</b> but decided it was fair, and no umpire initially called him for throwing. He missed two Lancashire matches in which Phillips was an umpire, wishing to avoid a confrontation, but Lancashire were criticised by the public for omitting Mold from these matches. Consequently, he played in the game against Somerset umpired by Phillips, which started on 11 July at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Under the captaincy of MacLaren, Mold opened the attack and bowled with Phillips at square leg. In Mold's second over of the game, Phillips no-balled him for throwing. Acting at the request of the Lancashire committee, MacLaren then switched <b>Mold</b> to <b>bowl</b> from the opposite end so that Phillips would be at the bowler's end. Even so, Phillips continued to no-ball him, and after 10 overs, Mold had been called 16 times by Phillips. MacLaren removed Mold from the attack, although he returned to bowl later without further action from either umpire. For the remainder of the match, <b>Mold</b> <b>bowled</b> from Phillips' end without censure; Phillips believed he had made his point. The other umpire took no action at any point in the match. The crowd at the game protested noisily against Phillips, for a time shouting [...] "no-ball" [...] as every ball was bowled, and making comments about him. According to Wisden, Phillips' actions caused [...] "a great sensation... The incident naturally gave rise to much excitement, and for the next few days nothing else was talked about in the cricket world." [...] At the conclusion of the match, Mitchell and Kenyon, a film-making company based in Blackburn, filmed the players leaving the field and took footage of <b>Mold</b> <b>bowling</b> in the nets. Phillips received criticism for his actions and Mold had some support in the press. Mold's Times obituary noted: [...] "Mold did not lack defenders, but those who argued that he was, and always had been, a perfectly fair bowler, had a very bad case. The weight of expert evidence was overwhelmingly against them." ...|$|R
500|$|Opinion {{was divided}} over the {{legality}} of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling</b> action. After no-balling Mold for the second time, Phillips wrote that he had long suspected Mold of throwing. Even though he believed Mold was trying to bowl with a straight arm in the Somerset match, Phillips considered many more deliveries to be throws than merely those he called. In his own defence, Mold queried why Phillips never acted on his prior suspicions, and suggested that the umpire {{did not make it}} clear which part of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling</b> action was unfair. The Manchester Guardian, reporting on the Somerset match in 1901, noted that many umpires had apparently viewed Mold's action as fair earlier in the season, even after the instruction from the MCC to pay careful attention to him. It stated that [...] "the general opinion was that if one ball was to be called a throw then every ball he sent down was of the same order." [...] However, some critics noted that when bowling an occasional faster ball, Mold's action changed slightly; this was the delivery to which Phillips objected. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that the lack of action by umpires other than Phillips in 1901, and throughout Mold's career, meant that the [...] "charge against Mold, then, can hardly be said to have been 'proven.|$|R

5|$|Mold {{began his}} {{professional}} cricket career playing for Banbury and Northamptonshire in the mid-1880s, but by 1889 had qualified {{to play for}} Lancashire at county level. Immediately successful, he quickly established a good bowling partnership with Johnny Briggs {{and became one of}} the leading bowlers in the country. However, he only achieved selection for England in one series in 1893. Many critics thought he threw rather than bowled the ball, and he was among several bowlers at the time about whom there were similar suspicions. Controversy erupted in 1900 when Mold was no-balled for throwing by Jim Phillips, an umpire who had targeted several prominent bowlers with dubious <b>bowling</b> actions. After <b>Mold</b> avoided several games in which Phillips was umpire, the affair came to a head in 1901. On the opening morning of a match, Phillips repeatedly no-balled Mold. Several of Mold's team-mates and most Lancashire supporters continued to believe that <b>Mold</b> <b>bowled</b> legally, but his reputation was ruined and, after three more appearances in 1901, he retired {{at the end of the}} season.

500|$|A fast bowler who {{operated}} from a {{very short}} run-up, <b>Mold</b> <b>bowled</b> extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through seam movement or cutting his fingers over it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that {{he was among the}} fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was [...] "beautiful" [...] and possessed [...] "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: [...] "On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [...] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." [...] The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.|$|R
500|$|In 1892, Mold's {{aggregate}} of wickets fell to 120 at {{an average}} of 13.63, but he returned the best bowling figures of his career when he took nine for 29 against Kent. He was chosen in a representative match for the first time, playing for the North against the South. During the 1893 season, Mold took 166 wickets at 16.96; {{at the end of the}} season, The Times described him as a great bowler and noted that he and Johnny Briggs were Lancashire's only two effective bowlers. Between them, the pair took 225 wickets; the other bowlers in combination took 46. Once more representing the North during 1893, this time in a match against the touring Australian team, Mold also made his debut in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match, playing for the professional [...] "Players" [...] and taking nine wickets in the game. His performances brought about his international debut; he played for England in all three Test matches against Australia, the only such appearances of his career. In the first game, he took three for 44 in Australia's only innings, his best figures of the series, and took four wickets in the other two matches to finish with seven wickets {{at an average}} of 33.42. It is likely that doubts about the legality of his bowling action prevented him from playing further Test matches, or touring Australia with a representative side. However, other factors may have played a part in his subsequent omission, including the emergence of Tom Richardson as a successful fast bowler, and the opinion that <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling</b> was flattered by the difficult, uneven pitches on which Lancashire played their home games.|$|R

5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of <b>Mold's</b> <b>bowling</b> action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} {{excavations}} in 1984, 1986, and 1988 found remains of domestic architecture and materials, including an enclosure wall that had bordered {{much of the}} site. From these excavations came artifacts like bread <b>molds</b> and <b>bowls</b> {{that could be used}} for food storage, but the lack of basic items and the means to produce them suggests Kom el-Hisn was a religious settlement or ran under a governmental authority. During Robert J. Wenke’s excavation in 1988, he uncovered broken sealings and ceramics dating to the 5th and 6th dynasties. The site appears to have been a settlement occupied at least to the Middle Kingdom. Though the lack of basic domestic goods gives evidence to Kom el-Hisn being occupied by the Hathor cult and a small support staff for those priests. This is again supported by Wenke’s excavation in 1988, where stone tools were found but leftovers from their manufacture were rare. So far, no manufacturing workshops or evidence of such has been found, but Wenke stresses that it is still possible they existed but were removed from the main site.|$|R

Three-dimensional hanji art is similar to paper mache, in that it can make sculptural objects that may stand unsupported. Traditional hanji craft forms include jiho, jido, and jiseung. Jiho is a method that uses hanji scraps soaked in water and then added to glue, making a clay-like paste that can be <b>molded</b> into lidded <b>bowls.</b> Jido is the craft of pasting many layers of hanji onto a pre-made frame, which can be made into sewing baskets and trunks. Ancient Koreans commonly put their sewing materials in small boxes decorated with colorful Hanji (“Hanji Crafting”). Jiseung is a method of cording and weaving strips of hanji to make {{a wide array of}} household goods, including trays, baskets, mats, quivers, shoes, washbasins, and chamberpots. Other than these, Hanji was made into various flowers to decorate Buddhist temples (“Hanji Crafting”).|$|R
