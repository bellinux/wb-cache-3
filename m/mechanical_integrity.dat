25|$|Because {{a breast}} implant is a Class III medical device of limited product-life, the {{principal}} rupture-rate factors are its age and design; Nonetheless, a breast implant device can retain its <b>mechanical</b> <b>integrity</b> for decades in a woman's body. When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, {{and thus can}} be readily explanted (surgically removed). The follow-up report, Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the <b>mechanical</b> <b>integrity</b> of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a series}} of single wall carbon {{nanotube}} (SWNT) polyimide nanocomposites were de-veloped since the demand of electroactive polymeric materials as sensors and actuators for use in high temperature applications has been growing. Adding SWNTs into electroactive polyimides enhanced their electrostrictive strain {{as well as their}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>integrities</b> and chemical stabil-ity. Although an increase in piezoelectricity resulting from the incorporation of SWNTs could be expected, there has been no systematic study detailing the effect of SWNTs on piezoelectricity. In this article, the effects of various types and concentrations of SWNT on the dipole orientation and piezoelectricity were investigated using a thermally stimulated current (TSC) technique and a modified Rheovibron. It was found that the barely modified SWNTs led to a more substantial increase in the remanent polarization (Pr) than the highly modified SWNTs did. As the loading level of SWNTs increased, Pr increased. However, excessive loading of SWNTs showed a reduc-tion in Pr since the actual poling field decreased due to a large leakage of current. The trend of the piezoelectric strain coefficient, d 31, was consistent with that of Pr. The increase in interfacial polarization caused by adding SWNT was believed to be primarily responsible for the increase of Pr and d 31...|$|R

Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration.

25|$|In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued an}} {{emergency}} order against Range Resources, {{stating that the}} company's drilling activities in Parker County, Texas had contaminated at least two residential drinking water wells. The company denied the allegations, and said the presence of methane {{was a result of}} naturally occurring migration, and had shown up in nearby water wells long before Range drilled its gas wells. However, after a January 2011 Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) hearing, TRRC staff concluded that, based on chemical composition, the gas in the water wells came from the shallow Strawn Formation, rather than the deeper Barnett Shale, in which the Range wells were completed. They also concluded that pressure tests by Range showed <b>mechanical</b> <b>integrity</b> of the casing. EPA and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the TRRC hearing, but did not.
