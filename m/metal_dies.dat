All dentures were completely waxed using a same thickness of base plate wax and teeth were made for the purpose of accuracy.

After silicone injection between each denture and <b>metal</b> <b>die</b> was performed, weighing the elastomeric silicone layer was performed to study adaptation of dentures. <b>Metal</b> <b>die</b> was used both before copying the casts and   after storing them in water for two months.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{discusses the}} influence of material of foundry mould {{on the effect of}} modification of AlSi 11 alloy. For this purpose castings were produced in moulds made of four various materials. Castings of the first type were cast in a <b>metal</b> <b>die,</b> the second ones in the conventional mould of bentonite-bound sand, those of the third type in the sand mould with oil binder, the last ones in a shell mould where phenol-formaldehyde resin was applied as a binder. All the castings were made of AlSi 11 alloy modified with strontium. For a purpose of comparison also castings made of the non-modified alloy were produced. The castings were examined with regard to their microstructures. The performed investigations point out that the addition of strontium master alloy results in refining of the alloy structure, particularly of the α-phase, causes some morphological changes in the alloy and the refinement of eutectics. The advantageous influence of modifier on the structure of the examined silumin was observed particularly in the case of alloy cast either in the conventional oil-bound sand mould or in the shell mould. The non-modified alloy cast into a <b>metal</b> <b>die</b> exhibits a structure similar to those of modified alloy solidifying in the other moulds.
