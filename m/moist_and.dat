5|$|Lemurs {{also have}} a third eyelid known as a nictitating membrane, whereas most other {{primates}} have a lesser developed plica semilunaris. The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> clean by sweeping across the eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{country is}} mostly savannah, {{although}} the <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> mountainous eastern highlands support areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees found in these Eastern Highlands include teak, mahogany, enormous specimens of strangling fig, forest newtonia, big leaf, white stinkwood, chirinda stinkwood, knobthorn and many others.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in a <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E

50|$|Funaria hygrometrica, {{the bonfire}} moss or common cord-moss, {{is a type}} of water moss which grows on <b>moist,</b> shady, <b>and</b> damp soil. It can also be found on <b>moist</b> walls <b>and</b> the crevices of rocks and places where recent fires have taken place.|$|R
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} a dry line, which {{separates}} the drier {{air from the}} more <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> humid air, formed ahead of the cold front across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and tracked eastward. The high humidity levels with dew points in the 70s°F (low 20s°C), temperatures that in many areas were near 80°F (27°C), strong wind shear {{and the presence of}} the dry line helped develop the instability to produce severe thunderstorms across the Midwest and Southern Plains on October 17.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{saprobic}} fungus, Cyathus olla obtains {{nutrients from}} {{the breakdown of}} dead organic matter, and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> shaded locations, although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima, Peru, {{suggest that it is}} tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; it has also been reported in Australia, South Africa, Iran, and India.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
5|$|The tree prefers <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> loamy soils, but is {{adaptable}} {{to a very}} wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade. In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas. The tree of heaven is found within {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China. In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
50|$|A fibrous bristle load holds {{significant}} amounts of water which mix with the soap lifted from a shaving mug or scuttle. The more water a brush holds, the <b>moister</b> <b>and</b> richer a lather will be. Thicker and more emollient lather translates to less razor skipping and dragging.|$|R
50|$|The potato, {{although}} a late introduction to Finland, features {{heavily in the}} diet and has {{found its way into}} many kinds of breads. Usually dough made with potato will be very soft and the bread will be <b>moister</b> <b>and</b> fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread.|$|R
40|$|Degradation of the {{material}} properties of the Al alloy is examined {{to determine the effects}} of <b>moist</b> air <b>and</b> predissolved hydrogen on elevated-temperature fatigue and fracture resistance. Experiments are conducted at 175 C in both <b>moist</b> air <b>and</b> high vacuum with as-processed specimens and specimens that are vacuum-heat-treated. Fracture mechanics characterizations are made for initiation and propagation fracture toughnesses during rising load, fatigue-crack propagation kinetics, and sustained-load crack-growth rates. Time-dependent embrittlement at intermediate temperatures is identified in both plate and extrusion samples of the Al-Fe-Si-V alloy 8009. Intermediate temperature cracking is found to be the same for each case in both vacuum <b>and</b> <b>moist</b> air, <b>and</b> the vacuum heat treatment does not significantly affect the results...|$|R
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils <b>moist,</b> <b>and</b> by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E

5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{biodiversity}} is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats. Three {{quarters of the}} land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to 18th century. , over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala. Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened. Its 9,400km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470km2), tropical <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100km2 and 100km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100km2). Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested. Three of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, as well as 1455.4km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling. Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats. The world's oldest teak plantation 'Conolly's Plot' is in Nilambur.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active {{floodplain}} covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was <b>moist</b> <b>and</b> warm, though subject to seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of ferns (Cladophlebis), horsetails, and giant conifers (Protojuniperoxylon). These plants formed lowland forests {{along the banks of}} rivers. Herrerasaurus remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic South America alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long Eoraptor, as well as Saurosuchus, a giant land-living rauisuchian (a quadrupedal meat eater with a theropod-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller Venaticosuchus, an ornithosuchid; and the predatory therapsid chiniquodontids. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by rhynchosaurs such as Hyperodapedon (a beaked reptile); aetosaurs (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including kannemeyeriid dicynodonts (stocky, front-heavy beaked quadrupedal animals) such as Ischigualastia and traversodontid cynodonts (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as Exaeretodon. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early ornithischian dinosaurs like Pisanosaurus.|$|E
