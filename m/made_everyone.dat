25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> happy (or homesick, as the case may be), just to look at if.|$|E

500|$|During the movie's press tour {{she also}} said her {{performance}} as Miranda was inspired by different men she knew, but did not say which ones. In 2016 she disclosed to Variety that she took Miranda's soft speaking style from Clint Eastwood: [...] "He never, ever, ever raises his voice and everyone has to lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room." [...] However, she said, Eastwood does not make jokes, so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director Mike Nichols, whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> laugh, including the target.

He learned to play with his brothers, playing with a [...] "gum-wood bat and a piece of banksia root chiselled down to make a ball." [...] He learned to bowl because his older brothers dominated the batting rights. His bowling action was far from the classic leg spin bowler's run-up and delivery, indeed, according to Wisden, [...] "he was asked to make up the numbers in a Sydney junior match and, with a method that at first <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> giggle, whipped out the opposition".

500|$|Other planned dream {{sequences}} were drastically altered due {{to production}} issues. One such scene, {{made to look}} like 80's-style film stock, had Dean being confronted by serial killer Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th film series. After production cleared the rights to use the character, Kripke <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> view [...] to help them create the [...] "perfect facsimile" [...] of Jason. However, the film studio that had granted permission realized a few days before filming that it did not actually own the rights. In dire need of a new concept, the writers recalled Sam's dream sequence with Bela; since Sam is revealed to be a [...] "horn dog" [...] underneath, the writers wanted Dean to be the opposite. Dean secretly desires a normal family, so they had Cindy Sampson reprise her role as Lisa BraedenDean's love interest from [...] "The Kids are Alright". On retrospect, Kripke preferred this scene over Jason because it is more illuminating of Dean's character.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery {{in mind when he}} suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Virgin Media gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, writing: [...] "It is that {{precious}} entity that [...] still produces {{every now and}} then: a brilliant 'Holiday'-style summer-friendly pop song." [...] Keith Caulfield from Billboard called {{it one of the}} best tracks of the album, and said that [...] "while the lyrics aren't provocative or necessarily new, it's still a peppy little tune that would sound great [...] "on the radio." [...] Laurence Green from musicOMH, also praised the track, writing that [...] "the song repositions Madonna as the American Queen triumphant {{with the aid of a}} properly classic 'Madge melody' that echoes her '80s greats." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, praised the composition and its similarity to [...] "Get Together". In another review of the album for BBC News, Levine listed [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] as one of the thrilling tracks of MDNA, saying that the drop was like [...] "an open manhole". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy noted that although there were few cliches with the lyrics, the production of the song was strong, and reminiscent of Daft Punk's music. Nitush Abebe from New York magazine called the song as one of the standouts on MDNA, along with [...] "I'm a Sinner" [...] and [...] "I'm Addicted". Gareth Grundy from The Guardian praised the [...] "more relaxed, less stentorian" [...] vibe of the track, adding that the song [...] "is the kind of giddy, live-for-the-moment tune that <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> fall for her in the first place. Think 'Into the Groove' or 'Open Your Heart', at least in spirit." [...] Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club felt that the lyrics were lazy and although the song had a [...] "great hook", it is pulled down [...] "by a pile of clichés [...] what could have been one of the album’s strongest tracks." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{effects of}} Lat's works were not {{confined}} to the artistic sector. [...] In the period before his debut, Malaysian cartoonists supported calls for national unity. [...] The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. [...] Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. [...] The situation erupted with the racial riots of 1969, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. [...] According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation's racial woes with his works. [...] Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. [...] Redza pointed out although one may argue that Lat was forced into the role of racial and cultural mediator (because of his employment with his country's [...] "leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership"), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. [...] Lat's fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as [...] "a safe and nice humour that <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides". [...] It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. [...] The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. [...] She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of xenophobic phrases, full of profound sadness.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people."

Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E

Tony was shot by Uncle Junior in the same episode, and {{was in a coma}} for the next two episodes. While Tony's recovery seemed uncertain, Vito hinted at the idea that he should take over as boss. At the time, Silvio Dante was acting boss, but ended up suffering an asthma attack from the stress. Vito informed DiMeo Family capo Larry Boy Barese that he was the best candidate for boss since he was the capo of the highest-earning crew in the family. While Tony was comatose, Vito also provided information to Paulie about the location of $1 million in drug money hidden by Colombian drug dealers. Paulie and one of Vito's men stole the money, although they were nearly killed by two Colombians guarding the stash. Paulie was seriously injured during the theft when one of the dealers kneed him in the groin, causing serious medical problems. Paulie demanded a higher cut because of his injury. Paulie and Vito also became angry when Silvio demanded a higher percentage of the cut go to Carmela in case Tony did not recover. Tony finally awoke from his coma, which <b>made</b> <b>everyone</b> ecstatic—except Vito who was hoping to step in and take Tony's place.
