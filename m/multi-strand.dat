The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, where hundreds of burials dating 2900–2300 BC were unearthed; tombs {{such as that of}} Puabi contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In Assyria, men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including amulets, ankle bracelets, heavy <b>multi-strand</b> necklaces, and cylinder seals.|$|E
500|$|De Marignac was {{the first}} to prepare the metal in 1864, when he reduced niobium {{chloride}} by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, {{it was not until the}} early 20th century that niobium was used in incandescent lamp filaments, the first commercial application. This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten, which has a higher melting point. That niobium improves the strength of steel was first discovered in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use. In 1961, the American physicist Eugene Kunzler and coworkers at Bell Labs discovered that niobium-tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields, making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrical power machinery. This discovery enabled — two decades later — the production of long <b>multi-strand</b> cables wound into coils to create large, powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery, particle accelerators, and particle detectors.Sn|author=Matthias, B.

500|$|The show's {{eleventh}} series saw musical montage or [...] "songtage" [...] segments become {{standard in}} each episode, introduced by McHale {{as a means}} of modernising the show. Although McHale initially considered commissioning original pieces, budgetary constraints limited choices to pre-existing tracks. The use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama Grey's Anatomy, however McHale stated he was unaware of this until Holby City had already adopted the technique. Music was generally selected by each episode's scriptwriter. If the writer was not specific about which songs should be used, the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors also have some input: Hugh Quarshie personally selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle responded: [...] "Yes – sometimes. On a <b>multi-strand</b> series such as Holby, they are an excellent way of telling stories visually – a moment from each – to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience." [...] Kris Green of entertainment and media website Digital Spy suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be [...] "very jarring", to which Kyle replied: [...] "We plan to use music carefully in the future – maybe 'songtages', as above – and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio – but less incidental." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare {{two types}} of fixed {{orthodontic}} retainers (a <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer and a modified retainer) in relation to established periodontal parameters. The <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer is commonly used, and the modified retainer has bends to enable free access of dental floss to interproximal areas. Materials and Methods: For this crossover study, 12 volunteers were selected and used the following retainers for six months: (A) a <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer and (B) a modified retainer, both fixed to all anterior lower teeth. After this experimental period, the following evaluations were made: Dental Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Dental Calculus Index and Retainer Wire Calculus Index. The volunteers also responded to a questionnaire about the use, comfort and hygiene of the retainers. Results: The plaque index and the gingival index were higher on the lingual surfaces (p< 0. 05) for the modified retainer. Furthermore, the calculus index was statistically higher (p< 0. 05) for the lingual and proximal faces when using the modified retainer. The retainer wire calculus index values were also significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for the modified retainer. In the questionnaire, 58 % of the volunteers considered the modified retainer to be less comfortable and 54 % of them preferred the <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer. Conclusion: The <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer showed better results than the modified retainer according to the periodontal parameters evaluated, {{as well as providing}} greater comfort and being the retainer preferred by the volunteers...|$|R

Non-denatured double-stranded DNA array elements were shown to hybridize to single-stranded (ss) DNA probes. Similarly, ssDNA array elements were shown to bind duplex DNA probes. This led to a series of experiments demonstrating the formation of <b>multi-stranded</b> DNA structures on the surface of microarrays. These structures were observed with a number of heterogeneous sequences, including both purine and pyrimidine bases, with shared sequence identity between the ssDNA and one of the duplex strands. Furthermore, we observed a strong binding preference near the ends of duplexes containing a 3 ′-homologous strand.

The mol. wt. {{of the four}} single-stranded RNA species were 4 " 0 x lO % 3 " 1 x lO 6, 2. 3 x I 0 ° and 1. 8 x lO 8.

The first species of virus RNA detected were the <b>multi-stranded</b> and double-stranded species of RNA. The first single-stranded species detected was the 42 S virus particle RNA, at 1 " 5 h after infection.

30|$|In this study, newer {{retentive}} preference {{was compared}} with the standard method in the maxillary and the mandibular arches. The {{results showed that the}} reliability with the <b>multi-stranded</b> wire retainer was comparable to the ribbon retainer in both arches.

In the 2 -year study of Rose et al.[20], the ribbon-reinforced retainer remained in place for an average of 11.5 months, and this time was 23.6 months for the <b>multi-stranded</b> retainer. This study was conducted only in the mandibular arch. Moreover, in the study of Tacken et al.[24], the maxillary incisors and the six mandibular anterior teeth were fixed.

30|$|<b>Multi-stranded</b> wire {{retainers}} were fabricated from a 0.0175 -in <b>multi-stranded</b> {{stainless steel}} wire and were bonded to the lingual surfaces of the anterior teeth. Before bonding, the retainer wires were carefully shaped on the working model cast, using three-pronged wire-bending pliers (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, California) to provide an exact adaptation to the lingual surfaces. The anterior segment was isolated by rubber dam. The enamel was cleaned and polished with a low-speed hand piece using rubber cap with non-fluoridated pumice for 20 s. Then, it was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel (3 M Unitek) for 30 s and washed for 20 s and air dried. A segment of 0.0175 -in <b>multi-stranded</b> wire and Heliosit® orthodontic resin composite (Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) {{was used in this}} group. The adhesive bis-GMA sealant (Fluoro Bond, Ormco) was applied on all teeth and light-cured with a light-emitting diode (Ortholux; 3 M Unitek) for 5 s per tooth. Subsequently, the <b>multi-stranded</b> wire was placed on the teeth, and the Heliosit® Orthodontic resin composite was applied to attach the wire to the anterior teeth over the sealant. Each tooth was light-cured for 10 s after adjusting the retainer correctly. During the setting process, the retainer wire was fixed to the inter-proximal contacts and bonded passively to each anterior tooth. After light curing, the resin composite was contoured and polished.|$|R
