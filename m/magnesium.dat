5|$|Alcohol {{acts as a}} <b>magnesium</b> diuretic, {{causes a}} prompt, {{vigorous}} increase in the urinary excretion of <b>magnesium</b> and other electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is {{the reduction of}} curium(IV) oxide using a magnesium-zinc alloy in a melt of <b>magnesium</b> chloride and <b>magnesium</b> fluoride.|$|E
5|$|A {{differently}} designed torch {{was used}} for the final leg. It was made of stainless steel and was fueled by <b>magnesium</b> {{in order to ensure that}} the flame showed up properly during the opening ceremony. It was also designed by Ralph Lavers, with the frame for the torch created by EMI, and the <b>magnesium</b> candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering. Neither the suppliers nor designer charged a fee for the final torch.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>magnesium</b> ion is {{critical}} for ATP binding in the kinase domain. The presence of Mg2+ regulates kinase activity.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{reacts with}} calcium and <b>magnesium</b> hydrides in tetrahydrofuran forming tetrahydroaluminates.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alloying}} agent with <b>magnesium</b> to create high-strength metals {{that are used}} in aircraft engines; yttrium and neodymium are also viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for <b>magnesium</b> in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than <b>magnesium</b> oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|Large {{jumps in}} the {{successive}} molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For <b>magnesium</b> again, {{the first two}} molar ionization energies of <b>magnesium</b> given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730kJ/mol, {{for the removal of}} a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.|$|E
5|$|Liquid sodium {{has also}} been used instead of <b>magnesium</b> as the {{reducing}} agent, as in the Hunter process.|$|E
5|$|Maximum weight {{limits for}} aluminium, brass, <b>magnesium</b> and zinc {{castings}} are approximately , , , and , respectively.|$|E
5|$|Other {{topics of}} {{research}} have included investigations into mannitol, dexamethasone, progesterone, xenon, barbiturates, <b>magnesium,</b> calcium channel blockers, PPAR-γ agonists, curcuminoids, ethanol, NMDA antagonists, caffeine.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when <b>magnesium</b> carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or <b>magnesium</b> carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), <b>magnesium</b> oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of <b>magnesium</b> metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US <b>Magnesium</b> operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of <b>magnesium,</b> more than any other North American <b>magnesium</b> operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
5|$|The US {{state of}} Oregon uses <b>magnesium</b> chloride, a {{relatively}} cheap chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, but less reactive, while New Zealand uses calcium <b>magnesium</b> acetate, which avoids the environmentally harmful chloride ion altogether. Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>magnesium</b> {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from nearly 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter. The concentration is close to 0 for the first third of the creek's course, but then rises to two or three milligrams per liter. The <b>magnesium</b> concentration reaches its peak around halfway between the source and the mouth, then steadily declines to slightly under ten milligrams per liter at the mouth. However, one of Buffalo Creek's tributaries has a <b>magnesium</b> {{concentration of}} nearly 35 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with <b>magnesium,</b> yielding <b>magnesium</b> chloride and the metals.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can react}} violently with {{aluminium}} and <b>magnesium</b> powders, with chlorinated rubber and linseed oil on heating causing fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and <b>magnesium</b> remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding <b>magnesium.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the above mechanisms, the average adult with DKA has a total body water {{shortage}} of about 6liters (or 100mL/kg), in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, <b>magnesium</b> and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13.8mmol/L or 250mg/dL.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with <b>magnesium</b> metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten <b>magnesium</b> in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} <b>magnesium,</b> strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and <b>magnesium</b> by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with <b>magnesium</b> often allows it to replace <b>magnesium</b> in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order. For example, KMgCl3 is named <b>magnesium</b> potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, <b>magnesium</b> dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, {{infusion}} of silicon carbide nano-particles in molten <b>magnesium</b> was {{mentioned as a}} way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy suitable for use in aeronautics, aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.|$|E
5|$|Morton Salt, Cargill Salt, Broken Arrow Salt and the Renco Group's U.S. <b>Magnesium</b> each extract {{minerals}} {{from the}} southern bay, and could benefit from a more natural mixture of water {{between the two sides}} of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in commercial applications, {{but a small}} percentage is converted to the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by {{the reduction of the}} zirconium(IV) chloride with <b>magnesium</b> metal in the Kroll process. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{tungsten}} electrodes (classified as WP or EWP) are {{general purpose}} and low cost electrodes. They have poor heat resistance and electron emission. They find limited use in AC welding of e.g. <b>magnesium</b> and aluminum.|$|E
5|$|RNA Holliday {{junctions}} assume an antiparallel stacked conformation at high <b>magnesium</b> concentrations, a perpendicular stacked conformation at moderate concentrations, {{and rotate}} into a parallel stacked conformation at low concentrations, while even small calcium ion concentrations favor the antiparallel conformer.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and <b>magnesium</b> compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and <b>magnesium</b> waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
5|$|Since many {{substrates}} are not stable to sodium hydride, several {{procedures have}} been developed using milder bases. Masamune and Roush have developed mild conditions using lithium chloride and DBU. Rathke extended this to lithium or <b>magnesium</b> halides with triethylamine. Several other bases have been found effective.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{aforementioned}} compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen. These can also include small amounts of boron, <b>magnesium,</b> aluminum, silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 has a {{conventional}} aerodynamic layout with a shoulder-mounted trapezoidal wing and a traditional tailplane and rudder. Several metals {{are used in}} the construction of the airframe: 60% aluminium, 19% steel, 13.5% titanium, 2% <b>magnesium</b> alloy and 5.5% other materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium and <b>magnesium</b> have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and <b>magnesium</b> form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of calcium at the gauging station near Bloomsburg has ranged from 5.5mg/L to 26mg/L, averaging 7.532mg/L. The {{concentration of}} <b>magnesium</b> has ranged from 1.5mg/L to 6.7mg/L, {{with an average}} of 1.748mg/L.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common metals such as iron, copper, and tin, {{and precious}} metals such as silver, gold, and platinum—are heavy metals. From 1809 onwards, light metals, such as <b>magnesium,</b> aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy metals including gallium, thallium, and hafnium.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plutonium}} core, {{along with}} its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported {{in the custody of}} Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a <b>magnesium</b> field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. <b>Magnesium</b> was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.|$|E
