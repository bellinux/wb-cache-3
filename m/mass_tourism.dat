5|$|The bulk of {{the tourist}} {{industry}} is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast. Opatija was the first holiday resort {{since the middle of}} the 19th century. By the 1890s, it {{became one of the most}} significant European health resorts. Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services ranging from <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> to catering and various niche markets, the most significant being nautical tourism, as there are numerous marinas with more than 16thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer mountain resorts, agrotourism and spas. Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.|$|E

25|$|Tourism is {{the second-largest}} {{part of the}} economy. The war brought the islands newfound fame, and {{tourists}} came both to see the islands' wildlife and go on war tours.

25|$|Up {{until the}} early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, {{including}} Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and Empress Elisabeth of Austria; today it is also widely visited by middle class families (primarily from the UK, Scandinavia and Germany). With {{the advent of the}} jet airliner bringing these groups relatively affordable 'package holidays', Corfu was one of the primary destinations for this new form of <b>mass</b> <b>tourism.</b> It is still popular with the ultra-wealthy however, and in the island's northeast the homeowners include members of the Rothschild family and Russian oligarchs.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{legislation}} is very strict, and every tourism project must undergo an environmental review and a lengthy process of consultations {{with the public}} and conservationists. Seychelles is a world leader in sustainable tourism. The end result of this sustainable development is an intact and stable natural environment, which attracts financially strong visitors (150,000 in 2007) rather than short-term <b>mass</b> <b>tourism.</b> Since 1993 a law guarantees the citizens {{the right to a}} clean environment {{and at the same time}} obliges them to protect this environment. The country holds a record for the highest percentage of land under natural conservation—nearly 50% of the total land area.|$|E
25|$|By 1915, city touring {{had marked}} {{significant}} {{shifts in the}} way Americans perceived, organized and moved around in urban environments. Urban tourism became a profitable industry in 1915 {{as the number of}} tour agencies, railroad passenger departments, guidebook publishers and travel writers grew at a fast pace. The expense of pleasure tours meant that only the minority of Americans between 1850 and 1915 could experience the luxury of tourism. Many Americans traveled to find work, but few found time for enjoyment of the urban environment. As transportation networks improved, the length of commuting decreased, and income rose. A growing number of Americans were able to afford short vacations by 1915. Still, <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> was not possible until after World War II.|$|E

25|$|After World War II Spain was {{politically}} and economically isolated, and was {{kept out of the}} United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation, a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities {{and the creation of a}} <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. Franco's rule was also characterised by authoritarianism, promotion of a unitary national identity, the favouring of a very conservative form of Roman Catholicism known as National Catholicism, and discriminatory language policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} of <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> and large luxury hotels {{had arrived in}} Paris under Napoleon III, driven by new railroads and the huge crowds that had come for the first international expositions. The expositions and the crowds grew even larger during the Belle Époque; twenty-three million visitors came to Paris for the 1889 exposition, and the 1900 exposition welcomed forty-eight million visitors. The Grand Hôtel du Louvre, built for the universal exposition of 1855, opened that same year. The Grand Hôtel on the Boulevard des Capucines opened in 1862. More luxury hotels appeared near the train stations and in the city center during the Belle Époque; the Hôtel Continental opened in 1878 on the Rue de Rivoli {{on the site of}} the old Ministry of Finance, which had been burned by the Paris Commune. The Hôtel Ritz on the Place Vendôme opened in 1898, and the Hôtel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde opened in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making {{irrigation}} and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting {{to less than}} 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere {{throughout the rest of}} the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.|$|E
50|$|Religious tourism, also {{commonly}} referred to as faith tourism, is a type of tourism, where people travel individually or in groups for pilgrimage, missionary, or leisure (fellowship) purposes. The world's largest form of <b>mass</b> religious <b>tourism</b> takes place at the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. North American religious tourists comprise an estimated $10 billion of the industry.|$|R

500|$|Since Angkor Wat {{has seen}} {{significant}} growth in tourism throughout the years, UNESCO and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), {{in association with}} representatives from the Royal Government and APSARA, organised seminars to discuss the concept of [...] "cultural tourism". Wanting to avoid commercial and <b>mass</b> <b>tourism,</b> the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services {{in order for the}} Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture. In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the [...] "Angkor Tourist City" [...] which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.|$|E
2500|$|... 1989–present: Though the Peronism {{replaced}} the radicals in central government amid a national financial crisis, the latter party continued to rule in Mar del Plata.

By contrast, {{the first decade of the}} 21st century shows an amazingly quick recovery in all sectors of the ailing economy.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Spanish miracle" [...] fed {{itself on}} the rural exodus which created {{a new class of}} {{industrial}} workers. The economic boom led to an increase in rapid, largely unplanned building {{on the periphery of the}} cities of the Costa del Sol to accommodate the new workers arriving from the countryside. Some cities preserved their historic centres, but most were altered by often haphazard commercial and residential developments. The same fate befell long stretches of scenic coastline as <b>mass</b> <b>tourism</b> exploded.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifting of}} petrol {{rationing}} by the Menzies Federal government, the increased affordability of cars for the wider population and longer paid holidays were catalysts {{for the growth}} of <b>mass</b> motor <b>tourism</b> during the 1950s.

Queensland's caravan registration figures grew rapidly during the decade from 2320 in 1953, to 5406 in 1961.|$|R
