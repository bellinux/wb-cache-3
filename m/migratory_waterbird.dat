5000|$|According to the Ramsar definition, {{more than}} two-thirds of the countryâ€™s landmass may be {{classified}} as wetlands. It is a country dominated by wetland including estuaries, mangrove swamps namely the Sundarbans, freshwater marshes such as haor, swamps and rivers. There are about 628 bird species in Bangladesh, of which 244 are Migratory. About 100 species of migratory birds regularly or occasionally visit the country. Considering the present threats to waterbird conservation in the country, 31 <b>migratory</b> <b>waterbird</b> species are of high priority for future action for conservation. 14 of these species are threatened.The wetlands are home to about 70 species of resident waterbirds including ducks, grebe, cormorants, bitterns, herons, egrets, storks, rails, jacanas, finfoot, waders, gulls, turns and skimmers. Eleven species of resident waterbirds are identified as threatened. The important threatened species are masked finfoot, Indian skimmer, black-headed ibis, greater adjutant, lesser adjutant, Baikal teal, Baer's pochard, ferruginous pochard, wood snipe, Nordmann's greenshank and spoon-billed sandpiper. [...] The wetlands of Bangladesh are being degraded rapidly due to population pressure, withdrawal of water for irrigation, destruction of swamp forest and many other anthropogenic and natural causes. Large scale habitat conversion, unsustainable harvesting policies and lack of ecological considerations have led to the destruction of valuable wetland habitat for water birds and other associated biodiversity. Immediate action is required for restoring these habitats and conserving the water birds in Bangladesh. The Key breeding and staging areas of Bangladesh are: Haor areas such as the Meghna estuary, Tanguar haor and Hail-Hakaluki haors, Chalan Beel, the Sundarbans and other coastal mangroves including Hatia and Nijhum Dweep, haor areas of the north west and off shore Islands.|$|E

Of the screened loci, 57 % amplified successfully and 24 % were polymorphic. In two breeding colonies from southern Brazil (N = 131) we detected 32 alleles (2 - 10 alleles/ locus). Average He over all loci and colonies was 0. 55, and the combined probability of excluding false parents, 98 %. There was no departure from HWE in any loci or population. Eru 6 and Eru 4 loci were in non-random association in the Alvorada colony, and NnNF 5 and Eru 5 in both populations.

40|$|Evaluating the {{potential}} involvement of wild avifauna in {{the emergence of}} highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1 (hereafter H 5 N 1) requires detailed analyses of temporal and spatial relationships between wild bird movements and disease emergence. The death of wild swans (Cygnus spp.) has been the first indicator of the presence of H 5 N 1 in various Asian and European countries; however their role in the geographic spread of the disease remains poorly understood. We marked 10 whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) with GPS transmitters in northeastern Mongolia during autumn 2006 and tracked their migratory movements in relation to H 5 N 1 outbreaks. The prevalence of H 5 N 1 outbreaks among poultry in eastern Asia during 2003 â€“ 2007 peaked during winter, concurrent with whooper swan movements into regions of high poultry density. However outbreaks involving poultry were detected year round, indicating disease perpetuation independent of <b>migratory</b> <b>waterbird</b> presence. In contrast, H 5 N 1 outbreaks involving whooper swans, as well as other migratory waterbirds that succumbed to the disease in eastern Asia, tended to occur during seasons (late spring and summer) and in habitats (areas of natural vegetation) where their potential for contact with poultry is very low to nonexistent.

40|$|Human {{settlements}} have mainly destroyed {{natural habitat}} but {{also led to}} the creation of new ones, some of them suitable for wildlife. In this line, the construction of artificial ponds for irrigation of agricultural land or on golf courses may also provide new habitats for waterbirds. Large freshwater wetlands are absent or very scarce on the Canary Islands, so both migratory and resident waterbirds usually use artificial water bodies as feeding or nesting sites. We compared monthly censuses over a period of ten years (2000 â€“ 2009) in water bodies for agricultural irrigation and decorative pools on a nearby golf course on the Canary Islands and found differences in the number and species composition of waterbirds. We recorded a total of 51 <b>migratory</b> <b>waterbird</b> species. Average monthly abundance was fairly low in both sites, being higher in agricultural ponds (22. 0 vs. 3. 8 birds/monthly censuses), while overall species richness was slightly higher in the golf course (40 vs. 35 species). We suggest that these differences are related to the habitat features of both water body types. Waterbird abundance and diversity was higher during winter and passage months. Conserving, improving and managing correctly these sites could be of socio-economic interest for local people since some species observed are of conservation concern, and ornithological tourism is increasing...|$|E
40|$|AimSpecies are {{responding}} to climate change by changing their distributions, creating debate {{about the effectiveness of}} existing networks of protected areas. As a contribution to this debate, we assess whether regional winter abundances and distribution of the Smew Mergellus albellus, a <b>migratory</b> <b>waterbird</b> species listed on Annex I (EU Birds Directive) that overwinters exclusively in European wetlands, changed during 1990 - 2011, the role of global warming in driving distributional changes and the effectiveness of the network of Special Protection Areas (SPAs, EU Birds Directive) in the context of climate change. LocationEurope. MethodsWe used site-specific counts (6, 883 sites) from 16 countries covering the entire flyway to estimate annual abundance indices and trends at country, region (north-eastern, central and south-western) and flyway scales, inside and outside SPAs. We fitted autoregressive models to assess the effect of winter temperature on the annual abundance indices whilst accounting for autocorrelation. ResultsThe Smew wintering distribution shifted north-eastwards in Europe in accordance with the predictions of global warming, with increasing numbers in the north-eastern region and declines in the central region. Trends in wintering numbers were more positive in SPAs on the north-eastern and south-western part of the flyway. However, {{a large proportion of the}} wintering population remains unprotected in north-eastern areas outside of the existing SPA network. Main conclusionsSPAs accommodated climate-driven abundance changes in the north-eastern region of the wintering distribution by supporting increasing numbers of Smew in traditional and newly colonized areas. However, we highlight gaps in the current network, suggesting that urgent policy responses are needed. Given rapid changes in species distributions, we urge regular national and international assessments of the adequacy of the EU Natura 2000 network to ensure coherence in site-safeguard networks for this and other species...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} period of rapid, {{worldwide}} change in climate and landuse (i. e., global change), successful biodiversity conservation warrants proactive management responses, especially for long-distance migratory species. However, {{the development and}} implementation of management strategies can be impeded by high levels of uncertainty and low levels of control over potentially impactful future events and their effects. Scenario planning and modeling are useful tools for expanding perspectives and informing decisions under these conditions. We coupled scenario planning and statistical modeling to explain and predict playa wetland inundation (i. e., presence/absence of water) and ponded area (i. e., extent of water) in the Rainwater Basin, an anthropogenically altered landscape that provides critical stopover habitat for migratory waterbirds. Inundation and ponded area models for total wetlands, those embedded in rowcrop fields, and those not embedded in rowcrop fields were trained and tested with wetland ponding data from 2004 and 2006 â€“ 2009, and then used to make additional predictions under two alternative climate change scenarios for the year 2050, yielding a total of six predictive models and 18 prediction sets. Model performance ranged from moderate to good, with inundation models outperforming ponded area models, and models for non-rowcrop-embedded wetlands outperforming models for total wetlands and rowcrop-embedded wetlands. Model predictions indicate that if the temperature and precipitation changes assumed under our climate change scenarios occur, wetland stopover habitat availability in the Rainwater Basin could decrease in the future. The results of this and similar studies could be aggregated to increase knowledge about the potential spatial and temporal distributions of future stopover habitat along migration corridors, and to develop and prioritize multi-scale management actions aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of global change on <b>migratory</b> <b>waterbird</b> populations...|$|E
