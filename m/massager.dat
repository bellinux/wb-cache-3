Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Seisakusho registered the trademark to the Magic Wand. It became available to the mass market in the U.S. during the 1970s and was advertised as a device to aid with massage techniques. It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches, and is registered with the Food and Drug Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric <b>massager.</b> The stated use of the Magic Wand is the soothing and relaxing of sore muscles and nerves, relieving tension, and rehabilitation after sports injuries.|$|E
5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the <b>massager</b> is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E

Apart from its size, bulk, and its reliance on a mains power supply that limits its portability, it is not waterproof or water-resistant, and it overheats when used for more than 25 minutes. It does not work well in electrical outlets in all countries internationally.|$|E
500|$|The Magic Wand {{received}} the nickname [...] "the Cadillac of vibrators" [...] from the sex shop Good Vibrations. Boutique erotica store Babeland founders Rachel Venning and Claire Cavanah called the <b>massager</b> the Rolls-Royce of vibrators in their 2003 book Sex Toys 101; this characterization was echoed by authors Anne Hooper and Philip Hodson, and physician Michael L. Krychman. Venning and Cavanah {{observed that the}} device alleviated discomfort from menstrual cramps. They recommended the Magic Wand to new users of vibrators who asked for a suggestion for a starter device. Cavanah observed that the Magic Wand was unique among vibrators for its success through word-of-mouth marketing.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} using a neck <b>massager</b> for other than its stated purpose was popularized in 2002 in the fifth-season episode of the {{television}} series Sex and the City, [...] "Critical Condition". The character Samantha Jones goes to Sharper Image to buy a vibrator, but {{the staff at the}} store tell her it is a neck <b>massager.</b> Shortly after being featured on Sex and the City, the Magic Wand sold out of stores. Journalist Naomi Wolf wrote in The Sunday Times that while researching for an article on the female-oriented sex toys catalogue Good Vibrations, she was informed that the Magic Wand had sold out from their stock because of its appearance on Sex and the City. The Rabbit vibrator had previously seen an increase in sales, after it was similarly popularized on the program in 1998. According to a contribution to Best Sex Writing 2013 by Andy Isaacson, these appearances of sex toys on Sex and the City revolutionized the way they were perceived culturally in the United States. The Times noted the Magic Wand was relatively new to the market in the United Kingdom, where it became available in 2004. The Magic Wand was number seven of the top ten hand-held massagers sold on Amazon.com. Faye Flam writing for Knight Ridder Newspapers reported in 2006 that the Magic Wand was exempt from anti-vibrator laws in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas because it {{did not appear to be}} a phallic object. In 2006 the device was among the top-selling masturbation aids in the market.|$|E

500|$|The Hitachi Magic Wand (renamed as Magic Wand Original and Original Magic Wand and {{referred}} to simply as Magic Wand) is an electrical, AC-powered vibrating <b>massager,</b> originally manufactured for relieving tension and relaxing sore muscles, but most famous for its use as a sex toy. Japanese company Hitachi listed the device for business in the United States in 1968. Sex educator Betty Dodson popularized its use as a vibrator and masturbation aid for women during the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. It functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator {{and is able to}} bring women to orgasm. The wand is [...] long and weighs [...] with stimulation provided by its rubberized [...] head.|$|E
500|$|Hitachi {{executives}} assisted {{financing the}} production of chocolates {{in the shape of}} the <b>massager</b> in 1992, in honor of the 15-year anniversary of the sex shop Good Vibrations. Subsequently, the company asserted in 1999 its sole intended use was for health care purposes. Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor in 2000 and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor Vibratex. The Magic Wand sold out after being featured in a 2002 episode of Sex and the City. Hitachi decided to cease production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having the company name attached to a sex toy. Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name [...] "Original Magic Wand", omitting the Hitachi name. In 2014, the company used the name [...] "Magic Wand Original".|$|E
500|$|In January 2014 the device's {{name was}} [...] "Magic Wand Original" [...] {{according}} to Shape Magazine, with information provided at the associated website magicwandoriginal.com. Hitachi did not market the device for sexual purposes until recently, as of October 2016, but still only referring {{to one of}} its uses as an [...] "intimate" [...] <b>massager.</b> Betty Dodson told Engadget in 2014 that the device was still her preferred vibrator. On 5 May 2014, the device was featured in a comedy segment of the television program Louie on FX. In 2014, 250,000 Magic Wands were sold in the U.S. by Vibratex. In November 2014, Stanford School of Medicine assistant professor {{of obstetrics and gynecology}} Leah Millheiser recommended the Magic Wand. She commented to Yahoo!

500|$|Rachel Kramer Bussel {{praised the}} device in a 2011 article for SexIs Magazine titled: [...] "10 Reasons The Hitachi Magic Wand is My Favorite Vibrator". She {{composed}} her {{article in the}} form of an ode to her favorite toy. Her rationale for selecting the device as her favorite included its power, speed it takes her to a state of increased arousal, its lack of need for batteries, its delivery of intense clitoral sensations, and its affordability. Yana Tallon-Hicks described the device in a 2011 piece for the Valley Advocate, and wrote that it was quite effective at bringing women to orgasm. She compared its intensity to a Mack Truck. Valley Advocate recommended the Magic Wand in a 2012 article for overweight partners to use during sex because of its longer handle. Ashleigh Corbeil wrote in her book about achieving a simultaneous orgasm for two partners that due to its length the Magic Wand could be used during doggy style intercourse; and Hilda Hutcherson similarly advised use of the <b>massager</b> in this sexual position.|$|E
500|$|The Magic Wand {{has been}} a bestseller at the sex shop Good Vibrations since it opened in 1977. The shop marketed the magic wand to women as an {{effective}} means of stimulating the clitoris. The device became an enduring bestseller in adult sex toy shops in the United States. It has become known colloquially among women as [...] "Big Buzzy", and is also simply referred to as [...] "The Hitachi". During the 1980s, the device was advertised in the back pages of Mother Jones magazine. It became popular with women and was featured {{on the cover of the}} book Good Vibrations: The New Complete Guide to Vibrators (1976) by Joani Blank. The Magic Wand features on the covers of the 1989 and 1998 editions of the book. In 1992 for the 15th anniversary of the opening of Good Vibrations, the sex store managers arranged to have chocolates manufactured in the shape of the Magic Wand. Sales staff from the corporate headquarters of Hitachi company contributed finances towards the creation of the chocolates in the shape of their <b>massager.</b> The Hitachi executives additionally purchased 500 of the massager-shaped chocolates which were given out at the company's sales conference that year.|$|E
500|$|Because of the Magic Wand's popularity, various {{aftermarket}} attachments with {{differences in}} colour, pattern of studs, and material, became available to purchase. Such attachments {{have been produced}} by many companies without ties to Hitachi. Without attachments, the device functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator, able to bring women to orgasm. Add-ons that are fitted {{over the top of}} the device and are used to excite the clitoris are available. An attachment called the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] allows women to feel vibrations deep into the vagina. According to an article in the Dermatology Online Journal, [...] "The Wonder Wand" [...] is created from a plastic material which is even in consistency and may be simply cleansed after use. Attachments made of silicone designed to aid with penetrative sensations or to modify texture of the device are available. An add-on called the [...] "G-Spotter" [...] fits over the device in the same fashion and turns the device into a G-spot vibrator. The [...] "Gee-Whiz" [...] (also referred to as [...] "G-Whiz") is a similar type of attachment used to stimulate the G-spot. The [...] "Fluffer Tip Wand Attachment" [...] may be placed over the device and can be used to mimic the sensation of cunnilingus. [...] "Liberator Axis" [...] is a booster pillow that stabilizes the [...] Magic Wand so the user does not have to hold it with her hands during use. Attachments have been sold by Betty Dodson on her website, which provides pictorial instructions on their use with the Magic Wand. The <b>massager</b> may be used without attachments for men or with the [...] "G-Whiz" [...] attachment; when held on the penis it can stimulate pleasurable sensations to the prostate. An attachment made by an unaffiliated company provides a cap that fits {{over the top of the}} device so it can function as a male masturbation sleeve. In Japan, an attachment is sold for men to stimulate the prostate through the rectum.|$|E

5000|$|There are safety matters {{relating}} to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant is used with prostate <b>massagers</b> to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually {{to minimize the}} discomfort that some may feel. <b>Massagers</b> may be used {{with or without a}} condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, {{it is very important to}} clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to evacuate. More often than not, this is just a [...] "feeling" [...] that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.|$|R

2500|$|A {{vibrator}} is {{a device}} intended to vibrate against {{the body and}} stimulate the nerves for a relaxing and pleasurable feeling. Some vibrators are designed as sex toys and are inserted inside the vagina or anus for erotic stimulation. The first vibrator was a steam-powered <b>massager,</b> which was invented by American physician George Taylor in 1869. Dr. Taylor recommended his vibrators for treatment of an illness known {{at the time as}} [...] "female hysteria". Hysteria, from the Greek for [...] "suffering uterus", involved anxiety, irritability, sexual fantasies, pelvic heaviness, and excessive vaginal lubrication—in other words, sexual arousal.|$|E

50|$|A {{prostate}} <b>massager</b> is {{a device}} for massaging the prostate gland. The {{shape of a}} prostate <b>massager</b> {{is similar to a}} finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via fingering). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate <b>massager</b> is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive massage, or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.|$|E
50|$|Some men prefer butt plugs, {{which are}} easy to use, can be {{inserted}} freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as masturbation. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate. Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate <b>massagers</b> {{have been developed to}} provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland. These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum. While many <b>massagers</b> rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.|$|R
