40|$|Calves with {{diarrhea}} {{often have}} small intestinal overgrowth with Escherichia coli bacteria, {{regardless of the}} inciting cause for the diarrhea, and 30 % of systemically ill calves with diarrhea have bacteremia, predominantly because of E coli. Antimicrobial treatment of diarrheic calves should therefore be focused against E coli in the small intestine and blood, the 2 sites of infection. Fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not recommended in calves with diarrhea because fecal bacterial pop-ulations do not accurately reflect small intestinal or blood bacterial populations and because the break points for susceptibility test results have not been validated. Antimicrobial efficacy is therefore best evaluated by the clinical response {{of a number of}} calves to treatment, with calves randomly assigned to treatment groups. Amoxicillin, chlortetracycline, neomycin, oxytetracycline, strep-tomycin, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline administered PO are currently labeled in the United States for the treatment of calf diarrhea. On the basis of published evidence for the oral administration of these antimicrobial agents, only amoxicillin can be recommended for the treatment of diarrhea. Dosage recommendations are amoxicillin trihydrate (10 mg/kg PO q 12 h) or amoxicillin trihydrate–clavulanate potassium (12. 5 mg combined drug/kg PO q 12 h) for at least 3 days; the latter constitutes extra-label drug use.

40|$|Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a {{recently}} discovered vector-borne Orthobunyavirus targeting ruminants. It is transmitted by Culicoides biting midges and caused a large outbreak in European sheep and cattle populations in 2011 and 2012. The infection of adults {{was associated with}} a drop in <b>milk</b> production, <b>fever</b> and diarrhea. But the virus was further shown to cross the placental barrier and to be responsible for a hydrocephaly/arthrogryposis syndrome in calves and lambs. After its occurrence in 2011 in Germany, SBV quickly spread across Europe and in spring 2012 more than 90 % of Belgian domestic cattle had seroconverted. To assess the susceptibility of wild ruminants to the infection, a total number of 547 and 494 sera, from red (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), respectively, were collected during the hunting seasons 2010 to 2012 and tested for the presence of anti-SBV antibodies. While no samples from 2010 revealed to be positive, about two-thirds of red deer and half of roe deer sampled in 2011 were seropositive. In 2012, the seroprevalence dropped to 33 % in red deer and remained stable in roe deer. The high seroprevalence rates found in both species in Belgium shows that wild ruminants are susceptible to the infection by SBV. If the infection of deer was associated to a hydrocephaly/arthrogryposis syndrome similar to that observed in domestic ruminants is still unknown. There is currently no evidence of such a transplacental passage in red or roe deer. The decrease in the seroprevalence observed in red deer in 2012 might be the result of the turn-over in the red deer population and reflect an absence of virus circulation in 2012. Further investigations in the upcoming years will help to enlighten this point. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This virus was later associated with abor-tions and congenital malformations in calves, lambs, and kids in several European countries (3). Serologic testing among wild cervids in Belgium revealed antibodies against Schmallenberg virus in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) (4). Seroprevalence was already high (27 % on average) in wild cervids in October 2011 in Belgium, suggesting that the virus began circulating months earlier (before August 2011). It has recently been shown that SBV had already circulated in Culicoides vec-tors in Belgium during August and September 2011 (5).

Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum forage proportion in the ruminant diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on pasture and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health.

40|$|Three main {{preventive}} principles against <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> {{were evaluated}} in this literature review, and {{the efficacy of}} each principle was estimated {{from the results of}} controlled investigations. Oral calcium drenching around calving apparently has a mean efficacy of 50 %– 60 % in terms of <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> prevention as well as prevention of <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> relapse after intravenous treatment with calcium solutions. However, some drenches have been shown to cause lesions in the forestomacs. When using the DCAD (dietary cation-anion difference) principle, feeding rations with a negative DCAD (measured as (Na + K) – (Cl + S)) significantly reduce the <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> incidence. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> from controlled experiments results in a mean RR between 0. 19 and 0. 35 when rations with a negative versus positive DCAD are compared. The main drawback from the DCAD principle is a palatability problem. The principle of feeding rations low in calcium is highly efficient in <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> prevention provided the calcium intake in the dry period is kept below 20 g per day. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> from controlled experiments results in a very low mean RR (between 0 and 0. 20) (daily calcium intake below versus above 20 g/d). The main problem in implementing the low-Ca principle is difficulties in formulating rations sufficiently low in calcium when using commonly available feeds. The use of large doses of vitamin D metabolites and analogues for <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> prevention is controversial. Due to toxicity problems and an almost total lack of recent studies on the subject this principle is not described in detail. A few management related issues were discussed briefly, and the following conclusions were made: It is important to supply the periparturient cow with sufficient magnesium to fulfil its needs, and to prevent the dry cows from being too fat.

Clinical hypocalcaemia most commonly occurs at calving and onset of lactation and {{is associated with}} <b>milk</b> <b>fever,</b> while clinical hypomagnesaemia occurs under certain dietary conditions. Factors affecting the calcium and magnesium status in dairy cows were examined in this thesis. The effect of dietary magnesium (0. 19 and 0. 43 % of dry matter) and potassium (1. 9, 2. 8, and 3. 7 % of dry matter) on magnesium digestibility and magnesium balance was assessed using a Latin square design with six lactating cows. The effect of supplying dietary calcium to dry cows (0. 49, 0. 93, and 1. 36 % of dry matter) on calcium and magnesium homeostasis was investigated in 29 periparturient cows. A case-control study was used to investigate whether mineral feeding during {{the last part of}} the dry period differed between 30 herds with high incidence of <b>milk</b> <b>fever,</b> and 22 herds with no <b>milk</b> <b>fever.</b> Finally, the effect of prepartum milking for 1 to 7 days on calcium homeostasis was investigated in 15 cows around calving. Magnesium uptake in lactating cows was found to depend on the level of dietary magnesium, but not on the potassium concentration. Dietary calcium had no effect on hypocalcaemia at calving, and was not different between herds with high <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> incidence and herds without <b>milk</b> <b>fever.</b> However, high levels of calcium in the diet resulted in decreased magnesium absorption. High amounts of potassium in the diet were associated with increased risk of high <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> incidence, while high amounts of dietary magnesium were associated with decreased risk of high <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> incidence. Prepartum milking decreased plasma calcium levels and activated the calcium homeostatic mechanisms. However, there were no differences in the degree of hypo¬calcaemia at calving, and plasma concentration of calcium decreased within 1 h after calving, indicating that factors other than milk removal alone were responsible for the decrease in plasma calcium levels at calving. The conclusion was that cows should be fed high amounts of magnesium and low amounts of potassium during {{the last part of the}} dry period to avoid <b>milk</b> <b>fever,</b> while the potassium concentration in the diet of lactating cows is of less importance regarding magnesium uptake. Milk removal affects calcium homeostasis, but the effect on the risk of <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> is unclear...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{negatively}} balanced cation-anion rations {{during the}} late dry or prepartum period requires excellent monitoring and management. The cows must {{be separated from the}} remaining herd and fed a total mixed ration as a group. Lower plasma calcium (Ca) will stimulate the Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1 -hydroxylase system to increase intestinal absorption of Ca and bone resorption &# 65533;reduce incidence of <b>milk</b> <b>fever.</b> The incidence of <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> was increased simply by increasing the potassium (K) concentration in pasture Diet high in K or sodium (Na) -alkalinize the blood - decreased bone Ca resorption and renal production of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 vitamin D, increase incidence of <b>milk</b> <b>fever.</b> Inadequate supply of magnesium (Mg) in dry period - reduce the ability of a cow to mobilize Ca at parturition.

40|$|Periparturient <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> is a {{widespread}} metabolic disease within the dairy industry, {{with a number of}} potential impacts on the affected animals’ health and productivity in the subsequent lactation that can have a considerable economic impact on farmers. This thesis aimed to investigate current attitudes of both UK dairy farmers and veterinarians towards <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> and subclinical hypocalcaemia, as well as investigating the feeding of rumen-protected rice bran during the dry period as a <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> preventative, due to its reported potential as a calcium binder, within a commercial UK dairy herd. A retrospective study was also carried out in order to investigate associations between recorded <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> events and other outcomes from farm records obtained from 78 UK dairy herds. The levels of agreement between three different blood sample types (serum, lithium heparin plasma, and lithium heparin whole blood) were also considered with regard to testing for concentrations of calcium, magnesium and phosphorous. Questionnaires were distributed to UK dairy farmers and veterinarians in order to assess current attitudes towards <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> and its prevention. When choosing a prevention strategy, farmers were most concerned with its efficacy, with its ease of use being their second priority. Veterinarians placed a greater importance on metabolic disease than farmers, and it appears that vets may have an important role in education on the subject of hypocalcaemia. A retrospective study of over 59, 000 lactations from 78 UK dairy herds found associations between recorded events of <b>milk</b> <b>fever</b> and an increased risk of dystocia, and an increased risk of a cow exiting the herd during the first 30 days of the lactation.
