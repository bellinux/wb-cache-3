This study has been designated and implemented in order to examine the situation of fatal accidents in 2011. This study was conducted on <b>mortalities</b> caused by traffic accidents in Tehran province during 2011. The information forms pertaining to traffic accident <b>mortalities</b> maintained by Forensic Medicine Organization were used to collect the data. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 16 afterwards. 82 percent of the traffic incidents <b>mortalities</b> were males and 18 percent were females.

40|$|Mass <b>mortalities</b> in bivalve {{populations have}} long been of {{particular}} concern, especially when the species supports a commercial fishery or is of conservation interest. Here we consider the evidence of mass <b>mortalities</b> of the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule (L.). Through {{the construction of a}} conceptual model eight potential factors (or groups of factors) which may cause mass <b>mortalities</b> are identified and reviewed. These include: food limitation; density; oxygen depletion and organic loadings; temperature and salinity; parasites, pathogens and commensals; toxicants and other persistent pollutants; predation, and changes in sediment, suspended solids, topography and bathymetry. The interplay between factors in recognized and discussed based on evidence mainly from the published literature relating to temperate edible cockle beds. Anecdotal evidence is also reported from a structured survey of site-specific evidence provided by fisheries managers in England and Wales. Case studies from the UK and Europe indicate that there is often no single, clear generic cause of mass <b>mortalities</b> in cockle populations. The importance of linked site-specific scientific investigations and laboratory-based experiments to fill the gaps in our current understanding of mass <b>mortalities</b> in bivalve species is highlighted as necessary to take account of both local extrinsic and intrinsic factors...|$|R
