40|$|This study {{describes}} {{a method for}} the screening of methylenedioxyamphetamine- and piperazine-derived compounds in urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These substances, characterized by possessing common moieties, are screened using precursor ion and neutral loss scan mode and then quantified in multiple reaction monitoring acquisition mode. Based on the product-ion spectra of different known molecules, chosen as model, characteristic neutral losses and product ions were selected: piperazines were detected in precursor ion scan of m/z 44 and neutral loss of 43 and 86 while amphetamines in precursor ion scan of m/z 133, 135 and 163. The applicability of the screening approach was studied in blank urine spiked with selected analytes and processed by solid-phase extraction. Linearity, matrix effect, precision, accuracy, limits of detection and limits of quantification were evaluated both for the screening and the quantification methods. The ability of the screening method to provide semi-quantitative data was demonstrated. This method {{appears to be a}} useful tool for the identification of designer drugs derived from piperazines or <b>methylenedioxyamphetamines</b> and can be potentially applied to other drug classes.

Although this methodology can provide excellent turnaround time, it is limited in its sensitivity and specificity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the amphetamine immunoassay (VITROS Chemistry AMPH reagents), on the Ortho Vitros Fusion 5, 1 FS instrument, to provide support for the University of Utah Hospital emergency department. While evaluating this system, we discovered that patient urine samples that contained high amphetamine and methamphetamine concentrations generated an error code on the instrument and no result (NR) was reported. To mimic the error code, we analyzed urine samples spiked with a range of amphetamine and methamphetamine concentrations in order to characterize this phenomenon. The amphetamine assay on the Vitros Fusion instrument is a competitive immunoassay that utilizes antibodies and drug-labeled enzyme (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase) to measure the change in absorbance at 340 nm, when the enzyme converts oxidized NAD+ to NADH (1). The assay is based on competition between amphetamines in the positive sample and the d-amphetamine or d-methamphetamine labeled-enzyme for antibody binding sites. The concentration of amphetamine/ methampehtamine in the urine sample is inversely proportional to measured enzyme activity (1).

The lowest MDLs (0. 3 - 5. 0 ng L- 1 and 1. 3 - 15. 1 ng L- 1 for river water and sewage effluent respectively) were observed using the chiral column Chirobiotic V. This is with the exception of methamphetamine and MDMA which had lower MDLs using the CBH column. However, the CBH column resulted in better resolution of enantiomers (R-s = 2. 5 for amphetamine compared with R-s = 1. 2 with Chirobiotic V). Method recovery rates were typically > 80 % for both methodologies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding the {{excretion}} of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and metabolites {{in sweat}} {{is vital for}} interpretation of sweat tests in drug treatment, criminal justice, and workplace programs. METHODS: Placebo, low (1. 0 mg/kg), and high (1. 6 mg/kg) doses of oral MDMA were given double-blind in random order to healthy volunteers (n = 15) with histories of MDMA use. Participants resided on the closed clinical research unit for up to 7 days after each dose. Volunteers wore PharmChek (R) sweat patches (n = 640) before, during, and after controlled dosing. Patches were analyzed by solid phase extraction and GC-MS for MDMA, <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine</b> (MDA), 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyamphetamine (HMA), and 4 hydroxy- 3 -methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA). Limits of quantification (LOQ) were 2. 5 ng/patch for MDMA and 5 ng/patch for HMA, HMMA, and MDA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected in 382 patches (59. 7 %), with concentrations up to 3007 ng/patch. MDA was detected in 188 patches (29. 4 %) at < 172 ng/patch, whereas no HMMA or HMA was detected; 224 patches (35. 0 %) and 60 patches (9. 4 %) were positive for MDMA and MDA, respectively, at the 25 -ng/patch threshold proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. CONCLUSIONS: Sweat testing was shown {{to be an effective}} and reliable method for monitoring MDMA use in this controlled MDMA administration study. However, variability in sweat excretion suggests that results should be interpreted qualitatively rather than quantitatively.

Osteoporosis was induced by bilateral ovariectomy. All treatments were performed for 8 weeks. The bone mineral density (BMD), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, calcium, phosphorus, superoxide dismutase (SOD), <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine</b> (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level was determined in the rat femur tissue. The gene and protein expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot, respectively. The BMD, SOD and GSH⁃Px levels, and the expression of OPG were significantly lower in osteoporosis compared to control group (all p < 0. 05). The serum levels of osteocalcin, ALP, and MDA, and the expression of RANKL were significantly higher in osteoporosis compared to control group (all p < 0. 05). Berberine, especially the high doses of berberine, effectively increased SOD, GSH⁃Px, and OPG levels as well as decreased serum osteocalcin, ALP, MDA and RANKL levels in berberine-treated osteoporosis groups (all p < 0. 05).

The ELISA was developed using saliva as the matrix. During the screening stage of the production of these antibodies, particular attention was given to their cross reactivity profiles. Among the molecules tested for cross-reactivity, were legally available medications such as ephedrine, as other commercially available antibodies show cross reactivity. The resulting monoclonal antibodies detected amphetamine and other designer derivatives, and showed negligible cross reactivity with the legal structurally related molecules. The antibodies were applied to a biosensor (BIAcore) assay for the detection of amphetamine and methamphetamine in saliva samples. The affinity constants for the antibodies were determined by ELISA and BIAcore methods. The values obtained were found to be similar by both methods. A novel automated prototype device, developed by our collaborators, Envitec, was optimised and the anti-THC polyclonal antibody was applied to it for the screening of saliva samples for the presence of THC.

Detection of certain derivatives, such as methcathinone, by commonly available immunoassay screening techniques is insufficient. Multi-analyte confirmations for amphetamine type stimulants are therefore required, but traditional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods necessitate lengthy analytical procedures with prolonged sample turn-around times. A validated rapid GC–MS assay for urinary confirmation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, ephedrine, norephedrine, <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine,</b> methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine and N-methyl- 1 -(3, 4 methylenedioxyphenyl) - 2 -butanamine is reported.

Analytes were separated {{in less than}} 3 min and quantified simultaneously by selected-ionmonitoring using stable isotope substituted internal standards. The total instrument cycle-time was 6 min per sample. The limits of detection were between 1. 5 ng/mL and 6. 25 ng/mL for the various analytes. Intermediate precision and accuracy were {{in the range of}} 6. 3 – 13. 8 % and 90. 5 – 107. 3 % for the respective analytes at the lower limit of quantitation, and between 5. 8 – 12. 6 % and 95. 4 – 103. 1 % for the high control. Long-term storage of methcathinone positive specimens at - 20 º C proved insufficient stability of this analyte. The proposed assay is precise and accurate for confirmation of amphetamine and derivatives in urine. The complementary approach of extractive-derivatization and fast GC–MS analysis is especially applicable in routine clinical settings where reduced sample turnaround times are required. Further investigation of cathinone as a possible metabolite of methcathinone is warranted, based on results from analyzed authentic urine samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{abuse of}} the {{designer}} amphetamines such as 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) is increasing throughout the world. They have become popular drugs, especially at all-night techno dance parties (Raves), and their detection is becoming an important issue. Presently, there are no MDMA- or MDA-specific immunoassays on the market, and detection of the designer amphetamines is dependent upon the use of commercially available amphetamine assays. The success of this approach {{has been difficult to}} assess because of the general unavailability of significant numbers of samples from known drug users. The objectives of the present study are to characterize the drug content of urine samples from admitted Ecstasy users by chromatographic methods and to assess the ability of the available amphetamine/methamphetamine immunoassays to detect methylenedioxyamphetamines. We found that, when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD), 64 % of 70 urine samples (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [GC-MS]: 88 % of 64 urine samples) obtained from Rave attendees contained MDMA and/or 3, 4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) alone or in combination with amphetamine, methamphetamine, or other designer amphetamines such as 3, 4 -methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA). This suggests {{that the majority of the}} Ravers are multi-drug users. At the manufacturer's suggested cutoffs, the Abbott TDx Amphetamine/Methamphetamine II and the new Roche HS Amphetamine/MDMA assays demonstrated greater detection sensitivity for MDMA than the other amphetamine immunoassays tested (Abuscreen OnLine Hitachi AMPS, Abuscreen OnLine Integra AMPS, Abuscreen OnLine Integra AMPSX, CEDIA AMPS, and EMIT II AMPS). There is 100 % agreement between each of the two immunoassays with the reference chromatographic methods, HPLC-DAD and GC-MS, for the detection of <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} amphetamine and amphetamine analogues has been jeopardized {{by a number}} of side effects and toxicity, partly due to complex mechanisms of action. While some of the analogues have been individually characterised, there is still need for comparative studies, in particular, on their efficacy to release dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine, further enlightening some of the synaptic mechanisms conveying their actions. Thus, we have compared four alkoxyamphetamine derivatives, i. e., p-methoxyamphetamine; p-methoxymethamphetamine; <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine,</b> methylene-dioxymethamphetamine, using methamphetamine, and D-amphetamine, as reference substances, on rotational behaviour and releasing mechanisms studied with in vivo microdialysis in rats. All alkoxylated-derivatives produced a long-lasting rotational behaviour at 10 mg/kg s. c., but the reference substances produced a strong rotation already at 2 mg/kg s. c. in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. At the concentration of 100 mu M, the alkoxylated-derivatives were equipotent to evoke dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release in rat neostriatum, while D-amphetamine and methamphetamine were more efficient on dopamine release. Pre-treatment with methamphetamine or the alkoxylated-derivatives produced a remarkable decrease of the effect of K+-depolarisation on both dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release. The insertion of a methoxy or a methylenedioxy group on the benzene ring of D-amphetamine or methamphetamine, or N-methylation of the D-amphetamine molecule alters the selectivity of the compounds. The efficacy of the alkoxylated-derivatives on dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release was similar, but stimulated less dopamine release and produced less rotational behaviour than D-amphetamine and methamphetamine. The lower efficacy of K+-depolarisation following pre-treatments with the derivatives suggests an impairment of releasable monoamine stores. The present observations can enlighten the mechanisms of action of drugs showing a high risk for abuse among young populations...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en el congreso 16 th International Symposium on Advances in Extraction Technologies, ExTech, celebrado en Chania, Creta, Grecia, del 25 al 28 de mayo de 2014 Overall, {{pollution}} {{by drugs}} of abuse {{at very low}} concentrations appears to be broad in environmental compartments near populated areas. This situation could bring about potential risks for human health and ecosystems. There are several direct and indirect pathways through which drugs of abuse can be introduced into the aqueous environment [1, 2]. However, insufficiently treated municipal wastewater discharge is identified as the route responsible for surface water contamination [3]. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimization a methodology to obtain a valid method for the extraction and determination these compounds in waste and surface waters. A reliable method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) has been developed for the simultaneous detection, identification and quantification of 15 drugs of abuse, such as heroin (HER), methadone (METH), morphine (MORP), amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MAMP), ethylamphetamine (EAMP), methylphenidate (MPHE), ephedrine (EPH), cocaine (COC), benzoylecgonine (BE), 3, 4 <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine</b> (MDA) and 3, 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), bufotenine (BUF), ketamine (KET) and 4 -Methoxyphencyclidine (MPCP). Recoveries were evaluated at different water pHs to determine the optimal for the simultaneous analysis of these drugs. The validated method was applied to analyze waste and surface water. Samples were collected at 25 sites through the Turia River Basin in 2012 and at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of Quart-Benàger and Pinedo I and II in 2013. These plants treat most of the residual water from Valencia city, which is the 3 er largest city in Spain. The recoveries for these compounds ranging from 67. 5 to 138. 2...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the {{prevalence}} of legal party pills in New Zealand has risen dramatically. These pills contain new piperazine designer drugs, two of the more common being 1 -benzylpiperazine (BZP) and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). This thesis describes an optimised LC-MS/MS method {{for the detection of}} BZP and TFMPP in whole blood, using an automated solid phase extraction (SPE) for sample clean-up. The method was validated on three different days using five replicate samples each day. The standard curve was linear from 7 - 7000 ng/mL for BZP and 10 - 10, 000 ng/mL for TFMPP, with coefficients of variation (CV) below 10 %, and accuracy greater than 90 % for both drugs. The method was used to quantitate samples provided by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. Blood levels were used to show concentrations in the blood over time, and relate these to performance of subjects on a driving simulator. The study was stopped after 41 % of the participants who received BZP and TFMPP had adverse reactions to the pills, including vomiting and migraines. The LC-MS/MS method was also used to detect and quantitate methamphetamine, amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, <b>methylenedioxyamphetamine,</b> morphine, codeine and 6 -monoacetylmorphine in hair. The drugs were extracted from 20 mg of hair using hydrochloric acid in a water bath overnight, then purified using SPE. Validation on three days with five replicate samples gave coefficients of variation (CV) below 12 % and acceptable accuracy for all drugs. The method was tested on three samples, previously reported by Environmental Science and Research (ESR) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) giving results in good agreement. This thesis describes a sensitive, accurate, reproducible LC-MS/MS method easily adapted to analyse drugs of abuse in different biological matrices. It demonstrates the versatility of LC-MS/MS and its applications in forensic work...|$|E
