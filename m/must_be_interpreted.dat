25|$|Some Muslims take a relativist {{approach}} to hijab. They {{believe that the}} commandment to maintain modesty <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{with regard to the}} surrounding society. What is considered modest or daring in one society might not be considered so in another. It is important, they say, for believers to wear clothing that communicates modesty and reserve.|$|E
25|$|Habitability {{indicators}} and biosignatures <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> within a planetary and environmental context. In determining the habitability {{potential of a}} body, studies focus on its bulk composition, orbital properties, atmosphere, and potential chemical interactions. Stellar characteristics of importance include mass and luminosity, stable variability, and high metallicity. Rocky, wet terrestrial-type planets and moons {{with the potential for}} Earth-like chemistry are a primary focus of astrobiological research, although more speculative habitability theories occasionally examine alternative biochemistries and other types of astronomical bodies.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{studies have}} been {{utilised}} {{in the study of}} pre-historic population movements. On the whole, scientists agree that there is evidence for a migration during the Neolithic. However, they cannot agree on the extent of this movement. The conclusions of studies appear to be 'operator dependent'. That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and conclusions are drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> with caution.|$|E
25|$|If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in {{the domain}} of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are {{in the domain of}} the other, the {{structure}} is potentially ambiguous. If neither QE {{is in the}} domain of the other, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> independently. These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, that every boy left upset a teacher, it cannot be interpreted as for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset {{by the fact that the}} boy left. The only available interpretation is that one single teacher was upset.|$|E
25|$|The {{mosaic of}} the victorious charioteer is younger than these works. It {{dates from the}} second half of the 4th century CE, and {{features}} the phrase Eros omnia per te (Eros everything for you). The depiction of the charioteer shows great attention to realism, as do the depictions of the horses, two of which are named Amandus and Frunitus after their characters. The horses are arranged symmetrically; such symmetries were very popular at the time. The charioteer is holding a whip, a crown made of branches and a palm branch. The starting blocks of the circus can be seen in the background. This work of art was found in a private residence and it appears that it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a monument donated by the owner celebrating the victory of a charioteer named Eros.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{since the}} {{gravitational}} potential {{is linked to}} the wave-function in the picture of the Schrödinger–Newton equation, the wave-function <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a real object. Therefore, at least in principle, it becomes a measurable quantity. Making use of the nonlocal nature of entangled quantum systems, this could be used to send signals faster than light, which is generally thought to be in contradiction with causality. It is, however, not clear if this problem can be resolved by applying the right collapse prescription, yet to be found, consistently to the full quantum system. Also, since gravity is such a weak interaction, {{it is not clear that}} such an experiment can be actually performed within the parameters given in our universe (cf. the discussion about a similar thought experiment proposed by Eppley and Hannah).|$|E
25|$|Further, the United States {{government}} {{passed the}} Radio Act of 1912. This act, {{along with the}} International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, {{so as not to}} miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations. In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{tests can}} be {{performed}} to assess the cardiovascular status of the patient. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) {{is a measure of}} hydration status, with a value 45% being considered significant. Increasing values over repeated examination are also considered significant. The total protein (TP) of blood may also be measured, as an aid in estimating the amount of protein loss into the intestine. Its value <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> along with the PCV, {{to take into account the}} hydration status. When laboratory tests are not available, hydration can be crudely assessed by tenting the skin of the neck or eyelid, looking for sunken eyes, depression, high heart rate, and feeling for tackiness of the gums. Jugular filling and quality of the peripheral pulses can be used to approximate blood pressure. Capillary refill time (CRT) may be decreased early in the colic, but generally prolongs as the disease progresses and cardiovascular status worsens.|$|E

25|$|When a piece {{occurs in}} both tai shogi and maka dai dai shogi, it moves and {{promotes}} the same way. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a'. Directional modifiers on continuation legs <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> relative to the previous leg, where 'f' means 'continue in the same direction'; default is 'all directions'. The default modality of the final leg is the usual 'mc', but on non-final legs also includes a hop over an obstacle at their end-point, provided the path does not bend back onto itself there. Other (combinations of) modalities must be written explicitly. U denotes the universal leaper, a piece which can jump to any square on the board except the one that it is on.|$|E
25|$|In (36a), {{the empty}} pronoun ø {{is able to}} refer to any entity. However, the {{preferred}} reading is {{for it to be}} interpreted as a variable bound to the quantifier mei ge ren (or everyone). In contrast, the ta (he) in sentence (36b) is unable to have a bound variable interpretation, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as referring to some other third party. Huang states that this is because the empty pronoun construction (36a) is possible, and so it is preferred as the construction that carries the bound variable interpretation. This explanation is made as an extension of a claim put forward by Chomsky in his theory of anaphora, which states that where empty pronouns and overt pronouns are both able {{to be used as a}} reference, languages will prefer to use the empty pronoun. This implies that, since English does not have an empty pronoun available in the above examples, the overt pronoun he is used to refer to the quantifier everybody. However, since the empty pronoun is available in Mandarin, using it is preferred when the pronoun in the sentence is meant to corefer with everybody, as in (36a).|$|E
25|$|Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") {{refers to}} {{definition}} from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead {{which is not}} found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by {{the help of a}} third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.|$|E
