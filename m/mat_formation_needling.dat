40|$|<b>Mat</b> <b>formation</b> in the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a surface-associated {{phenomenon}} in which yeast cells {{spread over the}} surface of a low-density agar petri plate as a complex film. This spreading growth occurs by sliding motility and is dependent on the adhesion protein (adhesin) Flo 11 p. In order to identify molecular pathways that govern <b>mat</b> <b>formation,</b> whole-genome transcriptional profiling was used to compare cells growing as a mat to cells growing in a suspension culture (planktonic cells). This analysis revealed that S. cerevisiae upregulates a subset of genes in response to growth on a surface. These genes included the INO 1 gene, which encodes the myo-inositol- 1 -phosphate synthase, which carries out the rate-limiting step in inositol biosynthesis. Further inquiry revealed that a transcription factor that controls INO 1 expression, called Opi 1 p, participates in the regulation of <b>mat</b> <b>formation.</b> Opi 1 p appears to modulate <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> by influencing the expression of FLO 11. The opi 1 Δ mutant was found to exhibit reduced FLO 11 levels. Consequently, the opi 1 Δ mutant perturbs the FLO 11 -dependent phenotype of invasive growth. The opi 1 Δ mutant's defects in <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> and invasive growth are dependent on the transcriptional activator Ino 2 p. These results indicate that Opi 1 p affects <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> and invasive growth by participating in the regulation of FLO 11...|$|R
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae generates complex biofilms called mats on low-density (0. 3 %) agar plates. The mats can be morphologically {{divided into}} two regions: (i) hub, the {{interior}} region characterized {{by the presence of}} wrinkles and channels, and (ii) rim, the smooth periphery. <b>Formation</b> of <b>mats</b> depends on the adhesin Flo 11 p, which is also required for invasive growth, a phenotype in which the S. cerevisiae yeasts grow as chains of cells that dig into standard-density (2 %) agar plates.

40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} used as a model for fungal biofilm {{formation}} due to its ability to adhere to plastic surfaces and to form mats on low-density agar petri plates. Mats are complex multicellular structures composed of a network of cables that form a central hub from which emanate multiple radial spokes. This reproducible and elaborate pattern is indicative of a highly regulated developmental program that depends on specific transcriptional programming, environmental cues, and possibly cell–cell communication systems. While biofilm formation and sliding motility were shown to be strictly dependent on the cell-surface adhesin Flo 11 p, little is known about the cellular machinery that controls <b>mat</b> <b>formation.</b> Here we show that Hsp 70 molecular chaperones play key roles in this process with the assistance of the nucleotide exchange factors Fes 1 p and Sse 1 p and the Hsp 40 family member Ydj 1 p. The disruption of these cofactors completely abolished <b>mat</b> <b>formation.</b> Furthermore, complex interactions among SSA genes were observed: <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> depended mostly on SSA 1 while minor defects were observed upon loss of SSA 2; additional mutations in SSA 3 or SSA 4 further enhanced these phenotypes.

Circulating adiponectin increases in lean {{states such as}} caloric restriction (CR), but {{the reasons for this}} paradox remain unclear. Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases during CR, and both MAT and serum adiponectin increase in many other clinical conditions. Thus, we investigated whether MAT contributes to circulating adiponectin. We find that adiponectin secretion is greater from MAT than WAT. Notably, specific inhibition of <b>MAT</b> <b>formation</b> in mice results in decreased circulating adiponectin during CR despite unaltered adiponectin expression in WAT. Inhibiting <b>MAT</b> <b>formation</b> also alters skeletal muscle adaptation to CR, suggesting that MAT exerts systemic effects.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on seven {{publications}} dealing with separation processes applied in the manufacturing of chemical pulp. The first part discusses the correlation of mass transfer phenomena in the ultrafiltration of spent cooking liquor. The second part focuses on the fiber <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> {{that takes place in}} pulp washers and thickeners. The main interest throughout the thesis is to develop useful and scientifically justified methods for correlating mass transfer and filtration mechanisms in order to interpret the phenomena taking place in the studied unit operations. The methods presented can be used in the designing and dimensioning of industrial-scale equipment and systems. Two types of basic mass transfer models, the film model and a more complete approach utilizing an integral solution for two-dimensional diffusion, have been introduced for the calculation of the macrosolute concentration at the surface of the ultrafiltration membrane. A pilot-scale test rig was used to measure ultrafiltration of spent cooking liquor. Mass transfer correlations to estimate the permeate flux have been developed based on both models to be used for plant design calculations. The modeling studies indicated that the integral solution method gave a physically more realistic behavior for the macrosolute concentration at the membrane wall than the widely used film model. It was further shown that dynamic programming may be effectively used to optimize a multistage industrial-scale ultrafiltration-diafiltration process. This method required a shorter calculation time and resulted in slightly better optimal conditions than the direct search algorithm. The studies on <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> during pulp washing showed that the washing tester is a useful tool to obtain the required information for the washer. A calculation procedure has been developed to obtain design parameters for the dimensioning of industrial pulp washers. The suggested theory was based on Darcy's law under the conditions of constant pressure filtration of incompressible beds and reasonable accuracy was obtained for purposes of washer design. A more accurate approach for the modeling of the <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> stage was formulated on the fundamental filtration theory of compressible fiber beds. Two such methods were discussed. In the more general model of <b>mat</b> <b>formation,</b> the equation of continuity during filtration was also taken into account. This model was then used for evaluating the effect of various operational parameters on drum washer performance. This model was also able to predict earlier generated experimental test data rather well.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae to form morphologically complex colony-like {{structures}} called mats requires {{expression of the}} cell surface glycoprotein Flo 11 p and growth on a semisolid surface.

50|$|Time lapse {{photography}} {{of modern}} microbial <b>mat</b> <b>formation</b> {{in a laboratory}} setting gives some revealing clues to the behavior of cyanobacteria in stromatolites. Biddanda et al. (2015) found that cyanobacteria exposed to localized beams of light moved towards the light, or expressed phototaxis, and increased their photosynthetic yield, which is necessary for survival. In a novel experiment, the scientists projected a school logo onto a petri dish containing the organisms, which accreted beneath the lighted region, forming the logo in bacteria. The authors speculate that such motility allows the cyanobacteria to seek light sources to support the colony. In both light and dark conditions, the cyanobacteria form clumps that then expand outwards, with individual members remaining connected to the colony via long tendrils. This may be a protective mechanism that affords evolutionary benefit to the colony in harsh environments where mechanical forces act to tear apart the microbial mats. Thus these sometimes elaborate structures, constructed by microscopic organisms working somewhat in unison, are a means of providing shelter and protection from a harsh environment.|$|R

The attachment densities were high on hydrophobic surfaces such as polytetrafluoroethylene and very low on substrata with surface free energy over 40 - 50 [*]mJ/m². Using a thermodynamic approach, the free energy of adhesion of the diatom to the five substrata was determined, and led to a very strong correlation with attachment densities for polytetrafluoroethylene, polyamide, polyethylene, and stainless steel...|$|R
