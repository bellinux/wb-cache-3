50|$|<b>Modacrylic</b> is a {{modified}} acrylic fiber that contains at least 35% and at most 85% acrylonitrile monomer. The comonomers vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride or vinyl bromide used in <b>modacrylic</b> give the fiber flame retardant properties. End-uses of <b>modacrylic</b> include faux fur, wigs, hair extensions and protective clothing.|$|E
50|$|Current <b>modacrylic</b> fiber {{producers}} include Kaneka Corporation in Japan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modacrylics</b> {{are also}} used in fleece, knit-pile fabric backings, and {{nonwoven}} fabrics. Other uses of <b>modacrylics</b> include paint rollers, industrial fabrics, stuffed toys and filters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Modacrylics</b> {{are poor}} {{conductors}} of heat. The fabrics are soft, warm and resilient but {{are prone to}} pilling and matting. <b>Modacrylics</b> display high performance {{when it comes to}} appearance retention. The fibers are quite resilient and will not wrinkle. They also have great dimensional stability and high elastic recovery, which gives them the ability to hold their shape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Modacrylics</b> {{are used}} {{primarily}} in applications where environmental resistance or flame retardancy is necessary or required. <b>Modacrylics</b> {{have the ability}} to combine flame retardancy with a relatively low density, meaning protective gear is not uncomfortably heavy (i.e. shirts and trousers worn by electrical linemen). The combination of flame retardancy and low density is also useful in furnishings, draperies, and outdoor fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{production}} of <b>modacrylic</b> fiber began in 1949 by Union Carbide Corporation in the United States. <b>Modacrylic</b> and acrylic fibers {{are similar in}} composition and at one time {{were in the same}} category. In 1960 the Federal Trade Commission decided to separate the two fibers and establish a category for each.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>modacrylic</b> has {{properties}} {{that are similar}} to an acrylic. However, modacrylics are flame retardant and do not combust. The fibers are difficult to ignite and will self-extinguish. In addition to a modacrylic's flame retardant properties it has a relatively high durability that is comparable to wool. <b>Modacrylic</b> fibers have a moderate resistance to abrasion and a very low tenacity.|$|E

30|$|Barrier {{materials}} {{constructed of}} natural fibers (e.g., cotton) often produce a fire blocking char upon exposure to heat and/or flames. Cellulosic fabrics require chemical treatment (e.g., boric acid) {{in order to}} yield excellent fire resistance. FR treatment {{can be applied to}} the final fabric as a coating, or FR chemicals can be introduced during fiber formation to alter the polymer structure (e.g., FR rayon fiber with polysilicic acid backbone). The FR rayon is generally used in upholstered furniture applications when combined with <b>modacrylics,</b> aramids, and wool fibers. For mattress applications, FR rayon fibers are usually blended with polyester fibers to form highloft battings. When exposed to heat, the FR rayon decomposes endothermically and forms a silicate-containing protective char ([Horrocks 1996]). The low melt polyester fiber melts holds the protective char in place ([Dennis ML 2999]).|$|R
40|$|Manufactured fibers {{comprise}} {{a broad spectrum}} of products with an almost endless potential for engineering in specific physical, chemical and aesthetic properties. World fiber consumption is about 40 + % cotton; 40 + % polyester; 7 - 8 % nylon, with all the other fibers representing only about 10 % of the total (Table 1). So it is obvious that both cotton and polyester are very important, whether used alone or together. Historically, fiber manufacturers and cotton producers have focused on the competitive aspects of the marketplace. However, there have also been notable successes for materials containing both fiber types. When mixed in intimate blends, the advantages of different fiber types can be combined to yield superior fabric properties. Cotton/polyester blend fabrics are the quintessential example of utilizing the best attributes of both fibers to produce fabrics with price, performance and aesthetics not achievable with either fiber alone. Similarly, flame resistant fabrics and high-loft battings have been developed using the char forming ability of FR cotton enhanced by the flame poisoning ability of <b>modacrylics</b> and/or FR polyesters. And more complex ternary and quaternary fiber blends are in use to produc...|$|R

50|$|The Federal Trade Commission defines <b>modacrylic</b> fibers as {{manufactured}} fibers {{in which}} the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of less than 85%, but at least 35% weight acrylonitrile units except when the polymer qualifies as rubber.|$|E
5000|$|Fake fur is {{made from}} several {{materials}} including blends of acrylic and <b>modacrylic</b> polymers derived from coal, air, water, petroleum and limestone. These materials can {{take a long time}} to break down, possibly anywhere from 500 to 1,000 years.|$|E
50|$|Modacrylics are {{sensitive}} to loss of appearance due to improper care; therefore, {{it is important to}} know how to care for modacrylics. Modacrylics are resistant to acids, weak alkalis, and organic solvents. These fibers are also resistant to moths, mildew and sunlight. <b>Modacrylic</b> fabrics can be machine washed using warm water and tumble dried on a low setting. <b>Modacrylic</b> pieces can also be dry-cleaned, however, they should not be steamed and should only be tumbled on cold. Some fabrics may also be cleaned using the furrier method (a special non immersion cleaning process). The fibers are heat sensitive and will shrink at 250 °F and will stiffen at temperatures over 300 °F.|$|E
5000|$|Modacrylics are creamy {{or white}} and are {{produced}} in tow and staple form.

50|$|The {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} fibres used in manufacturing fibre grew steadily throughout the 20th century. In the 1920s, the computer was invented; in the 1940s, acetate, <b>modacrylic,</b> metal fibres, and saran were developed; acrylic, polyester, and spandex were introduced in the 1950s. Polyester became hugely popular in the apparel market, and by the late 1970s, more polyester was sold in the United States than cotton.|$|E
50|$|A <b>modacrylic</b> is a {{synthetic}} copolymer. Modacrylics are soft, strong, resilient, and dimensionally stable. They {{can be easily}} dyed, show good press and shape retention, and are quick to dry. They have outstanding resistance to chemicals and solvents, are not attacked by moths or mildew, and are nonallergenic. Among their uses are in apparel linings, furlike outerwear, paint-roller covers, scatter rugs, carpets, and work clothing and as hair in wigs.|$|E
5000|$|Wet {{spinning}} is {{the oldest}} of the five processes. This process is used for polymers that need to be dissolved in a solvent to be spun. The spinneret is submerged in a chemical bath that causes the fiber to precipitate, and then solidify, as it emerges. The process gets its name from this [...] "wet" [...] bath. Acrylic, rayon, aramid, <b>modacrylic,</b> and spandex are produced via this process.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{spinning}} is {{also used}} for polymers that must be dissolved in solvent. It differs in that the solidification is achieved through evaporation of the solvent. This is usually achieved by a stream of air or inert gas. Because there is no precipitating liquid involved, the fiber {{does not need to}} be dried, and the solvent is more easily recovered. Acetate, triacetate, acrylic, <b>modacrylic,</b> polybenzimidazole fiber, spandex, and vinyon are produced via this process.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century hairdressers in England and France did a brisk {{business}} supplying postiches, or pre-made small wiglets, curls, and false buns to be incorporated into the hairstyle. The use of postiches did not diminish even as women's hair grew shorter in the decade between 1910 and 1920, but they seem to have gone out of fashion during the 1920s.In the 1960s a new type of synthetic wig was developed using a <b>modacrylic</b> fiber which made wigs more affordable. Reid-Meredith was a pioneer in the sales of these types of wigs.|$|E

40|$|Astronaut {{clothes for}} {{exploration}} missions beyond low Earth orbit need to satisfy several challenges not {{met by the}} currently-used mostly-cotton clothing. A laundering system {{is not expected to}} be available, and thus soiled garments must be trashed. Jettisoning waste does not seem feasible at this time. The cabin oxygen concentration is expected to be higher than standard, and thus fabrics must better resist ignition and burning. Fabrics need to be identified that reduce logistical mass, that can be worn longer before disposal, that are at least as comfortable as cotton, and that resist ignition or that char immediately after ignition. Human factors and psychology indicate that crew well-being and morale require a variety of colors and styles to accommodate personal identity and preferences. Over the past four years, the Logistics Reduction Project under NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems Program has sponsored the Advanced Clothing System Task to conduct several ground studies and one ISS study. These studies have evaluated length of wear and personal preferences of commercially-available exercise- and routine-wear garments made from several fabrics (cotton, polyester, Merino wool, and <b>modacrylic),</b> woven and knitted. Note that Merino wool and <b>modacrylic</b> char like cotton in ambient air, while polyester unacceptably melts. This paper focuses on the two components of an International Space Station study, onboard and on the ground, with astronauts and cosmonauts. Fabrics were randomized to participants. Length of wear was assessed by statistical survival analysis, and preference by exact binomial confidence limits. Merino wool and <b>modacrylic</b> t-shirts were worn longer on average than polyester t-shirts. Interestingly, self-assessed preferences were inconsistent with length-of-wear behavior, as polyester was preferred to Merino wool and <b>modacrylic...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} {{concerns}} that fire-derived acid gases could aggravate thermal burns for individuals wearing synthetic flame retardant garments. A comparative risk assessment {{was performed on}} three commercial flame retardant materials with regard to relative hazards associated with acidic combustion gases to skin during a full engulfment flash fire event. The tests were performed in accordance with ASTM F 1930 and ISO 13506 : Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection against Fire Simulations Using an Instrumented Manikin. Three fire retardant textiles were tested: an FR treated cotton/nylon blend, a low Protex® <b>modacrylic</b> blend, and a medium Protex® <b>modacrylic</b> blend. The materials, {{in the form of}} whole body coveralls, were subjected to propane-fired flash conditions of 84 kW/m 2 in a full sized simulator for a duration of either 3 or 4 s. Ion traps consisting of wetted sodium carbonate-impregnated cellulose in Teflon holders were placed on the chest and back both above and under the standard undergarments. The ion traps remained in position from the time of ignition until 5 min post ignition. Results indicated that acid deposition did increase with <b>modacrylic</b> content from 0. 9 μmol/cm 2 for the cotton/nylon, to 12 μmol/cm 2 for the medium <b>modacrylic</b> blend. The source of the acidity was dominated by hydrogen chloride. Discoloration was inversely proportional to the amount of acid collected on the traps. A risk assessment was performed on the potential adverse impact of acid gases on both the skin and open wounds. The results indicated that the deposition and dissolution of the acid gases in surficial fluid media (perspiration and blood plasma) resulted in an increase in acidity, but not sufficient to induce irritation/skin corrosion or to cause necrosis in open third degree burns...|$|E

40|$|All human space {{missions}} require significant logistical {{mass and}} volume that add an unprecedented burden on longduration missions beyond low-Earth orbit. For these missions with limited cleaning resources, a new wardrobe {{must be developed}} to reduce this logistical burden by reducing clothing mass and extending clothing wear. The present studies have been undertaken, for the first time, to measure length of wear and to assess the acceptance of such extended wear. Garments in these studies are commercially available exercise T-shirts and shorts, routine-wear T-shirts, and longsleeved pullover shirts. Fabric composition (cotton, polyester, light-weight, superfine Merino wool, <b>modacrylic,</b> cotton/rayon, polyester/Cocona, modacrylic/Xstatic, modacrylic/rayon, modacrylic/lyocell/aramid), construction (open knit, tight knit, open weave, tight weave), and finishing treatment (none, quaternary ammonium salt) are the independent variables. Eleven studies are reported here: five studies of exercise T-shirts, three of exercise shorts, two of routine wear Tshirts, and one of shirts used as sleep-wear. All studies are conducted in a climate-controlled environment, similar to a space vehicle's. For exercise clothing, study participants wear the garments during aerobic exercise. For routine wear clothing, study participants wear the T-shirts daily in an office or laboratory. Daily questionnaires collected data on ordinal preferences of nine sensory elements and on reason for retiring a used garment. Study 1 compares knitted cotton, polyester, and Merino exercise T-shirts (61 participants), study 2, knitted polyester, <b>modacrylic,</b> and polyester/Cocona exercise T-shirts (40 participants), study 3, cotton and polyester exercise shorts, knitted and woven (70 participants), all three using factorial experimental designs with and without a finishing treatment, conducted at the Johnson Space Center, sharing study participants. Study 4 compares knitted polyester and ZQ Merino exercise T-shirts, study 5, knitted ZQ Merino and <b>modacrylic</b> routine-wear T-shirts, with study 6 using only knitted polyester exercise shorts. No finishing treatment is used. Studies 4 and 5 use cross-over experimental designs, and all three studies were conducted aboard the ISS with six crew. Studies 4 and 6 were repeated {{on the ground with}} the same participants to learn if perception was affected microgravity. Study 7 is a longer-term, single-blind panel study of knitted routine-wear undershirts with at least 12 participants to assess tolerance to Merino by comparing it with a cotton/rayon blends, using a cross-over design, eliminating carryover effects with wash-out periods between shirts...|$|E

The initial focus has been exercise clothing since the use period is lower. Various ground studies and an ISS technology demonstration have been conducted to evaluate clothing preference and length of wear. The analysis indicates that use of ACS selected garments (e. g. wool, <b>modacrylic,</b> polyester) can increase the breakeven point for laundry to 300 days...|$|E
30|$|The latest {{development}} in nonwoven barrier fabrics is the siliconized thermally bonded highloft barrier material. The siliconized highloft is {{a blend of}} three different types of siliconized fibers (e.g., Basofil®, Tencel® and Protex®) held together with a low-melt polyester ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Each component of the blend provides a specific and necessary functionality to the barrier material. The siliconized melamine fibers provide a non-shrinking form of carbon, whereas the regenerated cellulosic fiber improves the softness and water repellency of the blend. The regenerated cellulosic fiber is very cost effective and can be used to increase the bulk of the product. Siliconized <b>modacrylic</b> fiber, when used in an appropriate blend ratio, can reduce the local oxygen content within the barrier during a fire, thereby prolonging char oxidation. The low melt polyester provides resiliency to the barrier, and its strong thermoplastic character helps to maintain the structural integrity of the char formed.|$|E
