5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E

50|$|A {{limited edition}} {{book is a}} book that is {{released}} in a limited quantity print run, usually much smaller than publishing industry standards, usually less than 1000 copies.

50|$|Shingles {{are less}} durable than shakes, {{particularly}} in wet climates; shakes are {{finished with a}} drawknife or similar tool which leaves a smooth surface that resists water penetration, and this in turn slows the softening of wood by microorganisms. Also, the method of splitting shakes rather than sawing ensures only straight-grained pieces (which are <b>much</b> stronger and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> warp).|$|R

50|$|In {{contemporary}} Tahitian {{the right}} word is pāreu (singular: te pāreu, plural: te mau pāreu), with the pronunciation of the word with a long a (hold the sound for two beats rather than just one) and the e and u pronounced separately, rather than slurred into a diphthong. It is not clear where the variant pareo comes from. It might be an old dialectic variant or an early explorers' misinterpretation. But both terms were already used in the 19th century (the Dutch geographic magazine De Aarde en haar Volken of 1887 had a few South-seas articles, some of them using pāreu, others pareo).

25|$|There is a {{scientific}} consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk {{to human health}} than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested {{on a case-by-case basis}} before introduction.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{large-scale}} field experiment to investigate how Chinese firms respond to Internet job board applications from ethnic minority and Han applicants. We signal ethnicity by using names that are typically Han Chinese and distinctively Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uighur. We find {{significant differences in}} callback rates by ethnicity. These differences vary systematically across ethnic groups. Not all firms discriminate-approximately half treat all candidates equally. State-owned firms are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than others <b>to</b> discriminate in favor of Han candidates and both state- and foreign-owned firms are significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> treat candidates equally than do privately owned firms...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} that reconciles the co-existence of high income mobility among people on low income and patterns of high persistence on income support among people whose income from government payments is low – both phenomena have been founded in different Australian studies. We find that these phenomena are evident in data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, but that they reflect the experiences of different groups of individuals. These groups of individuals are around the same size. While there is considerable mobility in income from the lowest two deciles of household equivalised income, this mobility is greater for those not reliant on welfare {{for the majority of}} their income than for those who are. The non-welfare reliant individuals appear to have substantially different characteristics compared with those in the (more disadvantaged) welfare reliant group, being <b>much</b> younger, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suffer from a long-term health condition, more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be full-time students and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been divorced than the welfare reliant group. welfare reliance, income mobility, public transfers...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} find out what the chances are of a patient with a {{positive}} or negative test result having or not having the disease, the likelihood ratios (LRs) need to be calculated. The LR incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and provides an estimate of how much a positive or negative test result changes the chances of having or not having the disease. So a positive LR tells you how much more <b>likely</b> patients are <b>to</b> have the disease when the test is positive. The negative LR tells you how <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> patients are <b>to</b> have the disease when the test is negative.|$|R
40|$|To assess racial {{differences}} {{in the use of}} oral anticoagulant therapy for patients with heart failure, we conducted a cohort study of 30 hospitals in northeast Ohio. For 12, 911 Medicare enrollees consecutively admitted in 1992 through 1994 with heart failure, crude and adjusted odds of being on oral anticoagulation were determined. The crude and adjusted odds of being African Americans on oral anticoagulant therapy relative to whites were 0. 57 (95 % confidence interval 0. 47 – 0. 69) and 0. 55 (95 % confidence interval 0. 45 – 0. 67), respectively.

25|$|In {{spite of}} these arguments, a {{significant}} proportion of Valencian population refuse to identify Valencian with Catalan. This phenomenon is known as blaverism. This position is often held by those who use Castilian more commonly than Valencian or do not use the latter fluently as well as promote Spanish nationalism and oppose Catalan independence.

25|$|Lint {{contamination}} {{also presents}} {{what may be}} the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices. In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering clean rooms are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer and thicker, and therefore <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> shed any material. Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like spandex (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven polyolefin fibers.|$|E

Now that more women are joining the workforce female status attainment is becoming increasingly self-accomplished rather than through family background or gained through marriage. Still in today's society however, women are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> hold full-time jobs. This is especially true with women who come from a less privileged background or who have lower education levels.

The question: “Would you rate your health as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?” is quick and easy (and cheap) to administer, and correlates well with more objective indicators of health (such as subsequent death). But there are significant cross-national differences in response patterns. Canadians are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than Americans <b>to</b> provide extreme responses – excellent or poor.
