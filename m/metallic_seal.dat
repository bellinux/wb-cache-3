40|$|A {{container}} {{designed for}} storing samples of hazardous material features a double wall, {{part of which}} is sacrificed during an explosion-welding {{process in which the}} container is sealed and transferred to a clean environment. The major advantage of this container sealing process is that once the samples have been sealed inside, the outer wall of what remains of the container is a clean surface that has not come into contact with the environment from which the samples were taken. Thus, {{there is no need to}} devise a decontamination process capable of mitigating all hazards that might be posed by unanticipated radioactive, chemical, and/or biological contamination of the outside of the container. The container sealing method was originally intended to be used to return samples from Mars to Earth, but it could also be used to store samples of hazardous materials, without the need to decontaminate its outer surface. The process stages are shown. In its initial double-wall form, the volume between the walls is isolated from the environment; in other words, the outer wall (which is later sacrificed) initially serves to protect the inner container from contamination. The sample is placed inside the container through an opening at one end, then the container is placed into a transfer dock/lid. The surfaces that will be welded together under the explosive have been coated with a soft metallic sacrificial layer.

40|$|To move {{nanotechnology}} {{out of the}} lab {{and into}} common use requires understanding and experience of the structures and processes involved. The technological maturity allowing {{the widespread use of}} nanotechnology is practically nonexistent outside of the integrated circuit industry. This work provides a synergy of the science of nanorod growth and the technology of metallic glue in ambient. Starting from the science, this thesis presents the design and control of the structure and morphology of nanorods grown by physical vapor deposition. We demonstrate the use of deposited seeds as a method to control the diameter and spacing of surface grown nanorods. These seeds are made of low melting temperature metals that form nonwetting clusters on a substrate. Materials In, Sn, and Ga are used and demonstrated to be effective. The diameter and spacing of nanorods made of the materials Ag and Cu are controlled by use of these seeds. We also demonstrate the capping of nanorods produced by physical vapor deposition with a second step also conducted with PVD. The caps demonstrated are made of metals and metal oxides. The primary application of the metal oxide shells is longer survivability of sensing substrates in Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. Metal shells on metal nanorods offer improvements in room temperature <b>metallic</b> <b>sealing.</b> Additionally, we introduce our developing technology of <b>metallic</b> <b>sealing</b> using non-vacuum processes.

5000|$|The {{technology}} {{works like}} this: during a piping installation, the axial {{movement of the}} Lokring driver over the fitting body swages the body onto the pipe surface, compressing the pipe wall first elastically and then plastically. When the pipe wall resists this swaging action, it generates high unit compressive loads at the contact points. These contact stresses are high enough to plastically yield the pipe surface under the multiple sealing lands, forming a 360-degree circumferential, permanent, metal-to-metal seal between the pipe and fitting body. Finally, the installation process causes the Lokring driver to grow slightly in diameter — an [...] "elastic strain" [...] — so that it exerts an elastic, radial preload on the <b>metallic</b> <b>seals.</b> This secures the fitting {{for the life of}} the connection.|$|R

The opening of the can is approximately 4 3 / 8 inches (111. 13 mm). This HIC is primarily designed to contain items in the DOE SNF inventory that do not meet acceptance standards for direct disposal in a geologic repository. This includes fuel in the form of particulate dusts, sectioned pieces of fuel, core rubble, melted or degraded (non-intact) fuel elements, unclad uranium alloys, metallurgical specimens, and chemically reactive fuel components. The HIC is intended to act as a substitute cladding for the spent nuclear fuel, further isolate problematic materials, provide a long-term corrosion barrier, and add an extra internal pressure barrier for the waste package. The HIC will also delay potential fission product release and maintain geometry control for extended periods of time. For the entire disposal package to be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a HIC must effectively eliminate the disposal problems associated with problem SNF including the release of radioactive and/or reactive material and over pressurization of the HIC due to chemical reactions within the can. Two HICs were analyzed to envelop a range of can lengths between 42 and 101 inches. Using Abacus software, the HIC's were analyzed for end, side, and corner drops.

40|$|The {{compliant}} <b>metallic</b> <b>seal</b> {{combines the}} noncontact {{feature of the}} labyrinth seal, the low leakage of a mechanical seal, and the compliant nature of the brush seal. It consists of several thin metallic elements or leaves mounted within a ring which is press fit into the housing, and in form, sort of resembles a lip seal sections wiping the shaft. A second set of overlapping cover leaves are placed {{on top of the}} shaft riding leaves which reduces leakage and provides stiffness. The leaves can be straight or angle cut. The shaft riding fingers are designed with mismatched curvature to provide lift off similar to the Rayleigh lift pads in mechanical seals with leading edge clearances nearly twice those of the trailing edge as as shown by Fleming to be optimal for gas flows in convergent seal passages. Leading edge clearances range from 300 to 500 microinches. Balance pockets beneath the leaves provide fluid film feed to the 'Rayleigh lift' surface and the proper balance ratio (mechanical seal) when combined with the static pressure and film pressure. The leaves flex in the radial direction and accommodate thermomechanical behavior as well as axial motion and angular misalignment. In the static mode, there is a net closing force on the leaves. The seals were tested to 70 psi at speeds to 16, 000 rpm or surface speeds to 330 fps and temperatures from ambient to 440 F. A slow cycle through the rig critical at 10, 000 rpm induced a radial vibration response of 0. 004 to 0. 005 inch were accommodated by the seal. Preliminary performance data are encouraging demonstrating hydrodynamic liftoff and noncontacting operation at pressure and speeds typical of gas turbine engines. The leakage performance data are significantly better than commercial labyrinth and brush seals which should be expected as this design incorporates the features of the low leakage face or mechanical seal along with the flexibility of the brush configuration...|$|E
40|$|Nemo Engineering AS (Nemo) {{has built}} a series of Tees for welding into {{offshore}} pipelines for transportation of hydrocarbons. The purpose with the Tees is to allow connection of new pipelines from existing or future oil and gas fields. This is often a cost-effective solution which minimises the need for construction of new pipelines. Some of the Tees are designed with open tee branch which is isolated with a ball valve system. Another solution is to design a Tee where the branch is blinded off by a solid steel barrier plate. This is a socalled Hot Tap Tee (HTT). At the time when a new pipeline is {{to be connected to}} the HTT, the steel barrier plate is drilled open by a core drill operation. This operation is performed when the pipeline is at full flow and operational pressure. The core drill operation is complex and requires a large amount of subsea tooling equipment. In addition, the operation is time consuming and involves elements of risk in case of failing equipment. Nemo Engineering as is currently working on the Ormen Lange project where two HTTs at 850 m water depth will be opened by core drilling in 2009 for connection of pipelines from a new gas field (Ormen Lange Southern Field). During this project, equipment for blinding/sealing of the opened HTT’s has been developed. This is an Isolation Plug (IP), which is used to seal off the open HTT. The purpose with the IP is to use it in case of future disassembly of the connected pipeline and isolation ball valve without compromising the integrity and operational service condition for the HTT-pipeline. Nemo Engineering as has initiated a development project of a new HTT design where the steel barrier plate is changed out with a combination of using the IP and a steel membrane seal in the tee branch. The membrane will function as a substitution for the thick steel barrier plate and function as a <b>metallic</b> <b>seal</b> until the IP is removed. The idea is that the steel membrane will break when the IP is removed, and the core drilling operation is no longer necessary. This Thesis contains the work related to preliminary design, modelling, analysis and testing of a steel membrane prototype.

30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of <b>metallic</b> <b>seal,</b> which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|E

Finally, a local (micro-scale) model is used to link the aforementioned local stress field in each die to the bonding strength: representative volumes of the rings getting into contact, accounting in a statistically way for the relevant surface roughness (which is on the order or tens of nanometers at most), are adopted to obtain the relationship between the external pressure and the percentage of sealed area.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) measurement at {{the bearings}} of rotating machinery has become {{a useful tool for}} diagnosing incipient fault conditions. In particular, AE can be used to detect unwanted intermittent or partial rubbing between a rotating central shaft and surrounding stationary components. This is a particular problem encountered in gas turbines used for power generation. For successful fault diagnosis, it is important to adopt AE signal analysis techniques capable of distinguishing between various types of rub mechanisms. It is also useful to develop techniques for inferring information such as the severity of rubbing or the type of seal material making contact on the shaft. It is proposed that modelling the cumulative distribution function of rub-induced AE signals with respect to appropriate theoretical distributions, and quantifying the goodness of fit with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, offer a suitable signal feature for diagnosis. This paper demonstrates the successful use of the KS feature for discriminating different classes of shaft- seal rubbing.

High temperature leakage tests are realized under load control conditions using a seal consisting of a 0. 3 mm thick Fecralloy sheet lying between two elastic bearings made of Udimet 720 nickel alloy. One of the bearings presents a boss for which several geometries are used. Finite element calculations are performed to describe the mechanical state of the seal as a function of time.

After completion of the fabrication of the maser's components, the maser was assembled using these parts and other components made available by SAO, NRL, and NASA from earlier development work. In March, 1990, the vacuum system was assembled, and by May the maser assembly was completed. The magnetic shielding was poor and the shields were removed, reannealed by a local vendor, and the maser was reassembled. The maser began tests in early June and has been oscillating since that time. The test results of the maser are very good and a life test of the maser is being conducted. It is anticipated that the development and construction of a maser to be tested in space under a new contract from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center will continue...|$|R
50|$|Iron {{can not be}} {{directly}} sealed to lead glass, as it reacts with the lead oxide and reduces it to <b>metallic</b> lead. For <b>sealing</b> to lead glasses, {{it has to be}} copper-plated or an intermediate lead-free glass has to be used. Iron is prone to creating gas bubbles in glass due to the residual carbon impurities; these can be removed by heating in wet hydrogen. Plating with copper, nickel or chromium is also advised.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{radioactive}} items (total curie inventory {{in excess}} of 8. 3 million curies) fabricated in the mid- 1980 s became a challenge for management in the 1990 s. Under terms of {{an agreement with the}} Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), the United States Department of Energy (DOE) had thirty radioactive isotopic sealed heat sources fabricated at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The sealed sources were to be used by the German Geologic Repository Program to simulate spent nuclear fuel in performance assessment testing at their repository site near Asse, Germany. After fabrication was completed in 1986, the sources were stored in a hot cell designed for process development and demonstration at the fabrication facility at Hanford. By 1995, the German government determined {{that they would not be}} able to take delivery of the sources. Thus presented with the challenge of the disposition of the sources, the DOE negotiated a settlement agreement. Under terms of the DOE/FRG Agreement, the German government provided funds to cover the DOE costs as well four casks designed to hold the sources during their planned transport to Germany and five casks designed to hold the sources during interim storage prior to their emplacement in the repository at Asse. The challenge was to modify the casks to utilize <b>metallic</b> <b>seals</b> that would meet a storage requirement to maintain a seal for 40 years for a cask loaded with the radioactive sources. The modified cask also had to meet the requirements for on-site transport to the new storage site and, ultimately, from the storage site. Results of the safety analyses for both cask designs, cask transport to the new storage facility, and placement on the storage pad will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design {{summary of the}} containment vessel closure for the Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP). This new package is a replacement for a package {{that has been used}} to ship tritium in a variety of content configurations and forms since the early 1970 s. The new design is based on changes in the regulatory requirements. The BTSP design incorporates many improvements over its predecessor by implementing improved testing, handling, and maintenance capabilities, while improving manufacturability and incorporating new engineered materials that enhance the package's ability to withstand dynamic loading and thermal effects. This paper will specifically summarize the design philosophy and engineered features of the BTSP containment vessel closure. The closure design incorporates a concave closure lid, <b>metallic</b> C-Ring <b>seals</b> for containing tritium gas, a metal bellows valve and an elastomer O-Ring for leak testing. The efficient design minimizes the overall vessel height and protects the valve housing from damage during postulated drop and crush scenarios. Design features will be discussed...|$|R
