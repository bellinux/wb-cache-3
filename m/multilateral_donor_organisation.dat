40|$|The rural non-farm economy (RNFE) is of {{interest}} to governments, <b>multilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>organisations,</b> non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and development practitioners because of its increasing prevalence in both developing and transition economies. In {{many parts of the}} world, the number of poor people in rural areas exceeds the capacity of agriculture to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities. Even with a decline in fertility rates and a slowing of population growth, this situation will not change significantly. Out-migration is not possible for all types of people, and urban centres cannot (or should not, for economic and social reasons) be assumed capable of providing adequate livelihood opportunities for all those unable to make a living in agriculture. For these reasons, a healthy RNFE holds out the prospect of improved livelihoods for people living in rural areas. This set of circumstances puts the spotlight on the RNFE as a potential vehicle for poverty reduction in rural areas. This paper reviews contemporary empirical and conceptual thinking on the economics of diversity, non- agricultural growth and the rural non-farm economy.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} the motives of the European Union (EU) as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>donor</b> and whether its aid allocations are {{in accordance with the}} stated goals and objectives. The research question is: Which motives determine the aid allocations of the European Commission, and are the allocations in accordance with its stated goals? The research question's relevance {{lies in the fact that}} the EC is the world's largest <b>multilateral</b> <b>donor.</b> Also, the international donor community is setting new and ambitious goals to work together for poverty eradication, such as with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Furthermore, the EU is different from other <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> as it is based on a regional constituency. It thus becomes necessary to evaluate whether the goals of the donor or its own strategic interests determine the direction of aid flows. The theory states a three-fold of donor motives: recipient needs, strategic interests and recipient merits. Moreover, theoretical postulations indicate that <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> are more likely to follow their goals than bilateral donors, as they are supposed to be independent of member states' interests. Nevertheless, the theory also states that <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> are likely to be influenced by major shareholders or the aggregate of member states' interests. To answer the research question, the thesis conducts a qualitative case study of the European Union as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>donor.</b> The analysis is based on data on aid flows from the OECD, reports, treaties, agreements and existing literature. The thesis finds that the development policy of the EU has changed from focusing on strategically important former colonies to focusing on poverty eradication and embracing all of the world's poorest countries. However, the actual disbursements from the EC have moved in the other direction; while the strategic areas were in focus, the poorest countries benefited the most, whereas when poverty eradication became the main goal, the strategic neighbours of the EU were the main recipients. The thesis shows that the EU has a long way to go before it fulfils its objectives. The EU seems to be more preoccupied with rhetoric than action in the field of development policy, at least towards the poorest countries of the world...|$|R
40|$|Global {{governance}} {{refers to}} several pillars; one important pillar is the multilateral aid architecture. Its reform can be discussed under {{the perspectives of}} representativeness, inclusiveness, and efficiency (of aid delivery). A prerequisite for efficient aid delivery is to map the rising complexity of multilateral development finance, to help identify areas for consolidation, address fragmentation and poor co-ordination at country level, and help identify comparative advantages for an institutional role assignment among multilateral agencies. After doing just that, the paper explores why the <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> have proliferated and provides broad recommendations for a more efficient and accountable <b>multilateral</b> <b>donor</b> system.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the distribution}} of aid to the social sectors between 2009 and 2011 using aid concentration curves. Its key findings are four-fold. First, despite the stated objectives of donors, total aid disbursements are broadly neutral, favouring neither the most deprived nor relatively well-off countries. Second, the pattern of social sector aid disbursements follows total aid. Third, the aid allocation patterns of bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> differ, with <b>multilaterals</b> <b>donors</b> generally being more focused on the poorest countries.

In contrast to a recent paper by Dollar and Levin, our estimates do not suggest that multilateral aid is more poverty- and policy-oriented than bilateral aid. Post-conflict resolution emerges as a significant determinant of aid allocation in 2002.

40|$|The {{effect on}} aid {{allocation}} {{of the income}} level and population size in the recipient country is analyzed. The data show that both variables have a significant and robust negative effect, but they explain {{only a small part}} of the variation. The main thrust of the paper is a meta-analysis of the large aid allocation literature, where the impact of the two variables is analyzed, controlled for a wide range of factors. By the standard meta-tests, the results converge to much the same as found in our own analysis of the data. The poverty effect is in accordance with stated policies of all donors, while the population effect appears contrary to the stated policy of all <b>donors.</b> The main <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors</b> do not influence this pattern. Indeed, the evidence suggests that the poverty effect is smaller for the <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors.</b> Six main hypotheses are presented to explain the population effect.

40|$|In this paper, we {{perform a}} Tobit {{analysis}} of aid allocations, covering the period 1999 - 2002 and accounting for both altruistic and selfish donor motives. We first compare the allocative behavior of all bilateral donors taken together {{with that of}} multilateral aid agencies, and then look at nine major bilateral donors individually. It turns out that poorer countries get clearly more aid from both bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> {{with the possible exception}} of France and Japan. Most bilateral <b>donors</b> and the <b>multilateral</b> agencies are also found to direct significantly more aid to well governed recipients if governance is measured by the World Bank?s CPIA. If the CPIA is replaced by the Kaufmann index, however, the policy orientation of aid becomes extremely weak. In contrast to a recent paper by Dollar and Levin (2004), our estimates do neither suggest that multilateral aid is more poverty and policy oriented than bilateral aid, nor that IDA performs particularly well within the group of <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors.</b> Post-conflict resolution, the third altruistic motive considered in the paper, emerges as a significant determinant of aid allocations in 2002. The importance of selfish aid motives clearly differs between bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>donors.</b> We find no evidence that donor countries were able to push through their individual trade and political interests at the multilateral level. By contrast, the export-related self interest of DAC countries provided a fairly strong incentive to grant bilateral aid, as did colonial ties.
