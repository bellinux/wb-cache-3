She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp, titled [...] "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now".

[...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable.

[...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever.

I suppose the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E

Enrolments in the school increased from 144 in 1998 to 265 in 2002 as parents became more satisfied with the educational standards at the school (p13 and p15). In reflecting on the positive changes in the school, Sarra said, [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did was believe in the people already at Cherbourg, as well as the new teaching team that was established, and be prepared to value and act upon what they had to say."

Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E

He shall hear from me again--he needn't be afraid! It contained a good many of the opinions I have expressed to you, and a good many more besides. I really believe it will attract some attention.

This will seem pitiful to you, no doubt, who publish yourself, have been before the world these several years, and are flushed with every kind of triumph; but to me it's simply a tremendous affair. It makes me believe I may do something; it has changed the whole way I look at my future. I have been building castles in the air, and I have put you in the biggest and fairest of them.

Sometimes we all play hide and seek in the yard (applied for younger students) and sometimes we discuss the problems students have with each other and I always share my own experiences.

They cover authoring computer-based animations and using the server-based software Blackboard to teach chemistry in a predominately undergraduate environment. This first part of this article deals with my continuing evolution of the use of on-line support for freshman chemistry courses at Sam Houston State University a predominantly undergraduate institution. We have an ACS-certified BS in chemistry and an MS degree in chemistry. The second part that you will find here will cover my recent experimentation with Shockwave flash animations specifically programmed to require student interactions with the animations. I use these in teaching chemistry at the senior level in an instrumental analysis course. Links to examples are provided. as teachers we're evolving In the past ten years I have evolved from a user of FTP-based server delivery of important laboratory data documents to a web-based supply of lecture syllabuses, Flash-based animations, lecture course documents, and practice quizzes. The continuing evolution of Course Management Software (CMS) like Blackboard, WebCT, etc. has substantially changed what we can choose to do in the chemistry classroom. (A very recent rumor is that Blackboard and WebCT have merged.) The key word here is choose because many of my colleagues have either not looked at what's possible or have only used it only minimally, or not at all. These are, in the main, dedicated teachers who, like all good teachers are kings and queens of efficiencies. They evaluate, continuously, things that will help them meet their idea of what they need to teach and in how they need to teach it. I do that; they do that; teachers in 1954 were doing that. The question is how modern, server-based software can increase our efficiencies.
