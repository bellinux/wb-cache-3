40|$|The {{deformation}} of aeronautical <b>monolithic</b> <b>components</b> due to CNC machining is a bottle-neck {{issue in the}} aviation industry. The residual stress releases and redistributes {{in the process of}} material removal, and the distortion of the monolithic component is generated. The traditional one-side machining method will produce oversize deformation. Based on the three-stage CNC machining method, the quasi-symmetric machining method is developed in this study to reduce deformation by symmetry material removal using the M-symmetry distribution law of residual stress. The mechanism of milling deformation due to residual stress is investigated. A deformation experiment was conducted using traditional one-side machining method and quasi-symmetric machining method to compare with finite element method (FEM). The deformation parameters are validated by comparative results. Most of the errors are within 10 %. The reason for these errors is determined to improve the reliability of the method. Moreover, the maximum deformation value of using quasi-symmetric machining method is within 20 % of that of using the traditional one-side machining method. This result shows the quasi-symmetric machining method is effective in reducing deformation caused by residual stress.

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMA) offer several {{advantages}} over traditional electro-mechanical devices, including: smooth, silent, clean operation; linear actuation; high power/weight ratio; scalability; and reduced part counts. These unique characteristics make them an attractive option when developing actuators, {{particularly at the}} meso- and micro-scales. However, SMAs do not typically display cyclic actuation and, therefore, require some reset force or bias mechanism {{in order to achieve}} this behaviour. Additionally, the micro-assembly of SMA material with a reset mechanism becomes increasingly difficult as the dimensions of actuators are scaled down. Therefore, actuators have been developed in which the actuation and reset mechanism are fabricated from a single piece of material. These actuators are referred to as monolithic actuators. Monolithic actuators are fabricated from a single piece of SMA material in which local annealing is used to selectively impart the shape memory effect (SME), while the remainder of the material acts as the bias mechanism. This work proposes an extension to monolithic actuators that locally varies the material composition of the <b>monolithic</b> <b>component</b> to exhibit different mechanical properties in select regions. This eliminates the need for local annealing by introducing regions of material unaffected by the annealing process. Additionally, incorporating regions of superelastic material to act as the bias mechanism greatly increases the actuator’s range of motion. These actuators are referred to as hybrid monolithic actuators. The creation of hybrid monolithic SMA actuators requires the development of both a fabrication technique and design tool. Varying the composition locally is accomplished by utilizing powder metallurgy fabrication techniques, specifically tape casting. Tapes of different compositions are cut, stacked, and sintered resulting in a <b>monolithic</b> <b>component</b> with mechanical properties that vary spatially. Tape casting NiTi from elemental powders is studied in this work, and tape recipes and sintering profiles are developed. In order to model the SMA behaviour of complex geometries, a finite element implementation of an existing lumped-element SMA model is developed.

Microchannel heat exchangers (MCHXs) have demonstrated 3 to 5 times higher heat fluxes {{when compared to}} conventional heat exchangers resulting in proportionate reductions in size and weight. The most common fabrication approach for producing MPT components is microchannel lamination, or microlamination, in which thin layers of metal or polymer are patterned with microchannel features, registered, and bonded to produce <b>monolithic</b> <b>components.</b> Currently, the most common microlamination architecture involves the photochemical machining and diffusion bonding of metal foils. Prior work has established that the yields in diffusion bonding often drive the costs of MCHXs. Laser keyhole welding has been proposed as an alternative bonding technology providing the potential for faster cycle times, smaller weld widths and layer-to-layer evaluation of hermeticity leading to higher yields. Furthermore, laser weldments have small heat-affected zones providing excellent mechanical strength.

40|$|AbstractMachined <b>monolithic</b> <b>components</b> {{provide the}} {{foundation}} for modern aircraft structures requiring high performance designs in terms of weight, strength, and fatigue properties. Part distortions arising from machining-induced stresses and tool deflection resulting from high dynamic cutting forces frustrate manufacturing and assembly processes, necessitating expensive in-process and post-machining corrective measures aimed at eliminating their effects. Component weight and cost requirements are often compromised by adding thicker component section designs or off-machine part flipping processes as a distortion control mechanism. Similarly, small depths of cut are taken to minimize cutting forces and tool deflection. Additional spring passes are also taken to eliminate any undercut errors introduced by unanticipated deflection and distortion problems. The ability to accurately predict and minimize tool deflections and part distortion via simulations can significantly reduce manufacturing and assembly costs. This paper presents physics-based models for predicting tool deflection and part distortions by considering the appropriate physics for each problem. Dynamic cutting forces predicted by physics-based machining models, and tool compliance properties are incorporated into a detailed linear elastic deflection model in order to predict in-process deflections along a computer numerical control (CNC) machining toolpath. Similarly, bulk stress state and machining-induced stresses for large, monolithic part machining {{are taken into account}} for predicting part distortions. Sources of stresses may include heat treatment, quenching, forging, and machining operations. Bulk stress data from heat treatment predictive models can also be imported and mapped onto the workpiece finite element model.

Results of a validation study for workpiece distortion predictions are presented for a number of monolithic, thin-walled components.

40|$|This report {{describes}} technical {{opportunities to}} serve as parts of a technological roadmap for Shoals Technologies Group in power electronics for PV applications. There are many different power converter circuits {{that can be used}} for solar inverter applications. The present applications do not take advantage of the potential for using common modules. We envision that the development of a power electronics module could enable higher reliability by being durable and flexible. Modules would have fault current limiting features and detection circuits such that they can limit the current through the module from external faults and can identify and isolate internal faults such that the remaining modules can continue to operate with only minimal disturbance to the utility or customer. Development of a reliable, efficient, low-cost, power electronics module will be a key enabling technology for harnessing more power from solar panels and enable plug and play operation. Power electronics for computer power supplies, communication equipment, and transportation have all targeted reliability and modularity as key requirements and have begun concerted efforts to replace <b>monolithic</b> <b>components</b> with collections of common smart modules. This is happening on several levels including (1) device level with intelligent control, (2) functional module level, and (3) system module. This same effort is needed in power electronics for solar applications. Development of modular units will result in standard power electronic converters that will have a lower installed and operating cost for the overall system. These units will lead to increased adaptability and flexibility of solar inverters. Incorporating autonomous fault current limiting and reconfiguration capabilities into the modules and having redundant modules will lead to a durable converter that can withstand the rigors of solar power generation for more than 30 years. Our vision for the technology roadmap is that there is no need for detailed design of new power converters for each new application or installation. One set of modules and controllers can be pre-developed and the only design question would be how many modules need to be in series or parallel for the specific power requirement. Then, a designer can put the modules together and add the intelligent reconfigurable controller. The controller determines how many modules are connected, but it might also ask for user input for the specific application during setup. The modules include protection against faults and can reset it, if necessary. In case of a power device failure, the controller reconfigures itself to continue limited operation until repair which might be as simple as taking the faulty module out and inserting a new module. The result is cost savings in design, maintenance, repair, and a grid that is more reliable and available. This concept would be a perfect fit for the recently announced funding opportunity announcement (DE-FOA- 0000653) on Plug and Play Photovoltaics...|$|E

Behavior {{is represented by}} labeled transition systems communicating through ports. Interactions are sets of ports. A synchronization between components is possible through the interactions specified {{by a set of}} connectors. When several interactions are possible, Priorities allow to restrict the non-determinism by choosing an interaction, maximal according to some given strict partial order. In this paper we present a method that transforms the architecture of {{a component}}-based program in BIP and generates a functionally equivalent program. The method is based on the successive application of three types of source-to-source transformations: flattening of components, flattening of connectors and composition of atomic components. We show that the system of the transformations is confluent and terminates. By exhaustive application of the transformations, any BIP component can be transformed into an equivalent <b>monolithic</b> <b>component.</b> From this component, efficient C code can be generated. The method combines advantages of component-based description such as clarity, incremental construction and reasoning with the possibility to generate efficient monolithic code. It has been integrated in the design methodology for BIP and it has been successfully applied to two non trivial examples described in the paper.
