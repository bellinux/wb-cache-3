5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other <b>monetary</b> <b>income</b> of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.|$|E

25|$|The consumer's preferences, <b>monetary</b> <b>income</b> {{and prices}} play an {{important}} role in solving the consumer's optimization problem (choosing how much of various goods to consume so as to maximize their utility subject to a budget constraint). The comparative statics of consumer behavior investigates the effects of changes in the exogenous or independent variables (especially prices and money incomes of the consumers) on the chosen values of the endogenous or dependent variables (the consumer's demands for the goods). When the income of the consumer rises with the prices held constant, the optimal bundle chosen by the consumer changes as the feasible set available to him changes. The income–consumption curve is the set of tangency points of indifference curves with the various budget constraint lines, with prices held constant, as income increases shifting the budget constraint out.|$|E

[...] Most of the indigenous residents of Ratanakiri are subsistence farmers, practicing slash and burn shifting cultivation. (See Culture below {{for more information on}} traditional subsistence practices.) Many families are beginning to shift production to cash crops such as cashews, mangoes, and tobacco, a trend that has accelerated in recent years. Ratanakiri villagers have traditionally had little contact with the cash economy. Barter exchange remains widespread, and Khmer Loeu villagers tended to visit markets only once per year until quite recently.

30|$|Findings of {{this study}} {{have shown that the}} bone and tallow value chains face many {{constraints}} that affect their performance and limit participation of the poor in markets (Ravallion 2007). As outlined by Poulton et al. (2006), some of these constraints include low <b>monetary</b> <b>incomes</b> for most market actors, a poorly developed monetary economy with a narrow base and input and output markets which are relatively ‘thin’ and prone to large seasonal variability in demand and supply. Strengthening of these value chains therefore require deliberate and targeted interventions in order to overcome these constraints that force the poor to perpetually operate in low equilibrium traps.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} to {{what extent}} gender gaps in education, health, employment, productive assets and inputs can affect pro poor growth (in the sense of increasing <b>monetary</b> <b>incomes</b> of the poor). After discussing serious methodological problems with examining gender issues {{in the context of}} an income-based pro-poor growth framework, the paper considers theory and evidence on the impact of gender inequality on pro poor growth. While there is a considerable literature suggesting negative impacts of gender gaps on growth, there is much less information on the impact of gender gaps on inequality. The paper then examines the experiences of country cases and finds that gender inequality can have a significant effect on pro-poor growth, but that the importance and type of effects differ considerably between different regions. It also appears that the effects of gender gaps on pro-poor growth operat...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses age-period-cohort {{models to}} show that the living {{standards}} (total <b>monetary</b> <b>incomes</b> after public benefits and contributions, adjusted for household size and inflation) of successive birth cohorts in the United States and Germany are strongly correlated with general changes in disposable incomes. This means that, after introducing controls, virtually every successive birth cohort in Germany and the United States had increasing disposable incomes, similar to general rates of economic growth. For France, however, we find that, while disposable income increased through the 20 th century, cohorts born before 1950 profited from this, while cohorts born after 1950 experience no improvement in living standards over previous cohorts, after adjusting disposable incomes for inflation and controls - mainly education and household composition. Thus, while economic growth benefits all birth cohorts in the United States and Germany, pre- 1950 birth cohorts in France have monopolized lucrative positions and social transfers so that post- 1950 birth cohorts do not benefit from economic growth...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a larger project that {{questions}} the common notion of similarity in the Polish and Russian stabilization programs, which clearly brought about different results. It investigates an array of nominal systems for the Polish economy, of domestic price level, import prices, exchange rates, money stock, nominal wages, and real output, and conducts I(1) and I(2) cointegration analyses. Post-stabilization monthly data are used, 1991 : 5 - 1999 : 12. A test for the presence of a price-wage spiral is performed, and the stabilization package is compared to its realization. The long-run homogeneity hypothesis, the impact of <b>monetary</b> and <b>incomes</b> policies, and of external sector variables on long and medium run price development are studied. It is found that in Poland, contrary to some earlier studies, the external sector is not important for the long run price development. On the contrary, very strong evidence is found of the cost-push inflation. These results are very different from the Russian rience, where inflation has had mostly monetary roots. The paper concludes with a comparative policy analysis. cointegration, <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>incomes</b> policy...|$|R
