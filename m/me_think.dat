Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone."

[...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition.

500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore.

Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B on an A+ to F scale, writing that the [...] "episode didn’t really take {{advantage}} of Jack Burton's return to the show.

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that made <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.'

500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E
