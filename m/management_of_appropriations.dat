40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework of}} the control of inter-organizational relationships. Building on transaction cost economics and organizational theory, two control problems are identified that arise when firms engage in inter-organizational relationships: the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> concerns and the coordination of tasks. The control mechanisms used to manage these control problems and their interrelationships with informal (trust-based) mechanisms are discussed. The explanatory power of the framework is assessed by {{a case study of}} a strategic alliance between a buyer and a supplier of railway safety equipment. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Our framework considers four main dimensions of the governance of cooperative firms: (1) the development and application of self-defined rules {{by the members of}} the cooperative; (2) the <b>management,</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> common resources and outcomes; (3) intrinsic motivations and reciprocating behaviours; (4) the implementation of suitable incentive mixes based on inclusion and reciprocity, including both pecuniary and non- pecuniary elements. An example is offered in order to highlight possible problems in the governance of cooperative firms, in particular the processes <b>of</b> distribution and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> surplus.

40|$|The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> {{global commons}} is of vital {{importance}} for modern society. The current solutions attempt to internalize the cost <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by adding {{this to the}} cost of private resources. In this paper we will show that this approach has some fundamental weaknesses. To overcome these shortcomings, we have proposed to segregate the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> private and shared resources by using non-scalar numbers for the underlying economic signals of money and price. We prove that the resulting non-scalar economy always reaches a macro-economic equilibrium point where the level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by the society remains steady. The second contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that the proposed design of the non-scalar economy would guarantee the accuracy of price signal with respect to the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons. In other words, rational economic agents would ensure that the price neither underestimates nor overestimates the actual level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> incurred. This will provide a powerful basis for an effective market system for the commons...|$|R
40|$|New Mexico is {{experiencing}} great changes in land use, {{population growth and}} cropping patterns. These changes, combined with extended drought, provide challenges to the <b>management</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the state’s limited water supplies. Currently, more than 75 percent of New Mexico’s water is used in agriculture. Furthermore, exotic riparian vegetation such as saltcedar results in signifi cant water consumption throughout the state. Evapotranspiration (ET), or water use by crops and riparian vegetation, is a true depletion or loss from a hydrologic system. Estimates of ET values are used in irrigation water management, water rights allocation, hydrologic modeling, as well as overall water resource planning and management.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{how certain}} ideas underlying the tort <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> may enable use more effectively {{to deal with}} the problems presented by a case such Moore v.

First, the author explores how the tort <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> identity opens up new approaches to inform and perhaps supplement principles of property law as a guide to managing genetic information or other materials that seem intimately bound up with a particular human subject. Secondly, the author analyzes how the various opinions produced by the Supreme Court implicitly elaborate a powerful and problematic relation between the spheres of private life, science and the market, such that the science is granted special status and power relative to the other two – or rather, how the Supreme Court effectively exploits the social status of science to expand the reach of the market into the private sphere of control over the body. Finally, the author considers how the Appellate Court’s discussion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> identity suggests possible new avenues to pursue regarding the legal recognition and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> both individual and group identity...|$|R
40|$|The poster {{we would}} like to discuss at the meeting in Berne {{presents}} a theoretical and methodical approach to apply the concept of “sustainable space appropriation” (Nachhaltige Raumaneignung) in an empirical research project. The poster refers to the research project Sustainable design, <b>management</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> urban public parks within the NFP 54. We expect our research results to provide public authorities, administrators and planners with decision-making knowledge on the potential as well as the limits of landscape design and park management for a sustainable urban policy. Some preliminary results of the project will also be included in the poster. Parks contain a great potential to raise {{the quality of life of}} urban citizens and foster social sustainability as they offer opportunities for equal <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> these sites. However, even though the use of the concepts sustainability and appropriation has been proliferating recently, these concepts still are highly contested and severely under-theorized.

40|$|This article reintroduces {{the concept}} of 'appropriation of space' into current {{theoretical}} debates and empirical approaches in environmental psychology. We present an analysis of a case study conducted in a Barcelona metropolitan river corridor, aimed at exploring how the development of people-place bonds can foster pro-environmental behaviours in a natural open space. The multi-method qualitative analysis based on participant observation, documentary research and interviews with 57 inhabitants reveals a long-term process <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the riverside environment that typically results {{in a sense of}} responsibility of the subject towards it.

40|$|Since 1995, an {{experiment}} of co-management is {{carried in the}} lagoon Aby (Côte d'Ivoire) for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the fishery. The process {{is based on a}} consensual defintion of the rules <b>of</b> <b>management</b> and the setting up of organisational structures (fisching committees) ready to work with the gouvernemental agencies to achieve the common goals <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> The preliminary results show that the fishermen are conscious of their duties. They are available to involve themselves in an active and efficient cooperation. The structure of exchange (communication) created on this purpose permits to ensure a satisfying participation of all. The bio-economic impacts of the co-management can already be perceived. Though these positive results are benefic to the whole fishery, there happens that some fishermen (the owners of beach seines) pay heavy taxes, and that leads to their opposition to the innovation. The process of co-management has favoured the supervision of the resources rather than their management in an extensive way. Consequently, women are not consulted in the decision making whereas they undergo the effects <b>of</b> that <b>management.</b> The <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the process by the users which goes on slowly, to be perpetuated, must formalize the intitutional instruments (laws, status of committees etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons.
