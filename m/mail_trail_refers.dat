50|$|Boozman {{has worked}} to honor and {{preserve}} the historical record of the role Arkansas played in the westward expansion {{and development of the}} United States. Boozman introduced legislation in the 110th Congress calling for a study of the historic Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>Trail</b> for the potential addition to the National Trails System. This legislation passed as part of an omnibus bill (P.L. 111-11), and was signed by President Obama on March 30, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The Hudson's Bay Brigade <b>Trail,</b> {{sometimes}} <b>referred</b> {{to simply}} as the Brigade <b>Trail,</b> <b>refers</b> {{to one of two}} routes used by Hudson's Bay Company fur traders to transport furs, goods and supplies between coastal and Columbia District headquarters at Fort Vancouver and those in New Caledonia and also in Rupert's Land. Importantly the route was that used by the annual [...] "Hudson's Bay Express", a shipment of the company books and profits to company headquarters.|$|R
2500|$|Old Wire Road, {{which took}} {{its name from}} the {{telegraph}} lines running beside it after 1860, passed through the area [...] east of Pea Ridge, providing a connection north to Springfield, Missouri, and south to Fayetteville (Washington County) and Fort Smith (Sebastian County). Before 1881, mail for Pea Ridge was dropped at Elkhorn Inn and Tavern, a stagecoach stop, and carried to the town by horseback, buggy, or wagon. The Butterfield Company bought the stage line in 1858, making the road part of the Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>trail</b> reaching west to California.|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald Station and Farmstead is a {{collection}} of historic buildings and structures in Springdale, Arkansas associated with the Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>Trail.</b> Historically the site of a tavern popular with travelers heading west prior to the establishment of the Butterfield Trail, the property became a station along the route in the 1850s. Today, the property retains an original 1850s barn built as a waypoint along the route, as well as a 1870s house and associated outbuildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2003.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Civil War, the {{withdrawal}} of Union Army forces left a void which several Indian tribes took advantage in order to start raids on the <b>mail</b> <b>trails</b> leading through the territory. To solve this, Young offered the government the services of the Nauvoo Legion, the Mormon militia organization. After discussing his offer with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln accepted the formation of a thirty-man cavalry company for ninety days; this was later expanded into a 106-man company. Although the company made several efforts to track down the culprits of the raids, it never saw any military action.|$|R
25|$|On the mountain, {{there was}} also a grand display of nature and hiking trails, plus a mule ride that took guests around a <b>trail</b> <b>referred</b> to as the Mount Lowe Eight.

5000|$|The Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>Trail</b> [...] was a stagecoach {{service in}} the United States, {{operating}} from 1857 to 1861. It carried passengers and U.S. Mail from two eastern termini, Memphis, Tennessee and St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California. The routes from each eastern terminus met at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and then continued through Indian Territory, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Baja California, and California ending in San Francisco. On March 3, 1857, Congress under James Buchanan authorized the U.S. postmaster general, Aaron Brown, to contract for delivery of the U.S. mail from Saint Louis to San Francisco. Prior to this, U.S. Mail bound for the Far West had been transported by ship across the Gulf of Mexico to Panama, where it was freighted across the isthmus to the Pacific, then taken by ship for points in California.|$|R
5000|$|The {{settlement}} and associated mission moved {{several times over}} the next few hundred years. In 1691 the original refugee mission was replaced by an adobe structure. A flood in 1740 washed away that mission. It was rebuilt on higher ground four years later. The Tigua (i.e. Tiwa people) of Ysleta were among the most faithful Christian converts in the area and the Spanish were keen to keep the settlement healthy and vibrant. In the period between 1829 and 1831 the river moved much further south than usual. In 1836 the new country of Texas claimed the new channel of the Rio Grande as the boundary. In 1848, with the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Ysleta was ceded to the United States. [...] The mission was a stop on the Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>trail</b> from 1858 to 1861.|$|R
5000|$|Heading {{south from}} Edmonton, the trail was called [...] "Calgary Trail". Calgary <b>Trail</b> now <b>refers</b> to the {{southbound}} portion of Highway 2 {{within the boundaries}} of the city of Edmonton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{river is}} of {{significant}} historical importance to both First Nations and Canadian history. For centuries, the Dakelh (Carrier) and Tsilhqot'in peoples used a trail—the so-called [...] "Grease Trail"—on the northern {{side of the}} river in their trade with coastal First Nations communities. The name Grease <b>Trail</b> <b>refers</b> to one of the main commodities transported along the route—eulachon grease, a highly prized staple, traces of which coated parts of the route after centuries of use. It was this trail that Sir Alexander Mackenzie used in his historic overland journey west to the Pacific Ocean in 1793, traversing the river itself on his return.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} white settler in what became Vilas County {{was a man}} named Ashman who established a trading post in Lac du Flambeau in 1818. Eagle River's name {{was derived from the}} abundance of eagles nesting along the river. It is believed that Bethuel Draper and [...] "Dutch Pete" [...] Cramer camped in the area in 1853 and were responsible for naming the community. A settlement grew as other families settled in the area in 1857. The town of Eagle River was created by an act of the state legislature in 1885. Vilas County was set off from Oneida County on April 12, 1893 and named for William Freeman Vilas, a migrant from Vermont. Vilas had served for Wisconsin in the United States Senate from 1891 to 1897. In the 1850s migrants from New England, primarily from Vermont and Connecticut, constructed a number of wagon roads and trails through Vilas County including the Ontonogan <b>Mail</b> <b>Trail</b> and a Military Road from Fort Howard to Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|Data {{theft and}} {{alteration}} {{has been a}} major problem in the recent times. Moreover, as far as patient health records are concerned, there are always potential threats of information leakages, data hacking, information destruction, manipulation or even blackmailing of patients by the external or internal users. Since the consequences of Information leaks are comparatively high in contrast to information alterations, one possible way to have information regarding the user of information is to audit information trails.Audit <b>trails</b> <b>refer</b> to keeping information about who had recently used or accessed patient records. Through the usage of audit trails and the above-mentioned security steps, Electronic Health Records could most probably be made the best way of collecting, storing, retaining and using patient health information.|$|R

5000|$|A US Forest Service sign on {{the access}} <b>trail</b> <b>refers</b> to these {{mountains}} as [...] "The Deadly Bells" [...] and warns would-be climbers of [...] "downsloping, loose, rotten and unstable" [...] rock that [...] "kills without warning". Unlike other mountains in the Rockies that are composed of granite and limestone, the Bells are composed of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that has hardened into rock over millions of years. Mudstone is weak and fractures readily, giving rise to dangerously loose rock along almost any route. The mudstone {{is responsible for the}} Bells' distinctive maroon color. The Bells got their [...] "deadly" [...] name in 1965 when eight people died in five separate accidents.Maroon Lake (9,580') occupies a basin that was sculpted by Ice-Age glaciers and later dammed by landslide and rockfall debris from the steep slopes above the valley floor.|$|R

30|$|Based on {{previous}} findings for {{other types of}} edge habitats, we predicted that plant assemblages {{on the edges of}} fire trails (defined here as the area where vegetation begins {{on the side of the}} trail up to 2 m into woodlands immediately adjacent to the trail) would differ from assemblages not exposed to the influence of fire trails. We compared plant assemblage structure (species richness, total plant density), species composition, and functional traits (leaf mass per area, plant height, and seed mass) between edge habitat adjacent to fire <b>trails</b> (hereafter <b>referred</b> to as fire-trail habitat) and habitat in the interior of woodland vegetation well away from fire <b>trails</b> (<b>referred</b> to as interior habitat) to detect fire-trail impacts. We explored the effects of fire trails both at the level of the whole plant assemblage as well as the understory and overstory levels. We compared a range of environmental attributes related to light and soil environments shared between fire-trail and interior habitats to determine whether any observed differences in plant assemblages were linked to variation in environmental conditions. The findings from this research will be useful for land managers planning new trail construction, or wherever there is a need to understand potential impacts to vegetation by existing trails. For researchers, relationships emerging between measured functional traits and environmental attributes will contribute to trait-based ecology and provide a broadly applicable model of how this type of habitat disturbance might affect plant species based on their functional traits.|$|R
