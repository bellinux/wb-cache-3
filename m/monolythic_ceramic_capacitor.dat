25|$|Power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are mostly}} {{specified}} for {{much higher than}} 200 volt-amps. The great plasticity of ceramic raw material and the high dielectric strength of ceramics deliver solutions for many applications and are {{the reasons for the}} enormous diversity of styles within the family of power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors.</b> These power capacitors have been on the market for decades. They are produced according to the requirements as class 1 power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> with high stability and low losses or class 2 power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> with high volumetric efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The rate {{of aging}} of Class 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> depends mainly on its materials. Generally, {{the higher the}} {{temperature}} dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is about 2.5% per decade. The aging rate of Z5U <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.|$|R

25|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> may {{experience}} changes to their electrical parameters due to soldering stress. The {{heat of the}} solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes. For ferroelectric class 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> the soldering temperature is above the Curie point. The polarized domains in the dielectric are going back and the aging process of class 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is starting again.|$|R
25|$|Class 1 <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{have the}} lowest {{volumetric}} efficiency among <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors.</b> This {{is the result of}} the relatively low permittivity (6 to 200) of the paraelectric materials. Therefore, class 1 capacitors have capacitance values in the lower range.|$|R
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of these power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be very}} large. At high power applications the losses of these capacitors can generate a lot of heat. For this reason some special styles of power <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> have pipes for water-cooling.|$|R

40|$|H 2 O-induced {{degradation}} in TiO 2 -based <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> (rutile-based <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor)</b> was {{studied by}} means of the electrolysis of water. In the test, the <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> were placed in a 0. 01 M NaOH solution and a small dc voltage was applied to evolve hydrogen onto their silver electrodes. The samples treated by electrolysis of water showed obvious degradation as their permittivity decreased and their dielectric loss increased significantly. I-V measurements indicated that the resistance decreased greatly in the degraded samples. The decrease in resistance could be ascribed to the generation of charge carriers due to the reduction reaction of atomic hydrogen from the electrolysis of water. These results suggested that the reduction reaction of atomic hydrogen at ambient temperature was a cause of the degradation for the rutile <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
25|$|The X2Y {{footprint}} {{results in}} lower mounted inductance. This is particularly {{of interest for}} use in high-speed digital circuits with clock rates of several 100MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitors</b> on the PCB. However, this particular type of <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.|$|R

High reliability for the <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> was obtained with optimal ceramic composition, sintering temperature, epoxy resin, curing agent and additives, which was satisfied with practical microwave technologies...|$|R
