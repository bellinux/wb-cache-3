40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> meta-cognition among university students. Two hundred and three respondents from a university in Malaysia were chosen through random sampling. Descriptive research design was used in this study. The <b>Mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> meta-cognition Inventory was used to measure <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> meta-cognition. The data was analyzed using the descriptive statistic to measure mean and standard deviation of <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> meta-cognition. The findings indicates that most of the respondents have a moderate level in <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> also in <b>mathematics</b> meta-cognition. Further analysis shows that there is a positive relationship between <b>mathematics</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy [r(203) = 0. 311; p< 0. 05] <b>and</b> also <b>mathematics</b> meta-cognition [r(203) = 0. 216; p< 0. 05]. The findings obtained from the study can guide mathematics educators on the importance of <b>mathematics</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> meta-cognition of university students. This is where serious attention should be given in mathematics education to ensure the production of good students in mathematics. Overall, the findings of the research gave useful implication in the mathematics profession, especially in the field of mathematics education...|$|R

40|$|The urge {{to excel}} or perform maximally in {{mathematics}} varies from individual to individual because achievement motivation is often developed or learnt during socialization and learning experiences. The {{study examined the}} relationship between College of Education students’ achievement motivation <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> achievement, correlation coefficient between <b>mathematics</b> anxiety <b>and</b> college students’ achievement motivation as well as <b>mathematics</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> achievement. The sample, 268 College of Education students offering mathematics as one of their subject combination, was selected using purposive sampling techniques. Three research instruments namely: Mathematics Anxiety Scale (MAS), Achievement Motivation Scale (AMS) <b>and</b> <b>Mathematics</b> Achievement Test (MAT) were used to collect data for the study. Data collected for the study were analyzed using correlational analysis and ANOVA. The results showed that a significantly low negative correlation coefficient existed between <b>mathematics</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> achievement. There is a negative and significant correlation coefficient between <b>mathematics</b> anxiety <b>and</b> achievement motivation. Similarly, a positive and significant correlation coefficient also exists between achievement motivation <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> achievement. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that mathematics teachers should adopt activity based strategies and conducive learning environment in order to reduce college students’ anxieties in mathematics learning...|$|R
