Does this EXQUISITE Tipperary scribe know the difference between Hurrygurrybang and Burrumtollah? Not he! and because, forsooth, in those strange and distant lands strange circumstances have taken place, it is insinuated that the relater is a liar: nay, that the very places themselves have no existence but in my imagination.

The influences of a university town are too purely scholarly to produce literary work of wide human interest. London had always fascinated me--though as yet I have met with many disappointments.

40|$|In this thesis, I explore <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> family <b>history</b> in {{relation}} to the difficulties and challenges raised when representing a trauma in the past. My focus was the Blaaukraantz Bridge railway disaster of 1911, where my great great grandfather, Paul Tarr, was among the 29 victims. The links between <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> family <b>history</b> and the disaster are explored in my art practice. In the mini thesis, I unpack theoretical concerns surrounding memory, loss, and representation of past trauma by examining selected works by Christian Boltanski, Rachel Whiteread and Doris Salcedo. I do not endeavour to provide new insights about early twentieth-century history but instead to engage with different ways of forming narratives about the past. Memory as an alternative form of history writing is the key concept in this thesis in that personal memory and testimony provides an integral perception of the past and important details that would not appear in history texts or other factual forms of writing the past. In this thesis I unpack this issue {{in relation}} to my own art practice...|$|R

It was nobody's fault, perhaps, that I was taught that the Christian religion depended on a certain series of nature miracles and a chain of historical events, and when I went East to school I had more of this same sort of instruction. I have never, perhaps, been overburdened with intellect, but the time arrived nevertheless when I began to think for myself. Some of the older boys went once, I remember, to the rector of the school--a dear old man--and frankly stated our troubles. To use a modern expression, he stood pat on everything.

6000|$|Such was {{the spot}} {{that was then}} known in all that region {{by the name of}} the [...] "Chainbearer's Huts." [...] This name has been {{retained}} and the huts are still standing, circumstances having rendered them memorable in <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> <b>history,</b> and caused me to direct their preservation, at least as long as I shall live. As the place had been inhabited a considerable time that spring and summer, it bore some of the other signs of the presence of man; but on the whole, its character as a residence was that of deep forest seclusion. In point of fact, it stood buried in the woods, distant fully fifteen miles from the nearest known habitation, and in so much removed from the comfort, succor, and outward communications of civilized life. These isolated abodes, however, are by no means uncommon in the State, even at the present hour; and it is probable that some of them will be found during the whole of this century. It is true, that the western, middle, southern, southwestern, northwestern and northeastern counties of New York, all of which were wild, or nearly so, at the time of which I am writing, are already well settled, or are fast filling up, but there is a high mountainous region, in middle-northern New York, which will remain virtually a wilderness, I should think, for quite a century, if not longer. I have travelled through this district of wilderness very lately, and have found it picturesque and well suited for the sportsman, abounding in deer, fish and forest birds, but not so much suited to the commoner wants of man, as to bring it very soon into demand for the ordinary purposes of the husbandman. If this quarter of the country do not {{fall into the hands of}} lawless squatters and plunderers of one sort and another, of which there is always some danger in a country of so great extent, it will become a very pleasant resort of the sportsman, who is likely soon to lose his haunts in the other quarters of the State.|$|E
40|$|This {{project began}} as a {{memorial}} to an athlete who died of cancer, and ended as a journey through grief. The focus of my research is to explore through an autoethnography of loss, how {{the death of a}} young athlete is experienced and how as an athlete, I make sense of loss outside of sport. Visiting and revisiting spaces of loss and grief in sport allowed me to explore more deeply <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> <b>histories</b> as fragmented stories of grief. Through autoethnography and meta-autoethnography, this research seeks to uncover the meanings that reside in grieving in sport, examining the language we use to talk about death and loss in a culture of grief shrouded with stories of heroics and feel-good narratives. As I continue on my grief journey, I negotiate and re-negotiate the meanings I have constructed in my experiences. I will continue to do that as I venture through life and navigate the texts, searching to find balance between writing lives and writing loss...|$|R

40|$|The aim was {{to explore}} my own {{professional}} experiences {{in the role of}} a special school teacher; a role which I had recently moved to after 16 years teaching in mainstream education. The purposes framed this study: 1. To gain an insight and in-depth understanding {{of the role of the}} special school teacher. 2. To examine the influences of teacher identity, personal morality, autonomy and power, upon the role through autobiography. Using Clandinin and Connellyâs (2000) narrative inquiry methodology, data sources included field texts, reflective journal and other salient material. Deep and ongoing reflection using the three-dimensional inquiry space and narrative thinking played a significant part of ensuring the rigour of the study. Results indicate that there is a significant impact upon the role of the teacher due to a lack of specialist training, which impacted upon power and leadership roles within the relationships across teaching teams. Teacher identity, beliefs and personal morality appeared to have an influence upon professional decisions. Generous autonomy and lack of direct accountability appeared to be a significant factor in providing opportunity for a cultural acceptance of poor standards by a small minority of staff. <b>My</b> <b>personal</b> <b>histories</b> were seen to have a significant impact upon my present values and attitudes and had a significant impact upon the shaping of my teacher identity. This narrative inquiry assists in understanding the role of the special needs teacher at a time of profound interest in SEN. It supports understanding the complexities of teacher identity during a time of significant role change and how this affects the teaching role. This study supports a deeper understanding of factors such as morality, power and autonomy and their interconnectedness with relationships in special education. ...|$|R
