40|$|In the {{transition}} from a command to a <b>market</b> economy, macroeconomic <b>stabilisation</b> is a grave issue facing the reform governments. A distinct feature of China's economic fluctuations in the post- 1979 period has been its "soft-constraint competition". A tworegion game theoretical model is developed in this paper. We find that the fiscal decentralisation resulting from the earlier stage of economic liberalisation takes the inflation and fiscal deficits out of the control of the central monetary authorities. The recent financial reform makes the provincial governments' investment drives subject to the influence of the monetary authorities. However, further financial reform, by hardening the budget constraint, implies massive borrowing from the domestic and, perhaps more likely, the international financial markets to finance government deficits. Our model shows that this will reduce inflation but generate excessive fiscal deficits and will subsequently lead to a large build-up in the stock of debt.

40|$|Generally {{speaking}} {{the policy of}} fish consumption is a very complicated matter. In the postwar period fish consumption in Poland has been determined {{by the size of}} supplies. We have had a situation where an effective demand could not be met. The structure of fish consumption — in comparison with the interwar period — has also changed considerably. This was due to the changes in frontiers, the widening of the fishing areas entry into entirely new areas and finally the changes in the consumption habits of some groups of population. In Poland it is taken for granted that fish consumption has a substitutional and not a complementary character. This seems to be confirmed by a high indice of income elasticity for fish and processed fish. There exist great discrepancies between fish consumption in different regions of the country and in the urban — rural aspect. The fish consumption fluctuated — exluding the factor of a buying power of the population — according not only to the size of supplies but also according to various economic and outer-economic solutions linked with the market sphere. Besides the organization of distribution, material and technical basis of turnover, different links of said turnover, instutional structure — a very important role played the price polices. The present price policy restraints to a large degree the substitution between meat and fish foodstuffs. Fish foodstuffs are not at present a durable substitution for meat, because of uneven supplies (from the territorial as well as seasonal apects). It should be stressed that the development of substitution between meat and fish is of great importance to the policies aiming at <b>market</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. In {{considering}} {{the challenges and}} pitfalls of South Africa's global integration, the circumstances preceding the liberalisation attempt of the 1980 's were considered. The De Kock approach to liberalising the economy was unsuccessful owing to the real side of the economy not being {{in a position to}} support the liberalisation of the dynamic financial sector. The role of sequencing appears to have been ignored. The lack of government stabilisation was a primary factor contributing to the failure of this liberalisation attempt. Foreign investors, who had been attracted by the well-developed financial sector, lost confidence when exposed to the accompanying backward real sector. Contrary to authorities' initial aim, this premature liberalisation attempt was fatally disrupted by trade and financial sanctions imposed against South Africa. This placed South Africa's ability to meet its international debt commitments in jeopardy. Foreigners refused to roll over debt, and this resulted in a debt standstill in September 1985. To save the crumbling economy, a surplus on current account of balance of payments had to be imposed as a policy measure in order to pay back foreign debt. Although this may have seemed sensible to the authorities at the time, the negative effect that such a policy of price adjustments would have on investment, and therefore growth, was ignored. On examining the correlation between investment and the current account post 1985, {{it is clear that the}} current account was in surplus as investment declined. This strongly suggests that investment was the adjustment variable which induced the current account surplus. This paper suggests that such a situation could have been avoided had more attention been given to the sequence in which the economy was opened up. A Smithian approach is proposed. Regression analysis is employed in order to develop an investment function. This model clearly shows that a depreciating exchange rate impacts negatively on investment. Thus the maintenance of a current account surplus was not in the interests of investment growth, and hence economic growth. Rather than relying on balance of payments adjustments, South Africa should possibly have allowed a greater role for organised sequencing. The first step in the Smithian series is the liberalisation of the real sector. Recent World Trade Organisation negotiations have contributed to progress in this regard. The real sector is making good progress in integrating with the world economy. However, it is possibly being hindered by the reluctance of the government to liberalise the foreign exchange <b>market.</b> <b>Stabilisation,</b> the second step in the series is being hindered by the aforementioned reluctance in terms of the foreign exchange market, and by fiscal policies which are lagging behind the progress of monetary policy. The primary problem in terms of fiscal policy is that the authorities have yet to recognise the complementarity of price as well as income adjustments. Financial markets are liberalising fast. The primary concern here is that these markets are opening up in favour of foreigners, rather than in favour of residents. Such lopsidedness may hinder the effectiveness of a liberalisation attempt. Therefore, if South Africa is to open up its economy in the well structured Smithian manner, we need to: speed up foreign exchange market liberalisation; recognise the complementary role of price and income adjustments in attaining a tighter fiscal stance; attempt to open up the financial sector in favour of residents as well as non-residents...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} effectiveness of an emission trading system {{depends on the}} one hand on the stringency of the cap {{and on the other hand}} on the scheme's ability to provide stable regulatory conditions and incentives for investment in emission saving technologies. However, in case of highly volatile CO 2 prices no clear investment signal is provided and hence firms' decision making and planning is rendered difficult. Analyses of price developments in the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) indicate that in Phase 1 (2005 - 2007) fluctuations were mainly caused by incomplete information at the beginning, adjustments after the emergence of verified emission data and regulatory mechanisms. At the beginning of Phase 2 (2008 - 2012) in contrast a decline in carbon prices was observed as firms sold surplus allowances resulting from lower emissions due to economic recession. For Phase 3 of the EU ETS (2013 - 2020) hence the introduction of price stabilisation measures has been suggested by several member countries during the discussions on the EU energy and climate package. Various instruments can be integrated in a cap-and-trade scheme in order to reduce price volatility such as provisions for banking and borrowing, the approval of offsets for compliance purposes and hybrid systems, i. e., combinations of price and quantity mechanisms. Given the long-term nature of climate policy, the related uncertainties regarding technological change and political frameworks, and given a rising speculation in carbon <b>markets,</b> such price <b>stabilisation</b> approaches should be considered for the future design of emission trading schemes. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} to suggest an {{alternative}} framework for the analysis of commodity stabilisation schemes, based on more secure micro-economic foundations. We begin with what might be termed the general theory of partial (or incomplete) price stabilisation. This meets objection (vi) above, and shows how the shape of the demand schedule and the source and specification of risk influence the size and distribution of welfare gains. It therefore allows the reader to appreciate the importance of the more detailed model specification which is required to investigate the remaining questions. This new model allows one to distinguish between the short run and long run impact of stabilisation, and to examine the importance of risk aversion and individual supply elasticity on the distribution of gains and losses from partial stabilisation. In particular, we do not discuss the dynamics of price stabilisation in the paper (price expectations, learning, the stochastic nature of buffer stocks, etc.), nor do we model demand uncertainty, the macro-economic impact of risk and <b>stabilisation,</b> <b>market</b> imperfections, interactions with future markets, private speculators, with other commodities, {{and a host of other}} important issues. For these, and for a more detailed exposition of some of the key concepts presented here, the interested reader is referred to our forthcoming book (Newbery and Stiglitz, 1980). Finally, we should point out that the buffer stock rules analysed here are not optimal rules, which can only be derived from complete dynamic analysis, as derived and discussed in the book 1 Turnovsky (1978 a) examines a simple parameterisation of a partial stabilisation scheme, but restricts the analysis to the linear Waugh-Oi-Massell case...|$|R

Two research questions were addressed, namely: to what extent could OPEC have stabilised global oil prices within a particular target price band; and to what extent were OPEC’s stabilisation policies rendered ineffective by market forces? Consistent with the positivist’s research paradigm, unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) models were applied to monthly data over the 13 year period 2000 - 2012 on a range of relevant variables identified from the literature. Granger causality tests, impulse response functions (IRFs) and forecast error variance decompositions (FEVDs) were obtained from the VAR estimates to enable a critical analysis to be undertaken of the complex dynamics at play between OPEC and other key market players. The major contributions of the study are: it establishes that OPEC failed over the period 2000 - 2012 to operate as an effective cartel for controlling oil prices; it provides an innovative contribution to research methodology by utilising VAR impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions to describe the complex interactions between various players with diverse objectives in the markets; it {{contributes to the}} OPEC cartel literature in a novel way; it should enable regulators to better understand the political, social and economic interaction between key players in the oil markets, thereby increasing chances of policy embracement by all parties; it also makes a theoretical contribution by employing a framework based on target (price) zone theory; and finally it establishes that oil price band policy has the potential to be an important element of price stability in the oil market.

40|$|In the {{marginal}} arid and semi-arid agro-ecosystems of Africa, livelihoods largely depend on crop and animal husbandry, and non-farm employment. For years, farming {{in such areas}} has been compounded by recurrent rain failure, acute soil erosion, high pest incidences, overgrazing and poor cultivation methods leading to a serious environmental hazard. In {{the last decade or}} so, the scene has witnessed the entry of new forces: structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), with their corresponding currency devaluations and subsequent rising input costs, liberalisation, privatisation, globalisation and general institutional decline due to mismanagement or as part of the conditionalities accompanying the World Bank's/IMF's structural reform package. The consequent withdrawal of the state from its traditional roles of agricultural <b>marketing,</b> and especially <b>stabilisation</b> of producer prices and sourcing for external markets, protectionism and provision of services such as basic inputs (certified or improved seeds and technology through research and extension) appear to be putting the African farmer in a rather precarious position. Further, the lack of industries to absorb surplus rural labour, the growing poverty and a rising demand for food and incomes imply that a greater proportion of the rural population in Kenya and other parts of Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) is likely to combine agriculture with non-agricultural activities especially petty trade, as they continuously undergo a process of deagrarianisation. On the other hand, market reforms accompanying SAPs appear to have brought with them profit opportunities, which some (though few) farmers have seized upon to increase or stabilise incomes for their households. In Mbeere, this seems to be taking place in the introduction of various forms of production and marketing innovations among smallholder farmers in the areas of fruit and dairy iii production. Such farmers appear to be embracing what appears like entrepreneurial or profit-oriented farming, though without completely abandoning ordinary or traditional farming. This form of livelihood diversification in turn, seems to be having positive implications for income redistribution, employment creation and poverty reduction. These production and marketing innovations need to be studied with a view not only to understanding them better but also to informing future policy that targets the rural poor. This research proposal is divided into six sections. Section 1. 0 gives the introductory overview or background of the study and attempts to define the direction of its thrust with regard to other recent development research findings and policy.
