The ADC found that WCRC's Safety <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety <b>Management</b> <b>System.</b> WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety <b>Management</b> <b>System.</b> The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
