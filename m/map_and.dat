5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field <b>map</b> <b>and</b> battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field <b>map</b> <b>and</b> track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E

5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team {{drew up a}} <b>map</b> <b>and</b> {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below).

G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> a drag and drop inventory.|$|E

5|$|As {{is often}} the case with huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, <b>map</b> <b>and</b> record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Blue Wing Blitz is a {{traditional}} turn-based tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly aerial warfare units.

A spokesperson confirmed the download was for media review purposes, {{and that there were}} no plans to distribute the game to the public through Games on Demand. Four days later, hackers managed to access, download, and distribute the game online; Microsoft stated they were investigating the matter. Halo 2, Halo 3, and ODST were similarly leaked ahead of their planned release.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a <b>map</b> <b>and</b> entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated.

In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} new bijections on planar maps. At first a bijection is established between bipolar orientations on planar <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> specific “transversal structures” on triangulations of the 4 -gon with no separating 3 -cycle, which are called irreducible triangulations. This bijection specializes to a bijection between rooted non-separable <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> rooted irreducible triangulations. This yields in turn a bijection between rooted loopless <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> rooted triangulations, {{based on the}} observation that loopless <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> triangulations are decomposed {{in a similar way}} into components that are respectively non-separable <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> irreducible triangulations. This gives another bijective proof (after Wormald’s construction published in 1980) of the fact that rooted loopless maps with n edges are equinumerous to rooted triangulations with n inner vertices...|$|R
