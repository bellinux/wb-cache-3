25|$|In Brazil young Sigmund {{adopted the}} name Pedro and worked odd {{jobs as a}} dock worker, a road <b>mender,</b> a {{plantation}} labourer and, in 1895, a cook for a British intelligence expedition. Rosenblum allegedly saved both the expedition {{and the life of}} Major Charles Fothergill when hostile natives attacked them. Rosenblum seized a British officer's pistol and, with single-hand marksmanship, killed the attacking natives. Appropriately for a fantastic story, Major Fothergill rewarded Rosenblum with 1,500 pounds, a British passport and passage to Britain. There Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum. Andrew Cook asserts in Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly (p.32) that the evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil. Cook states that the arrival of Sigmund Rosenblum in London in December 1895 was from France, and was prompted by Rosenblum's unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, a residential suburb of Paris, necessitating a hasty flight. According to Cook's account, Rosenblum and Yan Voitek, a Polish accomplice, waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist's throat was cut; the other, Constant Della Cassa, died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later. By the time Della Cassa's death appeared in the newspapers police had learned that one of the assailants, whose physical description matched Rosenblum's, was already en route to Britain. Rosenblum's accomplice, Voitek, later related this incident as well as other dealings with Rosenblum to the British Secret Intelligence Service.|$|E

2500|$|Pat Long of NME {{wrote that}} Newsom [...] "has managed {{to lessen the}} twee factor of her last record, in the process {{crafting}} an album as bewitching as it is odd."

[...] The Independents Andy Gill wrote that Ys [...] "leaves one in no doubt of her oddball credentials" [...] and [...] "rarely, if ever, has an artist so assiduously cultivated cult status". Among negative assessments, Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard called the album [...] "hard to stomach" [...] and plagued by overlong tracks [...] "with meandering strings-and-things accompaniment and indulgent vocal quirks that make Björk sound like Kelly Clarkson." [...] Robert Christgau, in his [...] "Consumer Guide" [...] column for MSN Music, wrote {{that much of the}} [...] "sprightly" [...] qualities of The Milk-Eyed <b>Mender</b> had been [...] "subsumed here by ambition, to be kind, and privilege, to be brutally accurate", and that the album's songs [...] "reveal only that her taste for the antique is out of control".|$|E
