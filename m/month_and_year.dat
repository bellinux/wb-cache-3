5|$|Authentic was {{pocket book}} size (7.25 × 4.75inches) {{for most of}} its life, {{changing}} to digest size (7.5 × 5.5inches) for the last eight issues. The issue numbering was consecutive from 1 to 85, with no volume numbers. The first issue had a publication date of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth issue to the end Authentic maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the publication date was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

It {{continued}} rising on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number 12 on December 20 of that same year. Later in 1976 due to the album's strong sales, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Lazy Afternoon Gold on April 14, 1976 for shipments of 500,000 copies. In Canada, the album peaked {{at a much lower}} position; it debuted on RPMs official list at number 69 as the week's third highest entry on December 20, 1975. The following <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year,</b> it would reach its peak position at number 42. It also charted in Australia, where it peaked at number 84 according to the Kent Music Report.|$|E

Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a 160-page digest, priced at 35 cents. The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954. The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways. However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, {{and so they are}} now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates. The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number. The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.|$|E

25|$|Time of Day {{metering}} (TOD), {{also known}} as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this {{can be used to}} automatically control usage {{on the part of the}} customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage, or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the utilities to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also Demand-side Management (DSM).|$|E

25|$|The {{cheese is}} put into a {{stainless}} steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20–25 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.|$|E
25|$|About {{the year}} of Shapur's {{participation}} in reign with Ardashir, it has been written in Cologne Mani-Codex in Greek about Mani's life:When I became twenty-four years old; in the year that Persian king, Dari-Ardashir opened the city Hatra, and in the year Shapur Shah, his son, put the largest crown in the month Famuthi, on the month day (8th day of Farmuthi), my god, who is the most blessed, made me proud by his generosity, summoned me by his favor...It can be deduced by calculating the Egyptian <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> that Shapur's coronation as his father's royal partner occurred on April 12, 240 (the {{first day of the}} Babylonian month Nisan in the year 551). Ardashir and Shapur's simultaneous reign lasted apparently until early 242. Therefor, {{it can be said that}} Shapur was probably crowned twice; once as a royal partner in 240 and later in 243 as lonely reign; however it is more probable that he was crowned only once in 240.|$|E
25|$|If {{counting}} {{is measured}} back 17 cycles from Ezekiel's Jubilee {{that began in}} Tishri of 574 BC, {{the first year of}} the first cycle would have been 1406 BC. According to the religious calendar that started the year in Nisan, and in accordance with Joshua 5:10 that places the entry in the land in Nisan, Nisan of 1406 BC is the <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> when counting started. But 1406 BC is the year of entry into the land that is traditionally derived by another method, namely taking Thiele's date of 931/930 BC for the start of the divided kingdom after Solomon's death, in conjunction with 1 Kings 6:1 (Solomon's fourth year was 480th year of Exodus-era), to derive the date of the Exodus in 1446 BC. The method of determining the date of the Exodus and entry into Canaan from the Jubilee cycles is independent of the method of deriving these dates from 1 Kings 6:1, yet the two methods agree.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there were}} white {{characters}} {{on a black}} background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon {{on the right side}} was added with the <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly out of tune with the alphanumeric sequence, and {{the reason for this is}} that these are imported used vehicles.|$|E

Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item, such as a lacquered cup or screen. Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the clan name of the family who owned them.

Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made {{and the name of the}} workshop. Bronze calipers from the Xin dynasty, used for minute measurements, had an inscription stating that it was [...] "made on a gui-you day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the Shijian guo period."

Han lacquerwares bearing the imperial mark of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists, in places such as Qingzhen (in Guizhou), Pyongyang (in North Korea), and Noin Ula (in Mongolia).|$|E
