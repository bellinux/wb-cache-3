50|$|Various petrol engines were used, an 85 hp Napier {{engine was}} the first to be installed, but these were found unsatisfactory, so were {{replaced}} in 1904 by Wolseley engines. These flat-four engines produced 92 bhp at their normal rated speed of 400rpm, and well over 100 bhp when run at 480rpm. The cylinders were 8.5 inch diameter with 10 inch stroke. The engine had a 3-foot diameter flywheel, and was coupled directly to a Westinghouse multi-polar dynamo. A small dynamo driven by belt from the flywheel provided charge for the accumulators which enabled electric starting of the engine, lighting for the carriage, and the exciting current for the field coils in the <b>main</b> <b>dynamo,</b> controlled by rheostats {{at either end of the}} railcar. The engine speed could likewise be controlled via a throttle from either end of the railcar.

30|$|The general {{objective}} of the analysis we presented here is to model different ingredients of the field altogether. The method reported here is the realization. This paper also has also a methodological character; we computed Gauss coefficients of the <b>main</b> (<b>dynamo)</b> field, and computed coefficients of the so-called ring current field. The characteristics of the analysis are the following. To compute a given model of the main field, for example, {{it is possible to}} use for each τ-interval centered on day τ a number of disjoint data sets, each including a rather small (1000, 2400) number of points. In this way, spurious values of coefficient estimates are made conspicuous; this provides a control of the model (g, h) which allows us to release data selection. An advantage of a close time-spacing of the model is to provide time series whose trends can be studied in the usual way.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of the bow shock in {{coupling}} solar wind energy to the magnetosphere using global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction with southward IMF. During typical solar wind conditions, there are two significant dynamo currents in the magnetospheric system, one in the high-latitude mantle region tailward of the cusp and the other in the bow shock. As the magnitude of the (southward) IMF increases and the solar wind becomes a low Mach number flow, there is a significant change in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. The high-latitude magnetopause dynamo becomes insignificant compared to the bow shock and a large load appears right outside the magnetopause. This leaves the bow shock current as the only substantial dynamo current in the system, and the only place where a significant amount of mechanical energy is extracted from the solar wind. That energy appears primarily as electromagnetic energy, and the Poynting flux generated at the bow shock feeds energy back into the plasma, reaccelerating it to solar wind speeds. Some small fraction of that Poynting flux is directed into the magnetosphere, supplying the energy needed for magnetospheric dynamics. Thus during periods when the solar wind flow has a low Mach number, the <b>main</b> <b>dynamo</b> in the solar wind-magnetosphere system is the bow shock...|$|E

40|$|A ship borne {{system for}} {{electric}} supply {{coupled with an}} electric generator and a drive engine gradually decreases its performance year by year even on continuous careful maintenance and arrangements by marine engineers. While a trouble ratio of the total dynamo system in all ship borne machinery generally increases with running duration. The mean trouble ratio is around 10 %. Accordingly, marine engineers should regularly check the system to hold their current states to maintain constant performance. According to Yoshimura et al, the limited load ratio of diesel generators varied with their running duration and are generally given at a range of 60 - 70 % for their constant output. For the T/V Kakuyo-Maru, the electric generator system consists of two main generators of 450 kVA (No 1, No 2) and an auxiliary generator of 100 kVA. The main generators are used alternatively at a suitable interval. The working hours of No. 1 and No. 2 is around 41, 000 h since 1975 when T/V Kakuyo-Maru was built.

The winds are produced by assimilating DYNAMO observations into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) threedimensional variational (3 DVAR) system. Data sources from the DYNAMO campaign include the upperair sounding network, radial velocities from the radar network, vector winds from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Oceansat 2 Scatterometer (OSCAT) satellite instruments, the NOAA High Resolution Doppler Lidar (HRDL), and several others. In order the prep them for 3 DVAR, significant additional quality control work is being done for the currently available TOGA and SMARTR radar datasets, including automatically dealiasing radial velocities and correcting for intermittent TOGA antenna azimuth angle errors. The assimilated winds are being made available as model output fields from WRF on two separate grids with different horizontal resolutions a 3 km grid focusing on the <b>main</b> <b>DYNAMO</b> quadrilateral (i. e., Gan Island, the R/V Revelle, the R/V Mirai, and Diego Garcia), and a 1 km grid focusing on the Revelle.

40|$|Principle {{component}} analysis (PCA) {{of the solar}} background magnetic field (SBMF) measured from Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) magnetograms revealed the following principal components (PCs) in latitudes: two main symmetric components, which are {{the same for all}} cycles 21 - 23, and three pairs of asymmetric components, which are unique for each cycle. These SBMF variations are assumed to be those of poloidal magnetic field travelling slightly offphase from pole to pole while crossing the equator. They are assumed to be caused by a joint action of dipole and quadruple magnetic sources in the Sun. In the current paper, we make the first attempt to interpret these latitudinal variations in the surface magnetic field with Parker's two-layer dynamo model. The latitudinal distributions of such waves are simulated for cycles 21 - 23 by the modified Parker's dynamo model taking into account both ff and ! effects operating simultaneously in the two (upper and lower) layers of the solar convective zone (SCZ) and having opposite directions of meridional circulation. The simulations are carried out for both dipole and quadruple magnetic sources with the dynamo parameters specifically selected to provide the curves fitting closely the PCs derived from SBMF variations in cycles 21 - 23. The simulations are optimised for matching the positions of maximums in latitude, the number of equator crossings and the phase difference between the two dynamo waves operating in the two layers. The dominant pair of PCs present in each cycle is found to be fully asymmetric with respect to the magnetic poles and produced by a magnetic dipole. This pair is found to account for the two <b>main</b> <b>dynamo</b> waves operating between the two magnetic poles. There are also three further pairs of waves unique to each cycle and associated with multiple magnetic sources in the Sun. For the odd cycle 21 the simulated poloidal field fits the observed PCs, only if they are produced by magnetic sources with a quadruple symmetry in both layers, while for the even cycle 22 the fit to the observed PCs is achieved only in the case of quadruple magnetic sources in the upper layer and dipole sources in the inner layer. For the other odd cycle 23 the fit to observation is obtained for the quadruple magnetic sources in the inner layer and the dipole sources in the upper layer. The magnitudes of dynamo numbers D defining the conditions (depth and latitude) of a magnetic flux formation and the numbers N of zeros (equator crossings by the waves) are found to increase and the meridional circulation speed to decrease with a cycle number increase (D =- 700, N = 3 for cycle 21 and D =- 10 (4), N = 9 for cycle 23). The phase delays between the waves in each unique pairs are also found to increase with the cycle number from similar to 9 degrees in cycle 21 to similar to 13 degrees in cycle 23...|$|E

40|$|Stellar {{rotation}} {{plays an}} important role in maintaining the magnetic fields inside the stellar interior through convection, and starspots are the most visible manifestation of the interplay between stellar rotation rate and magnetic fields. It is revealed through high end observations of evolution of magnetic fields and rotation rate of the Sun and other solar type stars that they exhibit a wide range of variation among their rotation rates yet there are some common ingredients such as rotational shear, turbulent transport and various nonlinear transport mechanisms which contribute towards the evolution and maintenance of the magnetic activity displayed by them. Also, these observations provide us with valuable information about the dependence of differential rotation and magnetic activity on rotation rate of stars with different ages and different rotation rates. Thus, the <b>main</b> challenge in <b>dynamo</b> theory is to explain these observations which is in fact a very strenuous problem and is challenging to do with full MHD simulations due to the various constraints such as expensive computations in terms of time and resolution. Therefore, it is useful to construct a simple parameterized model in order to understand the evolution of rotation rate and magnetic fields which can provide valuable insight into the various observations. This thesis discusses the modelling of solar dynamo and spindown of solar-type stars by using ODE and the effect of shear in kinematic dynamo in full MHD. We propose a simple parameterized model to understand the effect of nonlinear transport coefficients as well as mean/fluctuating differential rotation in the generation and destruction of magnetic fields and their capability in the working of dynamo near marginal stability. This model is then utilised to discuss detailed dynamics to understand the self-regulation of magnetic fields in solar/stellar dynamo. This work is further extended to understand the spindown of solar-type stars where the angular momentum loss is dynamically prescribed via equation of evolution of rotation rate and magnetic fields. The results obtained from this model are consistent with observations. Furthermore, regulatory behaviour of a kinematic dynamo by shear flow is investigated. Specifically, we study the induction equation by prescribing small scale velocity field to which a large scale radial/latitudinal shear is added in the direction of zonal flow. The results from numerical simulations are analysed and we conclude that the presence of large scale shear suppresses the small scale flows and results in quenching of a kinematic dynamo...|$|R
