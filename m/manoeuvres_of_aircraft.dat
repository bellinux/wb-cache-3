The proposed models have been formulated in order to account for the effects of different reference conditions of steady braking on gains, zeros and poles of such transfer functions...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{methodology}} {{for evaluating the}} impact from manoeuvre loads, in the life assessment of the front frame in the RM 12 engine, has been developed. Analyses with real mission data were performed, using both the recently developed FE-model of the entire engine together with an independent FE-model of the front frame, {{in order to determine}} the damage supplement in the component due to <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft.</b> These indications will facilitate the engineers at GKN Aerospace in future life assessments, not only for the front frame but all static components in the engine. It was found that including the loads, due to <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft,</b> resulted in over twice the damage in the front frame when compared to the damage due to the axial loading induced by differences between the atmospheric pressure and the air pressure within the engine. However these results were not achieved at such nodal locations having the highest stress levels and therefore the manoeuvre loads might have even more impact on the damage of the analysed component.

Records of undirected take-offs made in real flight and on the simulator have been compared, and these, as well as pilot's subjective opinions, show that the simulation was adequate for its purpose. The need for cockpit motion and visual simulation was studied briefly. Tests with one suggested form of take-off director showed that take-offs with the director were more consistent, and had increased margins of safety, compared with undirected take-offs...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} difficulties in determining the <b>manoeuvring</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a slender body through a fluid. This work has direct applicability {{in many areas of}} hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. For example the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> ships and submarines through water or the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> missiles or <b>aircraft</b> through the atmosphere for cases where the compressibility of the air is not a significant factor. The research is approached by looking at both a slender body theory in potential flow (inviscid) and a slender body theory in Oseen flow (viscous). The differences between these two approaches are considered and the force expressions are found for both cases. This work gives rise to a discrepancy between the lift force expressions (sometimes referred to as the normal or side force) for the two approaches which leads to some interesting comparisons and conclusions. This discrepancy in the lift force calculation has in fact been noticed separately by both aerodynamicists, Alien [3], and hydrodynamicists, Clarke [12] and Newman [27]. The work presented here looks at the reasons for this force discrepancy and links slender wing theory and slender body theory together. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the gust response and wing structure load alleviation of a 200 -seater aircraft by employing a passive twist wingtip (PTWT). The research was divided into three stages. The first stage was the design and analysis <b>of</b> the baseline <b>aircraft,</b> including aerodynamic analysis, structural design using the finite element (FE) method and flutter analysis to meet the design requirements. Dynamic response analysis <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> to discrete (one-cosin) gust was also performed in a range of gust radiances specified in the airworthiness standards. In the second stage, a PTWT of a length of 1. 13 m was designed with the key parameters determined based on design constraints and, in particular, the aeroelastic stability and gust response. Subsequent gust response analysis was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the PTWT for gust alleviation. The results show that the PTWT produced a significant reduction of gust-induced wingtip deflection by 21 % and the bending moment at the wing root by 14 % in the most critical flight case. In the third stage, effort was made to study the interaction and influence of the PTWT on the symmetric and unsymmetrical <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> when ailerons were in operation. The results show the that PTWT influence with a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> normal velocity and heave motion by 1. 7 % and 3 %, respectively, is negligible. However, the PTWT influence on the aircraft roll moment with a 20. 5 % reduction is significant. A locking system is therefore required in such a manoeuvring condition. The investigation has shown that the PTWT is an effective means for gust alleviation and, therefore, has potential for large aircraft application...|$|R
25|$|On day {{two of the}} inquiry, Major Cooper gave {{evidence}} in respect of the flight <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft,</b> {{based on interviews with}} between 100 and 150 witnesses. He stated that the final <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> was consistent with the pilot experiencing engine trouble and attempting to return to Croydon Airport. He stated {{that it was impossible to}} state that the engine had suffered a partial failure due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had been away from Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licensed engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with fresh oil. The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as fit for use in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} CFD {{has become a}} widely {{accepted}} tool in the aerospace community {{after it has been}} validated for a wide area of test cases. This {{can be seen as a}} pre-requisite enabling the introduction of coupled multi-disciplinary simulation methods involving a higher level of CFD tools than currently used in industry. A necessary condition for the acceptance of such tools in industry is, of course, their verification and validation using suitable multi-physics test cases. The current paper presents a brief overview over some recent DLR projects dealing with implementation and validation of multi-disciplinary simulation tools. The areas of multi-physics considered in these projects reach from the fluid-structure coupling (a two degree-of-freedom airfoil exhibiting Limit Cycle Oscillations, the aero-elastic coupling of an engine to a wing and the simulation of helicopter blades) over thermal coupling of flow and structure (flaps of a generic reentry vehicle to the coupling of flow, structures and flight mechanics (<b>manoeuvre</b> simulation <b>of</b> flexible <b>aircraft)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{in civil}} {{airspace}} is restricted by the aviation authorities which require full compliance with regulations that apply for manned aircraft. This thesis proposes control algorithms for a {{collision avoidance system}} {{that can be used}} as an advisory system or a guidance system for UAVs that are flying in civil airspace under visual flight rules. An effective collision avoidance system for the UAV should be able to perform the different functionalities of the pilot in manned aircraft. Thus, it should be able to determine, generate, and perform safe avoidance manoeuvres. However, the capability to generate resolution advisories is crucial for the advisory systems. A decision making system for collision avoidance is developed based on the rules of the air. The proposed architecture of the decision making system is engineered to be implementable in both manned aircraft and UAVs to perform different tasks ranging from collision detection to a safe avoidance manoeuvre initiation. Avoidance manoeuvres that are compliant with the rules of the air are proposed based on pilot suggestions for a subset of possible collision scenarios. The avoidance manoeuvre generation algorithm is augmented with pilot experience by using fuzzy logic technique to model pilot actions in generating the avoidance manoeuvres. Hence, the generated avoidance manoeuvres mimic the avoidance <b>manoeuvres</b> <b>of</b> manned <b>aircraft.</b> The proposed avoidance manoeuvres are parameterized using a geometric approach. An optimal collision avoidance algorithm is developed for real-time local trajectory planning. Essentially, a finite-horizon optimal control problem is periodically solved in real-time hence updating the aircraft trajectory to avoid obstacles and track a predefined trajectory. The optimal control problem is formulated in output space, and parameterised by using B-splines. Then the optimal designed outputs are mapped into control inputs of the system by using the inverse dynamics of a fixed wing aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper describes a new low parameter mathematical model representing the force and moment components generated in an aircraft tyre for use in the computer simulation of takeoff, landing and taxiing <b>manoeuvres</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft.</b> As such the problems addressed fall in the area of ground vehicle dynamics and the modelling of the tyre presents similar challenges to those involved in modelling automotive tyres, albeit on a much larger scale in terms of the size and the loads on the tyre. The model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment and designed to run initially with aircraftmodels defined by the industry standard multi-body systems program MSC. ADAMS (TM). An overview is provided of current automotive and aircraft tyre models along with a critique of the application and capabilities of these existing models for aircraftsimulation. The need for a model which can be used to fit the limited range of data available for aircraft tyres, compared with automotive tyres, is also discussed. The proposed low parameter tyre model (LPTM) uses a small set of model parameters that can be obtained without recourse to special software and can be easily manipulated to fit the model to available tyre test data. The model has been exercised and compared with two existing tyre models, using a multi-body computer model of a tyre test machine and has been shown to produce improved predictions of the important forces and moments generated in a tyre contact patch when validated against test data. The evaluation at this stage is related to the tyre characteristics needed to simulate vehicle braking and cornering manoeuvres and the validation is against available test data for the lateral force and aligning moment arising due to slip angle...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{some of the}} current results of the "Aerodynamic Simulation <b>of</b> Unsteady <b>Manoeuvres</b> (AeroSUM) " project, of the Institute of Design Aerodynamics at DLR, will be presented. The main focus of the project is the {{numerical}} simulation <b>of</b> unsteady <b>manoeuvres</b> <b>of</b> fighter <b>aircraft.</b> The main objective of the simulation is the coupling of aerodynamic and flight-mechanic interactions. The numerical simulation is performed with an unstructured, time accurate Navier-Stokes flow solver, TAU, which has been developed by DLR. For the coupling between the aerodynamics and flight-mechanics, the mechanical-system simulation tool SIMPACK is used, {{in conjunction with the}} flow solver. For the validation {{of the results of the}} numerical simulation software, comparisons to experimental data will be performed. The experimental data will be obtained from extensive wind-tunnel testing of a generic delta-wing aircraft model. The AeroSUM wind-tunnel model is a cropped-delta-wing configuration consisting of a fuselage and wings with trailing edge flaps. It is specifically designed for testing in the "Transonic Wind-Tunnel Göttingen (TWG) ". The experimental set-up is capable of simulating both controlled and free-to-roll manoeuvres, at various angles-of-attack, as well as static flight conditions. In this paper some of the results of three separate flight conditions/manoeuvres will be presented. First of all, several Static Flight results will be presented to show the static flight-mechanic behaviour of the configuration, and the structure of the vortex dominated flow-field due to the angle-of-attack and roll-angle. Results of surface pressure and roll-moment will be shown to compare favourably with the experimental data. The static simulation cases are the starting points for the unsteady simulations. The second test-case is Transient Flight. The aircraft is set in a periodic roll-motion, with a given amplitude in roll-angle and frequency. Results of surface pressure and roll-moment and several roll-angle locations will be shown to have good agreement with the experimental data. Finally we will present results of a coupled simulation, i. e. a free-roll manoeuvre. The aircraft is released from an initial angle-of-attack and roll-angle, and allowed to freely roll into a trim-point where it is stable. Results of surface pressure, roll-moment, and trim-point, for both high and low angles-of-attack, will be shown to have good comparison with the experimental data. The desired manoeuvrability capabilities <b>of</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> keep increasing, thus the design and development <b>of</b> such <b>aircraft</b> become ever more complex. It is hoped that the use of coupled simulation-packages like TAU-SIMPACK will assist in keeping the complexity <b>of</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> development at a manageable level for years to come. Therefore, the final aim of the project is the capability to simulate a fully configured, manoeuvring fighter aircraft, i. e. an aircraft with several control-surfaces and thrust-vector devices...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a pilot override control system that prevents aircraft entering critical regions of space, known as prohibited volumes. The aim is to prevent another 9 / 11 style terrorist attack, as well as act as a general safety system for transport aircraft. The thesis presents the design and implementation of three core modules in the system; the trajectory generation algorithm, the trigger mechanism for the pilot override and the trajectory following element. The trajectory generation algorithm uses a direct multiple shooting strategy to provide trajectories through online computation that avoid pre-defi ned prohibited volume exclusion regions, whilst accounting for the <b>manoeuvring</b> capabilities <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft.</b> The trigger mechanism incorporates the logic that decides the time at which it is suitable for the override to be activated, an important consideration for ensuring that the system is not overly restrictive for a pilot. A number of methods are introduced, and for safety purposes a composite trigger that incorporates di fferent strategies is recommended. Trajectory following is best achieved via a nonlinear guidance law. The guidance logic sends commands in pitch, roll and yaw to the control surfaces <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft,</b> in order to closely follow the generated avoidance trajectory. Testing and validation is performed using a full motion simulator, with volunteers flying a representative aircraft model and attempting to penetrate prohibited volumes. The proof-of-concept system is shown to work well, provided that extreme aircraft manoeuvres are prevented near the exclusion regions. These hard manoeuvring envelope constraints allow the trajectory following controllers to follow avoidance trajectories accurately from an initial state within the bounding set. In order to move the project closer to a commercial product, operator and regulator input is necessary, particularly due to the radical nature of the pilot override system.
