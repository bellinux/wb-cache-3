5|$|The two-player {{option was}} {{inspired}} by then-current games Populous and Stunt Car Racer. DMA Design initially wanted to use a null-modem connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using {{the ability of the}} Amiga to have two <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> devices usable {{at the same time and}} thus created the split-screen mode.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> is held over game elements.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft Office 2007 also {{introduces}} a feature called Live Preview, which temporarily applies formatting on the focused text or object when any formatting button is moused-over. The temporary formatting is removed when the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> is {{moved from the}} button. This allows users to have a preview of how the option would affect {{the appearance of the}} object, without actually applying it.|$|E
25|$|Many TV tuner/capture cards include remote {{controls}} {{for use with}} the applications included with the card. Software such as Boxee, GB-PVR, SageTV, MediaPortal and Beyond TV {{support the use of}} Windows MCE and other {{remote controls}}. Another option is an in-air <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> like the Wii Remote, GlideTV Navigator, or Loop Pointer which gives cursor control from a distance. It is also possible to utilize common wireless keyboards and other peripherals to achieve the same effect (though the range may not be as long as a typical remote control's).|$|E
25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or step over it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> hovers over any variable, its current value is displayed in a tooltip ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E

25|$|Electronic paper {{technologies}} {{have a very}} low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCD. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, <b>mouse</b> <b>pointers</b> or scrolling) like those common on standard mobile devices. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.|$|R

For example, a symbol of a pump can show the operator that the pump is running, and a flow meter symbol can show how much fluid it is pumping through the pipe. The operator can switch the pump off from the mimic by a mouse click or screen touch. The HMI will show the flow rate of the fluid in the pipe decrease in real time.|$|R

However, Bruce Tognazzini, former employee of Apple Inc. and human computer interaction professional, claims that the Mac OS's menu bars can be accessed up to five times faster due to Fitts's law: because the menu bar lies on a screen edge, it effectively has an infinite height — Mac users can just [...] "throw" [...] their <b>mouse</b> <b>pointers</b> {{toward the top of}} the screen with the assurance that it will never overshoot the menu bar and disappear.|$|R

For web accessibility reasons, it is often important – and in some cases it may even be a legal or contractual requirement – to provide an alt attribute describing the link that screen reader software can read to, for example, blind users.|$|E
2500|$|The new Mini Toolbar {{is a small}} toolbar {{with basic}} {{formatting}} commands that appears within the document editing area, much like a context menu. When the mouse selects part of the text, Mini Toolbar appears close to selected text. It remains semi-transparent until the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> is hovered on it, to avoid obstructing what is underneath. Mini Toolbar can also be made to appear by right-clicking in the editing area or via [...] key on keyboard, in which case it appears near the cursor, above or below the traditional context menu. Mini Toolbar is not customizable in Office 2007, but can be turned off.|$|E

Normal applications cannot interact with the Secure Desktop. This helps prevent spoofing, such as overlaying different text or graphics {{on top of the}} elevation request, or tweaking the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> to click the confirmation button when that's not what the user intended. If an administrative activity comes from a minimized application, the secure desktop request will also be minimized so as to prevent the focus from being lost.

Players control their movement and shooting separately using dual guns for both hands. For two-hand usage, we designed a display method for multiple <b>mouse</b> <b>pointers.</b> First, we loaded typical physical driver into the memory and registered our developed multiple mouse device driver instead of the existing MS Windows device driver. We then executed both message loop procedures for Windows mouse event handling and those for multiple mouse event handling. We could display multiple mouse cursor images and utilize both mouse devices separately. After that, a prototype game using both hands was developed for an experimental study...|$|R

50|$|Stonekeep is a first-person RPG in {{the style}} of Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. The game is set in a series of {{underground}} labyrinths, filled with monsters, treasures and traps. The player uses the directional keys on the keyboard for movement and typing in notes in the journal and uses the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> to interact with objects and characters. The <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> is usually a target indicator for aiming attacks and weapons wherever it is clicked. When the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> is moved onto a particular something it changes to another icon to indicate a different action. For example, the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> changes to an eye when the player can examine things (often signs) or the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer</b> changes into a spread-out hand when the player can pick up items. Other mouse pointers include opening and closing chests, opening and closing panels, pulling levers and switches, pressing buttons, drinking water and giving items.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for programming {{graphical user interfaces}} (GUIs), called PIDGETS++, is presented. PIDGETS++ enables arbitrary device-independent PostScript graphics descriptions to be composed and manipulated as structured C++ objects. Not only can graphics descriptions be displayed in windows, additionally, they can be equipped with handlers which are invoked whenever a user event occurs while the <b>mouse</b> <b>pointer's</b> hot spot is over the area colored by the graphics description. Thus, arbitrary GUI objects may be constructed as composite graphics descriptions. Moreover, GUI objects are amenable to arbitrary PostScript transformations such as coloring, rotation, scaling, and clipping while staying fully functional. GUI objects are constructed in a declarative style. At {{the time of its}} creation, each GUI object's appearance is constrained to be a function of the states of a set of other objects; this constraint is maintained by the PIDGETS++ system throughout the GUI object's lifetime.

40|$|Most {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} provide visual cursors to facilitate interaction with input devices such as <b>mice,</b> <b>pointers,</b> and pens. These cursors often include directional cues that could influence the stimulus-response compatibility of user input. We conducted a controlled evaluation of four cursor orientations and an orientationneutral cursor in a circular menu selection task. Mouse interaction on a desktop, pointer (i. e. wand) interaction on a large screen, and pen interaction on a Tablet PC were evaluated. Our results suggest that choosing appropriate cursors {{is especially important for}} pointer interaction, but may be less important for mice or pens. Cursors oriented toward the lower-right corner of a display yielded the poorest performance overall while orientation-neutral cursors were generally the best. Advantages were found for orientations aligned with the direction of movement. We discuss these results and suggest guidelines for the appropriate use of cursors in various input and display configurations...|$|R
40|$|Mental {{representations}} form {{a useful}} theoretical {{framework for understanding}} the integration, separation and mediation of visual perception and motor action from a computational perspective. In the study of human-computer interaction (HCI), knowledge of mental representations {{could be used to}} improve the design and evaluation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and interactive systems. This thesis presents a representational approach to the study of user performance and shows how the use of mental representations for perception and action complements existing information processing frameworks in HCI. Three major representational theories are highlighted as evidence supporting this approach: (1) the phenomenon of stimulus-response compatibility is examined in relation to directional cursor cues for GUI interaction with <b>mice,</b> <b>pointers,</b> and pens; (2) the functional specialization of the upper and lower visual fields is explored with respect to mouse and touchscreen item selection; (3) the two-visual systems hypothesis is studied in the context of distal pointing and visual feedback for large-screen interaction. User interface design guidelines based on each of these representational themes are provided and the broader implications of...|$|R
