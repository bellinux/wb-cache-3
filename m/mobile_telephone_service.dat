2500|$|Before the {{existence}} of cell phones, Improved <b>Mobile</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> (IMTS) was offered. As of 1983, three VHF and two UHF channels were available. Subscribers had either a VHF or UHF vehicle-mounted phone, consequently they could access {{only two or three}} channels over the entire San Jose area.

The VHF equipment was located near the Santa Clara Valley Water District's Rinconada Water Treatment Plant on More Avenue at NAD27 coordinates [...] The IMTS system included General Electric mobile radio voting equipment. (Voting is a form of diversity combining used in mobile radio systems on land.)

40|$|This article studies bidding {{behaviour}} in the auction of radio spectrum for third generation <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> {{which took place}} in the UK in the Spring of 2000. We show that several companies {{bidding behaviour}} deviates strongly from straightforward bidding with private values. In particular some companies evaluation of the added advantage of having a large licence rather than a small licence seemed to change dramatically during the auction. No compelling explanation of this phenomenon seems available at this stage. We conclude that it is less well understood than previously believed how spectrum auctions work. Many countries around the world have recently used auctions to award licences for the operation of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services.</b> A variety of different auction formats have been employed. The experience from these auctions provides a wealth of information which can be used to assess the appropriateness of dif-ferent auction formats for the award of licences in the <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> and other sectors.
