40|$|For organic {{electronic}} device applications materials are needed which display good charge carrier mobility, good processability, and stability towards oxygen and moisture. Alkynylated N-Heteroacenes fulfill {{many of these}} requirements. Substitution with alkyne {{groups as well as}} the introduction of the pyrazine subunit both inhibits oxidative degradation at sensitive position in the molecules. Additionally the trialkylsilylethynyl group aides in directing the packing motif as well as vastly increases the solubility over unsubstituted analogues. 	A requisite precursor in the synthesis of alkynylated N-heteroacenes is alkynylated acenothiadiazoles. These thiadiazoles display interesting photophysical properties and can be functionalized to produce a wide range of properties in closely related materials. The acenothiadiazoles themselves have potential applications as an N-type semiconductor. Optical gaps and calculated HOMO-LUMO gaps show that these molecules, when compared to known N-type materials, should be easily injected with electrons. Additionally the crystal packing of these compounds shows favorable π-orbital overlap which should provide excellent charge carrier <b>mobilities.</b> Ph.

40|$|Animals {{effectively}} {{move and}} negotiate {{a variety of}} environments exemplifying the neuromuscular system's ability to produce complex coordinated movements. Our central thesis is that the nonlinear dynamical properties of muscle {{play a critical role}} in power production and stability during such movements. We have developed a closed-loop system that couples an isolated muscle to a physical or computational load, facilitating the study of the interactions between intrinsic muscle properties and external forces. We used this system to determine how elastic elements in the frog semimembranosus can improve power production during a jumping task and how the contractile element automatically manages energy to maintain a stable bouncing gait. Our results reveal that, during ballistic movements (e. g. jumping), series elastic elements stretch and shorten to temporally concentrate energy transfer from the contractile element to the body, amplifying power production. We measured peak instantaneous power greater than twice the maximum power the contractile element could produce alone. Our results show how, during a bouncing gait, the contractile and elastic elements autonomously interact to produce, dissipate, and recycle energy and to maintain dynamic stability without sensory feedback. Our data suggest that muscles can recover over 75 % of the kinematic energy from one step and apply it to the next. These results demonstrate the effects and importance of intrinsic muscle properties during movements. Ultimately, this research can guide the development of biomimetic robotic and prosthetic technologies capable of life-like <b>mobility.</b> Ph.

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} and oligomers {{are great}} materials {{for use in}} the next generation devices namely organic field effect transistors, light emitting diodes and polymeric solar cells. Apart from having the potential for developing power-efficient, flexible, robust and inexpensive devices, conjugated polymers can also be tuned by molecular design to optimize device characteristics. One key problem for the full commercial exploitation of conjugated polymers is that the charge carrier mobility of the state-of-the-art polymer semiconductors is much lower than required for many applications. The performance of the devices is strongly dependent on the molecular structure and supermolecular assembly of the conjugated polymer chains. This thesis covers our attempts to design molecular structure to control and improve the solid state properties of conjugated polymers. 	The relative placement of side chains along the backbone has a great influence on the solid state ordering of conjugated polymers. Poly(2, 5 -disubstituted- 1, 4 -phenylene ethynylene) s (PPE) s, an important class of conjugated polymers, are generally synthesized by Pd-catalyzed coupling polymerizations of appropriately substituted diiodo and diethynyl benzenes (i. e., A-A and B-B type monomers). In asymmetrically substituted PPEs, this results in an irregular substitution pattern of the side chains along the polymer backbone. We report a new synthetic approach to prepare regioregular unsymmetrically substituted PPEs by polymerization of 4 -iodophenylacetylenes (i. e., A-B type monomer). We provide a detailed discussion of various approaches to the synthesis of PPEs with different regioregularities and provide a description of the differences between regioregular and regiorandom analogs. 	The effect of regioregularity becomes even more important when the two side chains are very dissimilar or amphiphilic. We explore the effect of relative placement hydrophobic (dodecyloxy) / hydrophilic (tri(ethylene glycol) and hydrophobic (dodecyloxy) /fluorophilic (fluoroalkyl) side chains along the poly(1, 4 -phenylene ethynylene) backbone. We found that the regioregular substitution of the polymer backbone provides a structure in which the side chains segregate to afford a Janus-type structure. The regioregular polymer chains pack more densely in a monolayer at the air-water interface, and pack into a bilayer in the solid state to form a highly crystalline material. Pentacenes are very important organic molecules for use as semiconductor in oFETs due to their low band gap and high field effect mobility. One approach to reduce the bandgap of a polymeric system and improve performance is to include low bandgap small molecules into the conjugated backbone. A new copolymer system consisting of pentacene and terthiophene was developed and its optical and electronic properties along with its stability were evaluated. We report the use of ultrasonication of P 3 HT as a novel operationally-simple process to significantly improve the field effect mobility of P 3 HT-based FETs, thereby potentially eliminating the need for dielectric surface modifications or further processing of the device. Investigation of the sonicated polymer samples by number of characterization techniques indicates that ultrasonication leads to aggregation and ordering of the P 3 HT chains resulting in increase in the <b>mobility.</b> Ph.
