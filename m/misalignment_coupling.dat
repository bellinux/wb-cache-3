This pump was the key piece of equipment in this process which maintained the surface quality of the hot rolled band steel. Over a period of three years one pump continued to work normally, but the other pump vibrated vigorously. The motor, pump and the other system equipment were changed repeatedly, but the abnormal vibration was not eliminated. Vibration data from the two pumps was obtained， the modulation phenomenon existed in the vibration signal caused by the gear <b>coupling</b> <b>misalignment</b> was found, thus the envelope analysis based on the Hilbert transform was presented to demodulate the vibration signal. The frequency spectrum of the demodulated signal showed that the second order frequency characteristic was more obvious, which effectively revealed the fault information related with the gear <b>coupling</b> <b>misalignment.</b> It was found that the abnormal vibration was caused by <b>coupling</b> <b>misalignment</b> between the motor and the pump. After applying a more advanced alignment technique to thoroughly eliminate the <b>misalignment</b> in the <b>coupling,</b> the vibration was considerably reduced and the pump could work normally.

40|$|A rattleback is a rigid, semi-elliptic toy which {{exhibits}} unintuitive behavior; {{when it is}} spun in one direction, it soon begins {{pitching and}} stops spinning, then it starts to spin in the opposite direction, but in the other direction, it seems to spin just steadily. This puzzling behavior results from the slight misalignment between the principal axes for the inertia and those for the curvature; the <b>misalignment</b> <b>couples</b> the spinning with the pitching and the rolling oscillations. It {{has been shown that}} under the no-slip condition and without dissipation the spin can reverse in both directions, and Garcia and Hubbard obtained the formula for the time required for the spin reversal $t_r$ [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 418, 165 - 197 (1988) ]. In this work, we reformulate the rattleback dynamics in a physically transparent way and reduce it to a three-variable dynamics for spinning, pitching, and rolling. We obtain an expression of the Garcia-Hubbard formula for $t_r$ by a simple product of four factors: (1) the misalignment angle, (2) the difference in the inverses of inertia moment for the two oscillations, (3) that in the radii for the two principal curvatures, and (4) the squared frequency of the oscillation. We perform extensive numerical simulations to examine validity and limitation of the formula, and find that (1) the Garcia-Hubbard formula is good for both spinning directions in the small spin and small oscillation regime, but (2) in the fast spin regime especially for the steady direction, the rattleback may not reverse and shows a rich variety of dynamics including steady spinning, spin wobbling, and chaotic behavior reminiscent of chaos in a dissipative system.

40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery having couplings between the shafts. Ideal alignment is a chimera and the coupling flanges of the shafts are never ideally aligned, presenting angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset).

For a typical 20 -µm radius, vertically coupled microring calculations reveal a linear relationship between deviation in the coupling coefficient and lateral <b>misalignment.</b> A <b>coupling</b> coefficient reduction of 50 % is predicted for a lateral misalignment of 0. 3 µm, which is typical for an alignment accuracy limited by the current state-of-the-art mask alignment process. The use of a wide multimode bus waveguide is proposed to ameliorate this alignment sensitivity. The mode-expanded bus waveguide, together with its physically wider structure, reduces the dependence of modal overlap and coupling length on precise alignment, resulting in significantly relaxed fabrication tolerance. Deviation of coupling coefficient decreases by an order of magnitude for the new ring coupler geometry, where a sole reduction of 5 % is obtained for the same amount of misalignment. The implications of the proposed structure are subsequently investigated for microring laser performance. The differential slope efficiency is shown to be at least five times less sensitive to lateral misalignment for the proposed structure within a small misalignment regime. This readily adaptable coupler geometry based on existing vertical coupling architectures is transferable to any fabrication scheme with multiple waveguide layers coupled vertically, and is of particular importance to microring resonators with small radii...|$|R

Two sepa-rate pairs of coils have been utilized for inductive power and for-ward data transmission, plus a pair of miniature antennas for back telemetry. One major challenge, however, is to minimize the inter-ference among these carriers especially on the implantable side, where size and power are highly limited. Planar power coils with spiral shape are optimized in geometry to provide maximum cou-pling coefficient. The data coils are designed rectangular in shape and wound across the power coils diameter to be oriented per-pendicular to the power coil planes.

These studies focused on the velocity and attenuation of low frequency ultrasound through a carrot sample; these results yielded a degree of ambiguity when attempting to identify a carrot texture. In our research, we attempted to characterize the texture of a carrot, based upon its frequency response. Research showed that there are a number of sources of variation when imaging a carrot. First, the response of the transducer itself can vary. Replications of the same sample also yield varied results. This is a result of problems such as transducer <b>misalignment,</b> or <b>coupling.</b> Imaging different segments of a carrot can be a significant source of error. By far, the largest source of variation came from the imaging samples from different carrots. This variation is partly due to different transducer coupling, and possible non-uniform cooking. Also, to an unknown extent, slight differences in cell biology among different carrots also contributes to this high variation. A response look up table was compiled for carrots cooked. 5 to 16 minutes. When an attempt was made to identify the cooking times of 10 unknown samples, 4 of them were correctly identified. This inaccuracy in matching is due to high sources of variation noted above. A more customized matching program could yield better results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Vibrations {{are found}} almost {{everywhere}} in rotating machines. Rotating machinery vibrates due to unbalances, misalignments and imperfect bearings. Vibrational analysis of rotating machinery {{is able to}} identify {{a large number of}} system ills. Shaft bow, shaft unbalance and <b>coupling</b> <b>misalignments</b> make up the major portion of the observed vibrational frequency spectra of rotating machinery. These vibrational spectra can be used to determine the type of rotating system abnormality. Unbalance is the most cause of machine vibration, an unbalanced rotor always cause more vibration and generates excessive force in the bearing area and reduces the life of the machine. In this paper, experimental studies were performed on a rotor to predict the unbalance in rotor. The vibration velocities were measured at five different speeds using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) at initial condition. Based on vibration readings spectrum analysis and phase analysis was carried out to determine the cause of high vibrations. By observing the spectrum unbalance was identified. Then Rotor was balanced and found that vibrations were reduced [...] The experimental frequency spectra were obtained for both balanced and unbalanced condition under different unbalanced forces at different speed conditions.

40|$|The jet-slot {{oscillator}} is {{a source}} of aeroacoustic self-sustained tones resulting from the impingement of the vortical structures of a plane jet onto a slotted plate. The coupling of this type of aeroacoustic source with high-order acoustic resonances of the flow-supply duct is experimentally studied, in the particular case where the jet-exit and the obstacle are misaligned in the spanwise direction. An experimental setup based on microphones and hot-wire probes is used to investigate this coupling. It is shown that: (i) the misaligned jet-slot oscillator can be coupled to non-planar (transverse) modes of the flow-supply duct, (ii) the vortex tubes spanwise morphology is governed by the phase pattern of the excited modes, and (iii) the impingement of the vortices on the inclined obstacle tends to occur in phase in the spanwise direction, in order to enhance the coherence of the interaction along the slot. An investigation of the excited modes {{as a function of the}} plate inclination angle and of the streamwise slot position was then conducted.

The device {{is based on}} a silica glass on silicon substrate. A novel fabrication approach using a precision dicing saw is used, which has benefits in terms of cost, fabrication time and energy consumption compared to cleanroom based lithography techniques. The silica cantilevers contain integrated optical waveguides and Bragg gratings fabricated using a Direct UV Writing process. The cantilevers are deflected out of plane by thin film stress effects, providing a suitable geometry for use in sensing. Displacement causes both cantilevers to move simultaneously resulting in variable coupling due to the angular alignment of the waveguide modes. Using a developed ratiometric approach based on fitting to Gaussian apodized Bragg gratings, the measured displacement is completely independent of fluctuations in light source power as well as insensitive to detector noise. The device is optically interrogated at a wavelength band around 1550 nm. As a sensor the device has a sensitivity of 0. 8 dB/micron and can be accurately modelled using fiber optic <b>coupling</b> <b>misalignment</b> theory.

40|$|Scrupulous {{measurements}} and detailed data {{analysis of the}} torque in a swirling turbulent flow driven by counter-rotating bladed disks reveals an apparent breaking {{of the law of}} similarity. Potentially, such breakdown could arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as temperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed that this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed to frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute <b>misalignments</b> can nonlinearly <b>couple</b> to the torque signal and provide a dc offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we significantly modified the experimental setup and carried out the experiment with one bladed disk where the disk, torque meter and motor shaft axes can be aligned with significantly smaller error, close to the torque meter resolution. As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity of the small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several water-glycerin solutions of different viscosities and confirmed the similarity law {{in a wide range of}} Re in particular in low viscosity fluids.

40|$|Misalignment in {{turbomachinery}} {{has been}} commonly known to produce twotimes- running-speed (2 N) response. This project aimed {{to investigate the}} source of the 2 N vibration response seen in misaligned vibrating machinery by simulating <b>misalignment</b> through a <b>coupling.</b> Three flexible disc-pack couplings (4 -bolt, 6 -bolt, and 8 -bolt coupling) were modeled, and parallel and angular misalignments were simulated using a finite element program. The stiffness terms obtained from the coupling simulations had 1 N, 2 N, and 3 N harmonic components. The 4 -bolt coupling had large 1 N reaction components under angular and parallel misalignment. The 6 -bolt coupling model only had a 1 N reaction component under angular misalignment, and both cases of parallel misalignment showed a strong 2 N reaction component, larger than both the 1 N and 3 N components. The 8 -bolt coupling model under angular misalignment produced large 1 N reaction components. Under parallel misalignment, it produced 1 N, 2 N, and 3 N components that were similar in magnitude. All the couplings behaved linearly in the range studied. A simple model predicted that the 2 N frequency seen in the response is caused by the harmonic (1 N) term in the stiffness. The amplitude of the 2 N component in the response depends on the amplitude of the 1 N term in the stiffness compared to the average value of the stiffness and the frequency ratio. The rotordynamic response of a parallel and angular misaligned system was completed in XLTRC 2. When the frequency ratio was 0. 5, the system response with the 4 -bolt and 6 -bolt coupling had a synchronous 1 N component that was much larger than the 2 N component. The response did not have a 2 N component when the 8 -bolt coupling was used but the response did have a 1. 6 N component that was considerably larger than the 1 N component. When the frequency ratio was 2, the system response with the 4 -bolt and 6 -bolt coupling had a synchronous 1 N component and a relatively small ? frequency component. The response with the 8 -bolt coupling had a 0. 4 N component that was larger than the 1 N component. A 5 -tilting pad journal bearing was also tested to better understand its behavior under misalignment because some experts attribute the 2 N response to the nonlinear forces produced by bearings with high unit loads.

This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of <b>misalignment,</b> if the <b>coupling</b> is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|R
