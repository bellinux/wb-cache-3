5|$|Allan Ramsay (1713–84) {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> works like that of Queen Charlotte and her Children (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> studies.|$|E

It is a <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> call than the wail and is used {{exclusively}} between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the emotional, embodied and sensuous aspects of intimacy within and between two families from Kulob, southern Tajikistan as it is embedded in imminent or/and impending conflict. It focuses on touch and its importance to the fashioning of family life that is also informed by government policies and Muslim subjectivities. The ethnography highlights bodily sensations such as shaking chills, and visceral episodes such as vomiting, fainting, or sensuously-dreaming because they materialise the narrative, experience and performativity of the qualities of touch. The article advances the notion that touch pertains not only to both physical immediacy and intimate closeness, but also to processes of physical separation and estrangement between two or <b>more</b> <b>intimates...</b>|$|R
60|$|Jimmy, for his part, was cursing the ill fortune {{that had}} brought Lord Wisbeach across his path. He saw clearly that it only needed {{recognition}} by one or two <b>more</b> <b>intimates</b> of Jimmy Crocker to make Ann suspect his real identity. The {{fact that she had}} seen him with Bayliss in Paddington Station and had fallen into the error of supposing Bayliss to be his father had kept her from suspecting until now; but this could not last forever. He remembered Lord Wisbeach well, as a garrulous, irrepressible chatterer who would probably talk about old times to such an extent as to cause Ann to realise the truth in the first five minutes.|$|R

Stefani's recent partnership with MasterCard allowed her to create a concert experience for her fans in a <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> setting, as she did not perform in large concert venues.

5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E

5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E

5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield's life.|$|E
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
5|$|The cantata BWV 39 is in two parts, {{conforming}} {{to the structure}} of the Meiningen series. The first part begins with a long choral movement for four-part chorus and full orchestra. It is followed by a recitative for bass and an aria for alto, with obbligato violin and oboe. The second part begins with the central movement based on the New Testament text, a solo for bass, as vox Christi, accompanied by an obbligato violoncello. It is followed by an aria for soprano with obbligato recorders in unison. The second recitative for alto and strings leads into the concluding four-part chorale in which the choir doubled by the full orchestra. The complex scoring of the monumental opening movement, employing full orchestra and chorus, contrasts with that of the succeeding non-choral movements, which are accompanied by smaller <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> groups of instruments.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E

The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E

40|$|Research {{supports}} {{the conclusion that}} adults show a pattern of restrictive disclosure in which they choose to disclose intimate information to friends rather than nonfriends. From a developmental perspective, however, only limited evidence exists for this restrictive disclosure to friends process in children. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate whether, and if so at what age, children show the restrictive disclosure to friends in their actual communication with peers. Sixteen subjects (8 boys and 8 girls) selected from each of kindergarten, second and fourth grades were asked to "send a message" on a tape recorder to both a peer friend and peer nonfriend and talk about five categories which varied in personal content. The results indicated that the restrictive disclosure to friends pattern was evident in all three grades examined. Subjects disclosed overall, <b>more</b> high <b>intimate</b> but not <b>more</b> low <b>intimate</b> information to friends than to nonfriends. Age differences were also found in which there was an increase with age in the restriction of positive personal information to friends. These findings were discussed in terms of the development of social modesty...|$|R
