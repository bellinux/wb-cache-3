Although there is {{increasing}} recognition {{of the need for}} DMM programs, major obstacles to their development include problems of securing adequate financial support and concerns about the liability risks inherent in providing financial services. This article describes an innovative DMM service model developed at Senior Health and Peer Counseling in Santa Monica, California, that has serviced more than 100 elders during its first two years of operation. The article explores the mission, key components and organization of the service model, including the development of a <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>Technical</b> Advisory <b>Group</b> and a professionally supervised volunteer staff, the service planning and care coordination issues, the risk management protocols, and the need for multiple sources of financial support...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{adverse effects}} of climate change on Ethiopia’s agricultural sector are a major concern, particularly given the country’s dependence on agricultural production. Securing Ethiopia’s economic and social well-being in the face of climate change requires that policymakers and stakeholders work together to integrate climate change adaptation into the country’s development process. Three stakeholder discussion forums held in 2006 in Addis Ababa, Awassa, and Bahir Dar as part of the project, “Food and Water Security under Global Change: Developing Adaptive Capacity with a Focus on Rural Africa,” were attended by representatives of the government, civil society, business sector, and local communities. The forums elicited information to enable policymakers to make more informed decisions related to climate change adaptation. The forums complemented ongoing efforts to develop the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA), which is overseen by a steering committee representing government, nongovernment, academic, and research institutions. Under NAPA, <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>technical</b> working <b>groups</b> have been formed to assess the country’s vulnerability to the adverse consequences of climate change, gauge current adaptation efforts, and identify ways in which public agencies could assist in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change. In addition, two national and eight regional workshops were conducted involving nearly 500 participants with various areas of expertise. Like the stakeholder forums, the workshops solicited information to create greater awareness of climate change, assess the extent of the area’s vulnerability, and help identify adaptation options. This brief is based on a paper that presents findings from the stakeholder discussion forums, as well as NAPA’s <b>technical</b> working <b>groups</b> and workshops. These meetings explored stakeholders’ perceptions of vulnerability to climate change and considered ways in which adaptation measures could be further integrated into Ethiopia’s development process.
