40|$|James Wintle's, Northwest <b>Miniatures</b> for flute, <b>trumpet</b> {{and piano}} {{is a unique}} work in the chamber music repertoire. In addition, the use of {{auxiliary}} instruments makes this piece a rarity in the flute and trumpet chamber music repertoire. There are {{a limited number of}} resources presently available to performers regarding Northwest Miniatures. This dissertation provides a pedagogical performance guide addressing the inherent challenges for the flutist and this instrumentation and serves as a new resource for performers and scholars of this work. It provides a performance analysis of the piece along with pertinent pedagogical information and exercises to assist the flutist. Insight from the composer on how to address these challenges is also included. Because there are a limited number of scholarly resources available on the subject of flute and trumpet chamber music, this dissertation is a significant contribution to this genre of repertoire...|$|R
