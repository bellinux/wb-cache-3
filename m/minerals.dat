5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate <b>minerals</b> also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in <b>minerals</b> because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide <b>minerals</b> contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate <b>minerals</b> contain boron in oxidation state +3. These <b>minerals</b> resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron <b>minerals</b> never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the <b>minerals,</b> such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E

5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), <b>minerals</b> (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole <b>minerals</b> which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator <b>minerals</b> typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These <b>minerals</b> are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the <b>minerals.</b> The most common indicator <b>minerals</b> are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting <b>minerals</b> in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from <b>minerals,</b> and the Crystal ability generates <b>minerals</b> from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use <b>minerals</b> offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The {{old adage}} 'mineral {{exploration}} is like finding {{a needle in}} a haystack' recaps the difficulty of finding economic <b>mineral</b> deposits near or beneath the surface. In general, two main approaches can be used to detect the presence of <b>mineral</b> deposits near or beneath the ground surface. One employs a <b>mineral</b> deposit model and the other aims at the identification of a primary halo about a <b>mineral</b> deposit. A <b>mineral</b> deposit model provides systematic empirical (descriptive) and/or theoretical (genetic) descriptions of the essential geological, geochemical and geophysical features of a type of <b>mineral</b> deposits (cf. Cox and Singer, 1986 and Roberts et al., 1988). The primary halo of a <b>mineral</b> deposit, as defined originally by Safronov (1936), is ‘an area including rock, surrounding <b>mineral</b> deposit (ore bodies) and enriched elements that make up that deposit’. Thus, descriptions of primary haloes may form part of a <b>mineral</b> deposit model, but both deposit model and primary halo approaches to <b>mineral</b> exploration are based on studies of primary geochemical characteristics of <b>mineral</b> deposits because chemical processes during mineralization are the ones that ultimately bring about metal precipitation or <b>mineral</b> formation. However, a deposit model approach to <b>mineral</b> exploration is apt for identifying 'which haystacks contain a needle' whereas a primary halo approach to <b>mineral</b> exploration is proper for deducing 'where in a needle-bearing haystack is the needle located'...|$|R
