40|$|<b>My</b> <b>topic</b> {{today is}} {{redundancy}} {{of a certain}} sort-eonstitutional redundancy. You will perhaps have noticed that <b>my</b> <b>topic</b> sentence itself arguably involved a kind of redundancy-the word 2 ̆ 2 redundancy 2 ̆ 2 appeared twice. Does this make it a bad topic sentence? I hope not. Rather, I hope the end of <b>my</b> <b>topic</b> sentence helped clarify {{the beginning of the}} sentence by making express what might otherwise only have been implied. Since I am not a linguist but a constitutional scholar, when I said <b>my</b> <b>topic</b> today is redundancy of a certain sort, most of you probably inferred that I meant to address constitutional redundancy. Rather than leaving this to inference, however, I thought it best to be explicit. But suppose I had said instead that 2 ̆ 2 <b>my</b> <b>topic</b> today is constitutional redundancy, which is <b>my</b> <b>topic</b> today. 2 ̆ 2 Would that have been a bad topic sentence?
