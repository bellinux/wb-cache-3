Spanning almost four decades of scholarship, the volume reflects the breadth of Babe 2 ̆ 7 s work, from media and economics to communications history and political economy.

50|$|Within a {{combustion}} chamber containing porous <b>media,</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the environment}} can be assumed as follows. A preheating region exists prior {{to the surface of}} the flame front denoted by δp. Preheating length is marked by the beginning of the porous solid where appreciable heat transfer to the gas phase occurs and ends when the solid and gas phase reach equilibrium temperature. The region of chemical heat release, the flame, whose thickness can be given as δL, exists following the preheat region and its length is dependent upon mass flux, surface properties, and equivalence ratio. Beyond the flame, where minimal chemical heat release occurs, heat is convectively transferred from the post combustion gasses into the solid. Heat then conducts and radiates through the solid structure upstream through the flame. Within the preheating region, heat is again convectively transferred from the solid structure to the gas.|$|E
5000|$|Esser {{shows in}} his work which factors {{influence}} journalistic intervention in the broadcasting of election campaigns (in different national contexts). In professional journalism, the <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> {{as well as the}} political structure have influence on the extent of journalistic interventionism. According to this model, interventionism occurs in a political culture in which public opinion is distrustful of political institutions. Generally, interventionism most likely occurs when the media has achieved a high status of independence, especially from political control. As a result, the sound bites of politicians in an interventionist report tend to be rather short whereas those from the journalists tend to be longer. High interventionism in an election campaign also leads to “a smaller amount of election news coverage in general”. In an interventionist reporting style, journalism becomes more focused on journalists instead on the politicians or the subject they report about, and thus journalists “increase their influence, authority, and ”. Thus, media interventionism is high when journalists convey the content of election campaigns in their own words. Jesper Strömbäck, professor of Media and Communication at the Mid Sweden University and Daniela V. Dimitrova, assistant professor at the Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication at the Iowa State University, developed indicators with which the degree of journalistic interventionism can be measured in, for instance, election campaigns. They found the following indicators relevant: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} toward greater openness represents {{a change of}} philosophy, ethos, and government {{and a set of}} interrelated and complex changes that transform markets altering the modes of production and consumption, ushering in a new era based on the values of openness: an ethic of sharing and peer-to-peer collaboration enabled through new architectures of participation. These changes indicate a broader shift from the underlying industrial mode of production, productionis metaphysics to a postindustrial mode of consumption as use, reuse, and modification where new logics of social <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> different patterns of cultural consumption and symbolic analysis becomes a habitual and daily creative activity. The economics of openness constructs a new language of presuming and produsage in order to capture the open participation, collective co-creativity, communal evaluation, and commons-based production of social and public goods. Information is the vital element in the „new‰ˇ politics and economy that links space, knowledge, and capital in networked practices and freedom is the essential ingredient in this equation if these network practices are to develop or transform themselves into 'knowledge cultures'. The Virtues of Openness investigates the social processes and policies that foster openness as an overriding educational value evidenced in the growth of open source, open access, and open education and their convergences that characterize global knowledge communities. The book argues that openness seems also to suggest political transparency and the norms of open inquiry, indeed, even democracy itself as both the basis of the logic of inquiry and the dissemination of its results.|$|E

50|$|In {{his study}} Still the Middle Way: A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns (2006) Lars W. Nord {{examines}} {{the change in}} Sweden {{in the light of}} hybridization. He discovers a mixed picture where media are becoming more important both as an arena and an actor in the political communication process. “The transformation process in Sweden is, however, rather slow and does not correspond in any way to the dramatic changes taking place within the electorate and the media system”. Nord names several reasons for Sweden’s particular hybridization: First, he indicates that the political and electoral context in Sweden, which means a proportional and party-based electoral system, compromises “a possible global diffusion of campaign and marketing techniques based upon a two-party system and candidate centered”. Second the Swedish <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> is still politics-friendly and much time and space during election time is spend on more substantial political coverage than on power plays or scandals. As a last reason Nord names the political culture of Sweden where “political parties still thrive on party platforms and manifestos in their campaign activities, while they officially play down political marketing practices” because most of the members and voters expect that. In his conclusion Nord characterizes the hybridization of political communication practices in Sweden by a growing use of marketing tools, although he admits that substantial obstacles to the complete implementation of modern practices still exist. Therefore he identifies existing laws and regulations and, even more, public perceptions of parties, politics, and elections. Nord’s study shows a particular insight how hybridization can look like in a Western European country.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be {{used for}} 3 D {{analysis}} of small-scale porous <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> and internal flow-related processes. It offers notable advantages over traditional sediment sampling (e. g. cores or surface-based scanning) as it is capable of high spatio-temporal resolution of the full 3 D volume, including the sub-surface. Similarly, compared to X-Ray tomography, the extensive catalogue of MR pulse sequences typically provides: faster capture for imaging dynamic fluid processes; greater flexibility in resolving chemical species or tracers; and a safer radiation-free methodology. To demonstrate the relevance of this technique in geomorphological research, three exemplar applications are described: porous <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> of gravel bed rivers; measurements of fluid processes within aquifer pores and fractures; and, concentration mapping of contaminants through sand/gravel frameworks.

This article adopts experimental method to research the supercritical CO 2 and water flow in porous media, using MRI as visualization and measurement method. Supercritical CO 2 and water are injected into the sintered glass porous <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> by different mixture ratios. The sintered glass porous <b>media</b> <b>structure</b> is designed with the fissure defect. Visualization and analysis results simultaneously demonstrate that supercritical CO 2 saturation and distribution vary with different ratios. The CO 2 saturation increases with elevation in CO 2 -water ratio. And the CO 2 distribution is significantly influenced by the buoyancy force and the supercritical CO 2 will tend to migrate {{to the top of}} the test section. This paper also investigates the fissure effect. More supercritical CO 2 will migrate to the top when encounters the fissure defect, and therefore the cap rock has to withstand bigger pressure, which will reduce the safety of carbon geological storage...|$|E
