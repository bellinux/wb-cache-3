5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna. He also finds out that his brother, Paul, has been named acting captain, but he doesn't seem to be coping well with his new responsibilities. Mayweather offers to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury {{returned}} to the theatre. Although cast in the lead role in the 2001 Kander and Ebb musical The Visit, she withdrew before it opened due to her husband's deteriorating health. Peter died in January 2003 {{of congestive heart failure}} at the couple's Brentwood, California home. Lansbury felt that after this event she would not take on any more major acting roles, and that instead might <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cameo appearances but nothing more. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan, and in a 2014 interview noted that she also had homes in Ireland and Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E

25|$|Those who reload {{with the}} primary goal of maximizing {{accuracy}} or terminal performance may end up paying more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this is especially true for military calibers which are commonly available as surplus.

25|$|In 2000, Burgundy had a {{total of}} 3 200 wine {{domaines}} (compared to 50 in the early 19th century), of which 520 were {{in the department of}} Yonne, 1 100 in Côte-d'Or and 1 570 in Saône-et-Loir. Generally, the small growers sell their grapes to larger producers, merchants called négociants, who blend and bottle the wine. The roughly 115 négociants who produce the majority of the wine only control around 8% of the area. Individual growers have around 67% of the area, but produce and market only around 25% of the wine. Some small wineries produce only 100-200 cases/year, while many producers <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand cases/year.|$|E
25|$|Full VTOL {{testing at}} Edwards AFB was delayed pending the {{availability}} of the 7,100 shp Allison YT54, which never materialized. After the brief unintentional hop, the aircraft made a total of 32 flights. All further XFV-1 flights did not involve any vertical takeoffs or landings. The XFV-1 was able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> transitions in flight from the conventional to the vertical flight mode and back, and had briefly held in hover at altitude. Performance remained limited by the confines of the flight test regime. With the realization that the XFV's top speeds would be eclipsed by contemporary fighters and that only highly experienced pilots could fly the aircraft, the project was cancelled in June 1955.|$|E

25|$|Quantum physics {{does not}} allow us to access all this {{information}} directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Soccer {{was criticized}} after the {{match for the}} secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. [...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is going to change the profile of the tournament, necessarily. It might <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> people happy, it might <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> people unhappy. But ultimately, I’m not convinced that’s what is going to raise the profile." ...|$|E

500|$|Myers {{once made}} {{balloons}} and {{equipment for the}} experimentation of making artificial rain and gained renown for that beyond any other scientist. The balloons were referred to as [...] "bombs" [...] – rain-producing explosions. The first demonstration experiments, based on theories by Illinois engineer Edward Powers for making rain, were done in May 1891 for General Robert Saint George Dyrenforth (Patent Commissioner) of Washington, D.C. at Myers' Frankfort [...] "balloon farm". Dyrenforth, who represented the United States Department of Agriculture, then had Myers <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> balloon [...] "bombs" [...] for a presentation in [...] Washington, D.C.

500|$|Six {{months passed}} as Rogers {{worked on a}} social game before he chose to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more changes: more enemy types and progression, {{graphics}} in the background, and so emailed people to continue development. Rogers described his own critical list of video games as having minimalist aesthetics with no overt story to tell other than through its game mechanics, and wanted the game {{to live up to}} those expectations. He fine-tuned the game with gut-driven decisions. For example, he applied a concept he called [...] "sticky friction" [...] from Super Mario Bros. 3 to the game's controls. One of the final features was the [...] "scream sound effect" [...] Rogers made with his guitar and [...] "crushed" [...] for a distorted and quasi-digital sound that he compared to those made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta {{thought of}} the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script {{together}} with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, [...] "Duffless", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> changes. Their script became the eleventh season episode [...] "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had [...] "a vested interest in getting Barney sober." [...] However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, [...] "He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins." ...|$|E
