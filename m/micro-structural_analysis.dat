For example, the well-preserved cuticle of cordaitales fossils, an extinct order of plant, found in Sydney, Stellarton and Bay St. George shows similar FTIR spectra.

Samples from the failed reformer furnace tube were cut and prepared for metallographic examination. Examination with electron microscope was carried out with secondary and backscattered electron detectors; x-ray analysis was conducted at the grain boundary areas. In tubes, which are filled with a supported nickel catalyst, methane reacts with steam, carbondioxide and oxygen into synthesis gas.

The catalyst deactivation caused by feeding is heavier than that designed hydrocarbon. Using an unsuitably designed hydrocarbon causes a thin layer of carbon coating on the catalyst surface.

40|$|This study {{examined}} judges’ constructions of the ‘best {{interests of the}} child’ in child custody and access arraignments where there were allegations of domestic violence {{within the context of}} an interview. Using interviews with six Irish District Court judges, a <b>micro-structural</b> discourse <b>analysis</b> enabled the identification of socio-cultural discourses, scientific knowledge and judges’ own values and beliefs biases about custody arraignments in cases of domestic violence. Judges’ discourses were shaped by an idealisation of the nuclear family unit which resulted in a pro-access philosophy (Theme 1). The knowledge that domestic violence had occurred challenged this ideology and, to rhetorically manage this dilemma, judges’ talk normalised or trivialised abusive parents’ behaviour, which rendered domestic violence irrelevant to child custody and access (Theme 2). Mothers who alleged domestic violence when they disputed contact between fathers and their children were pathologised through talk (Theme 3).

40|$|Effective {{image-based}} {{correction of}} motion and other acquisition artifacts became an essential step in diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) <b>analysis</b> as the <b>micro-structural</b> tissue <b>analysis</b> advances towards higher-order models. These come with increasing {{demands on the}} number of acquired images and the diffusion strength (b-value) yielding lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and a higher susceptibility to artifacts. These conditions, however, render the current image-based correction schemes, which act retrospectively on the acquired images through pairwise registration, more and more ineffective. Following the hypothesis, that a more consequent exploitation of the different intensity relationships between the volumes would reduce registration outliers, a novel correction scheme based on memetic search is proposed. This scheme allows for incorporating all single image metrics into a multi-objective optimization approach. To allow a quantitative evaluation of registration precision, realistic synthetic data are constructed by extending a diffusion MRI simulation framework by motion and eddy-currents-caused artifacts. The increased robustness and efficacy of the multi-objective registration method is demonstrated on the synthetic as well as in-vivo datasets at different levels of motion and other acquisition artifacts. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, the average target registration error (TRE) remained below the single voxel size also at high b-values (3000 s. mm- 2) and low signal-to-noise ratio in the moderately artifacted datasets. In the more severely artifacted data, the multi-objective method was able to eliminate most of the registration outliers of the state-of-the-art methods, yielding an average TRE below the double voxel size. In the in-vivo data, the increased precision manifested itself in the scalar measures as well as the fiber orientation derived from the higher-order Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model. For the neuronal fiber tracts reconstructed on the data after correction, the proposed method most closely resembled the ground-truth. The proposed multi-objective method has not only impact on the evaluation of higher-order diffusion models as well as fiber tractography and connectomics, but could also find application to challenging image registration problems in general...|$|R

Vertical and lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurements of the films conclusively demonstrate that BTF 7 C 3 O and BTF 7 M 3 O thin films are piezoelectric and ferroelectric at room temperature, with the major polarization vector in the lateral plane of the films. No net magnetization was observed for the in-plane superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry measurements of BTF 7 M 3 O thin films. In contrast, SQUID measurements of the BTF 7 C 3 O films clearly demonstrated ferromagnetic behavior, with a remanent magnetization, B r, of 6. 37 emu/cm 3 (or 804 memu/g), remanent moment 4. 99 × 10 - 5 emu. The BTF 7 C 3 O films were scrutinized by x-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray analysis mapping to assess the prospect of the observed multiferroic properties being intrinsic to the main phase. The results of extensive <b>micro-structural</b> phase <b>analysis</b> demonstrated that the BTF 7 C 3 O films comprised of a 3. 95 Fe/Co-rich spinel phase, likely CoFe 2 - xTi xO 4, which would account for the observed magnetic moment in the films. Additionally, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission electron microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) imaging confirmed that the majority of magnetic response arises from the Fe sites of Fe/Co-rich spinel phase inclusions. While the magnetic contribution from the main phase could not be determined by the XMCD-PEEM images, these data however imply that the Bi 5 Ti 3 Fe 0. 7 Co 0. 3 O 15 thin films are likely not single phase multiferroics at room temperature.

The results of these newly developed, highly accurate automated quantitative analysis techniques to forensically compare micro-structural variations between hardened concrete core samples are presented. Quantitative <b>micro-structural</b> digital <b>analysis</b> of large image data files (> 3 GB), have only recently been able to be studied outside the proprietary concrete laboratories {{with the release of}} 64 -bit Image J, 64 -bit Windows 7 operating system and 64 -bit Office 2010. This thesis will demonstrate that only three simple procedures need to be followed to attain accurate quantitative digital analysis of large hardened concrete micro-structures: 1. The samples must be prepared by slow and careful fine diamond lapping with surface cooling to prevent any underlying damage to concrete micro-structure from overheating, thus preventing pull-outs of fine aggregate and sand particles within the fine cement paste matrix. This also ensures that accurately sized sharp pore perimeters remain and very fine air voids and hairline shrinkage micro-cracks are revealed. 2. The digital image needs to be obtained by a highly accurate white cold cathode fluorescent lamp IR LED light sourced digital scanner, such as a flat bed Epson Perfection V 700 Photo scanner with true optical resolution of at least 6400 ppi x 6400 ppi (~ 4 &# 956; 2). It will be preferable in the near future to use a much higher resolution, as for example 50800 ppi x 50800 ppi (0. 5 &# 956; 2), comparable to the best current proprietary photo scanners and saved in uncompressed TIFF file in 128 -bit software, as soon as 128 -bit Windows 8 becomes available. 3. All digital image files must not be altered or enhanced in any way. Any enhancement of the digital image file changes forever its ability to be used for accurate quantitative digital analysis. All image analysis software calculations thereafter can only be then roughly qualitative.

40|$|Aim: This {{is one of}} our mineralogical study series {{aimed at}} the {{preliminary}} characterization of iron ore and its neighboring farmland soils, with focus on ore impact on soil quality, toxic metals concentration and the geo-accumulation status of pollutants. Methodology: Mineral (Iron ore) samples and ore rich soils from neighboring farmlands, coded as I-Soil, I-soil-FLA, I-soil-FLB and I-soil-FLC were collected from Itakpe, Kogi State in North Central Nigeria. Samples were qualitatively characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Ultraviolet Visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer for functional group <b>analysis,</b> <b>micro-structural</b> morphology and spectral profile respectively. Physico-chemical parameters were investigated following routine classical (wet) chemistry procedures. Levels of toxic metals including Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Manganese (Mn), Cadmium(Cd), Chromium (Cr), Zinc (Zn), Nickel (Ni) and Copper(Cu) in both ores and soils were estimated using Atomic Adsorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Results: The iron ore SEM images appeared compact with irregular shapes. UV –Visible Spectral shows that the mineral has possibly leached from the parent ore to the nearby soils at similar range. Highlights of this studies shows that the level of metals in farmland soils are statistically significant (p 0. 05) when compared to acceptable or threshold limits provided by the USEPA and WHO. Relying on geo-accumulation index values, this study classified the farmland soil with regards to the iron load as “extremely contaminated”. Investigated soil samples are “strongly contaminated” with Pb, “moderately contaminated” with Mn and Zn and “uncontaminated” with Cd and Cu. Conclusion: The parametric factors of the soil samples, soil quality and metal distribution among ore-rich soils showed levels that could be linked to both geogenic and anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, the farmland soil’s toxic metal levels in the study area might be enriched by either mine tailing from the mineral ore depot or anthropogenic.

40|$|This study explores and {{describes}} the interface properties of various high-k materials deposited on the Ge substrate. Deposition/ growth of these material films {{has been achieved}} using multiple techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), molecular beam epitaxy and thermal growth. High dielectrics (k) materials based on metal (4 d and 5 d) such as Y 2 O 3, ZrO 2, HfO 2, Ta 2 O 5, and from the lanthanide series, La 2 O 3 and Tm 2 O 3 were deposited on germanium and characterized to find out interface quality and band offset between Ge substrate and the oxides. Additionally, Al 2 O 3 was considered, both as an interface barrier layer and as a high –k layer. Material and interface characterization was done using atomic force microscopy (AFM), capacitance-voltage (C-V), current-voltage (I-V), Variable Angle Spectral Ellipsometry (VASE), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) including the post growth <b>micro-structural</b> and compositional <b>analysis</b> using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Various physical and electrical studies were performed based on the above mentioned characterization techniques. The high-k material / Ge interface has been studied systematically using XPS and VASE characterization, considering the effects of temperature and thickness during deposition. Two germanium interface engineering methods were developed and discussed: (i) germanate formation using La 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3, and (ii) using Al 2 O 3 and Tm 2 O 3 as barrier layers, and S passivation for Ta 2 O 5 films. Based on the physical and electrical characterization carried out in this work, Ge interface engineering using rare-earth material inclusion {{happens to be a}} promising route to fabricate Ge CMOS devices with high performance. This statement is supported by the fact that these high-k materials provide a defect free interface and reduce the possibility of unstable GeOx formation at the interface, hence improving the interface quality. Post deposition annealing effects on Tm 2 O 3 has been analysed using XPS and VUV-VASE. The stack prepared for the purpose was of EOT (equivalent oxide thickness) ~ 5 nm Tm 2 O 3 /epi-Ge/Si. Study with Tm 2 O 3 presented 3 main findings, i) Valence band offset estimation using Kraut’s method was consistent within the experimental error, and found to be 3. 05 ± 0. 2 eV, ii) the VBO for thermal GeO 2 /Ge stack was found to be matching with the recently reported value by Toriumi’s group. The value of conduction band offset was estimated to be higher than 1 eV, indicating the favorability of GeO 2 as a passivation layer for Ge, iii) the reactivity of Tm 2 O 3 on Ge was found to be even lower than that of Si, indicating the possibility of a desirable interface. This thesis further explores the use of hafnia and alumina with Sulphur (S) passivated and un-passivated Ge samples. For this purpose HfO 2 /Ge and Al 2 O 3 /Ge stacks were prepared using ALD technique. It was observed that using H 2 O with O plasma, reduces the purge time and gives low carbon incorporation from metals. Hence O plasma and H 2 O were used as oxidizing agents and the interface properties were studied systematically, which is a new contribution by this work. Further the effects of adding TiO 2 contents to HfO 2 layer on interface properties were studied, using Al 2 O 3 (0. 3 nm) as surface passivation. In this work the achieved EOT of HfO 2 with the controlled introduction of TiO 2 was ~ 1. 3 nm, giving a leakage current as low as 10 - 7 A/cm- 2 at ± 1 V, which is in the acceptable limits. Finally, Ta 2 O 5 films were characterized on Ge for band line up with respect to Ge. The deposition of the films was done by ALD technique at 250 °C. The analysis was done on both S passivated and un-passivated samples. The band line up parameters were estimated using XPS and it was observed that the valence band offset for S passivated sample was 2. 67 eV whereas it was 2. 84 eV for un-passivated Ge sample. Ta 2 O 5 reflected a band gap of 4. 44 eV (estimated from the energy loss spectrum of O 1 s core level) for a 20 nm thick film deposited by ALD. Hence this thesis will cover the high-k materials and their application as a gate oxide and also the passivation layer for Ge substrates for Ge CMOS devices...|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} fusion approach using wavelet filters is used {{to detect}} edges with low contrast {{in the presence of}} noise. Gabor wavelet edge filters are used at two scales and these are combined using algorithm fusion to locate edges of various sizes (scales) under varying contrast and noise conditions. This novel algorithm fusion approach is tested on different microscopy images of several materials and shown to be robust to these changing imaging conditions. A real-time skeletonization approach is also discussed that applies a new and efficient hit and miss transform (HMT) to produce lines of one pixel width. Keywords: Algorithm (edge) fusion, Gabor wavelets, line detection, microscopy, <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis,</b> morphology, modified hit and miss algorithm, multi-scale edge enhancement, skeletonization. 1 Introduction: Problem Definition Microscopy imaging analysis of pure metals and alloys is commonly used in material science for studying intergranular fracture, stress corrosion, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{growth is}} a {{frequent}} cause of expansive deformations in natural soils, compacted soils, rocks and concrete. The sulphate crystallization in discontinuities and cracks due to evaporation of highly mineralized solutions can contribute in an important way to displacements and swelling pressures that usually appear in tunnels and deep foundations in argillaceous rocks. The present work is aimed to study the basic mechanisms that control the hydrated sulphate mineral growth in anhydritic-gypsiferous argillaceous rocks due to the evaporation of groundwater. The paper presents some laboratory works including mineralogical and <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{as well as the}} design and development of new free swelling tests which were developed focusing on the capacity to discern the role carried out by the geochemical properties of the water, the main environmental variables and the degree of cracking on undisturbed sulphate argillaceous samples from different zones of the Lower Ebro Basin (Catalonia, Spain).

40|$|Current {{musculoskeletal}} {{imaging techniques}} usually target the macro-morphology of articular cartilage or use histological analysis. These techniques {{are able to}} reveal advanced osteoarthritic changes in articular cartilage but fail to give detailed information to distinguish early osteoarthritis from healthy cartilage, and this necessitates high-resolution imaging techniques measuring cells and the extracellular matrix within the multilayer structure of articular cartilage. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the cellular components and extracellular matrix of articular cartilage as well as high-resolution imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance image, electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, second harmonic generation microscopy, and laser scanning confocal arthroscopy, in the measurement of multilayer ultra-structures of articular cartilage. This review also provides an overview for <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{the main components of}} normal or osteoarthritic cartilage and discusses the potential and challenges associated with developing non-invasive high-resolution imaging techniques for both research and clinical diagnosis of early to late osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) {{are able to}} produce {{electricity}} and heat from hydrogen- or carbon-containing fuels with high efficiencies and are considered important cornerstones for future sustainable energy systems. Performance, activation and degradation processes are crucial parameters to control before the technology can achieve breakthrough. They have been widely studied, predominately by electrochemical testing with subsequent <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis.</b> In {{order to be able}} to develop better SOFCs, it is important to understand how the measured electrochemical performance depends on materials and structural properties, preferably at the atomic level. A characterization of these properties under operation is desired. As SOFCs operate at temperatures around 1073  K, this is a challenge. A spectroelectrochemical cell was designed that is able to study SOFCs at operating temperatures and in the presence of relevant gases. Simultaneous spectroscopic and electrochemical evaluation by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is possible...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear energy, an {{essential}} part of the energy mix, requires an optimal fuel cycle. The fuel materials are studied for their properties and their production, recycling and disposition processes. The first Symposium on The Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European Material Research Society (EMRS) was held at the EMRS 13 Spring Meeting Strasbourg May 27 e 31, 2013. Symposium E dealt with fuel production, post-irradiation examination, partitioning and recycling, as well as with waste form materials and involved 105 experts from 17 countries. Symposium E included sessions dealing with materials ranging from ores and minerals, concentrates, fresh and irradiated fuels, and, with waste form materials. Macro-properties such as thermo-dynamical, thermo-physical and mechanical as well as <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis</b> of these fuel materials are discussed for example comparing properties prior and after irradiation. In addition, all process including production, irradiation, reprocessing, recycling and conditioning are treated in an analytical way. JRC. E. 2 -Safety of Irradiated Nuclear Material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this research program is to study the effect of using crushed clay brick as an alternative aggregate in aerated concrete. Two series of mixtures were designed to investigate the physico-mechanical properties and <b>micro-structural</b> <b>analysis</b> of autoclave aerated concrete and foamed concrete, respectively. In each series, natural sand was replaced with crushed clay brick aggregate. In both series results showed {{a significant reduction in}} unit weight, thermal conductivity and sound attenuation coefficient while porosity has increased. Improvement on compressive strength of autoclave aerated concrete was observed at a percentage of 25 % and 50 % replacement, while in foamed concrete compressive strength gradually decreased by increasing crushed clay brick aggregate content. A comparatively uniform distribution of pore in case of foamed concrete with natural sand was observed by scanning electron microscope, while the pores were connected mostly and irregularly for mixes containing a percentage higher than 25 % clay brick aggregate...|$|E
