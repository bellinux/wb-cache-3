Reviews case law concerning the recognition of foreign marriages per se, international private law's treatment of polygamous marriages and possible public policy arguments against same sex marriages. Explains {{the ways in which}} Scottish courts may give legal recognition to their consequences, including: (1) by acknowledging that they deny the parties the capacity to marry again for the duration of their subsistence, under the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 s. 5 (4); (2) by accepting the parties' entitlement to statutory protection in areas such as intestate succession or adoption; and (3) by the granting of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>relief</b> including divorce...|$|E
40|$|English matrimonial law {{until the}} mid-nineteenth century was {{administered}} by the ecclesiastical courts. The high legal fees charged by these courts restricted the number of matrimonial disputes which came before them. Moreover they were not empowered to grant divorce a vinculo. This <b>matrimonial</b> <b>relief</b> could be obtained only from Parliament but few husbands could meet the heavy expenses of a Private Act. The transfer of divorce hearings to a civil court in 1857 benefitted the middle class, though {{the mass of the}} people still remained debarred by inability to pay legal and court fees. Wives were additionally handicapped by economic and legal disadvantages. The need to provide working class wives with a quick, cheap and accessible means of protection from cruel husbands led to the establishment of the matrimonial jurisdiction of magistrates' courts in 1878. Study of the resort to divorce before the Second World War shows that it was the de facto non-availability of divorce rather than the lack of acceptable grounds that resulted in the great majority of broken marriages being dealt with in the summary court. Concern over evidence that the inability of working class spouses to obtain divorce resulted in the formation of illicit unions, {{led to the development of}} legal aid provisions culminating in the Legal Aid and Advice Act of 1949. This Act has been of special benefit to wives seeking divorce. Legal Aid, higher real wages and greater acceptance of divorce within the community have allowed an increasing number of broken working class marriages to be dissolved. Findings from a sample of 1961 divorce petitions show that social class and the rate of divorce are inversely associated. However, a broad breakdown into a non-manual/manual dichotomy hides variations within individual class groupings. Thus, white-collar workers have a higher rate of divorce than do manual workers. The social class of petitioners was also found to be associated with such demographic characteristics such as age at marriage and divorce. Although the divorce courts have been opened to all sections of the population, the criminal courts continue to hear the matrimonial disputes of the very poor. Evidence from a survey of maintenance orders held in magistrates' courts in 1966 suggests that some 165, 000 marriages are neither martially united nor legally dissolved. Half of these separated spouses never seek divorce. <p...|$|E
50|$|The Jewish {{religious}} courts, {{known as}} Rabbinic Courts, whose dayanim ("judges") are selected {{by a committee}} headed by the Minister of Justice, have jurisdiction regarding marital issues of Jews (especially divorce). Divorce of a Jewish couple can only be obtained at the Rabbinical Batei Din. However, if a petition for ancillary <b>matrimonial</b> <b>reliefs,</b> such as custody, support or equitable distribution of property is filed with the Civil Courts before a case for divorce is opened at the Batei Din, then all other marital issues may also be taken by Magistrate Courts sitting as Family Courts. Otherwise, if one spouse opens {{some sort of an}} action with the Batei Din, (including asking the couple for reconciliation), the Batei Din assume that all ancillary relief is aggregated into the main complaint, and the spouses may find themselves facing judicial determination pursuant to Halakha (Jewish religious law), and not pursuant to the secular law. Thus, spouses may lose the equal protection and anti gender discrimination protections of the secular civil law.|$|R
