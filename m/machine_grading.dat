The basic idea of this paper is to use experimental data only for the determination of statistical parameters - mean vector and variance - covariance matrix - and afterwards use these statistical parameters in numerical simulation of <b>machine</b> <b>grading.</b> This numerical procedure gave some valuable data on the average values and the variability of grading results which now make it easier to decide what sample size should be used in determining machine settings...|$|E

30|$|The use of glued {{laminated}} timber products in Japanese post and beam housing has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade. This leads to a growing market for wood lamina which is a prior product for manufacturing {{glued laminated}} posts and beams in Japan. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) for glued laminated timber and structural glued laminated timber are dictated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Notification 1152 [1] and MAFF Notification 235 [2] respectively. This notification provides visual and <b>machine</b> <b>grading</b> requirements for various wood species of lamina. Manufacturers of the glued laminated timber {{have the option of}} visually or machine graded lamina on which the strength grades of glued laminated timber are based. The choice of the grading methods will often depend on the yields that can be achieved in visual grades as compared to the machine grades [3]. If the actual structural properties of the lamina in a particular species are higher than those visually graded, then there are technical and material benefits to be achieved by <b>machine</b> <b>grading</b> the laminae.|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{non-destructive}} methods of grading timber: visual and <b>machine</b> <b>grading.</b> The properties of timber as a natural material depend on the wood species, growth conditions, time of wood-cutting, storing, and the way of treating.

40|$|Structural designs {{codes and}} {{standards}} {{are based on a}} reliable knowledge of the mechanical properties of materials. Alongside seasoning and preservation, grading plays a fundamental role in the production of reliable, natural structural products such as timber. Unfortunately, grading of bamboo is not implemented in a standardised or systematic manner, if at all. This may partly explain why bamboo, despite its many sustainable attributes, remains a marginal material in engineered structures. Currently, in partnership with the International Standards Organisation (ISO) Coventry University and the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) are drafting a grading standard. This INBAR Working Paper presents research into potential grading methodologies for one species of bamboo – Guadua angustifolia Kunth – and recommends criteria for both visual grading and <b>machine</b> <b>grading.</b> For visual grading, the diameter of bamboo culms is deemed to be an important consideration when grading for flexural capacity – a 10 percent increase in external diameter results in a 24 percent increase in flexural capacity. Wall thickness is considered to be critical to shear and tension perpendicular capacities. For <b>machine</b> <b>grading,</b> three main properties were found to be significant: flexural stiffness – important for the design of beams, slender struts and portal frames; linear mass – to help infer density, which is closely correlated to strength properties; and external diameter – which correlated well with flexural capacity and stiffness. It is important to note, that measuring any of these properties can be undertaken in a quick, simple, cost-effective and non-destructive manner. The paper suggests that additional properties that may be critical to design or other applications should be further researched – sheer strength or tensile strength perpendicular to fibres, for instance, which are important to the process of connection design. Implemented effectively, the grading methodologies presented have the potential to enhance the supply of bamboo and deliver positive benefits to producers, contractors, engineers, and consumers...|$|E
30|$|The grade {{yields of}} Hem-Fir (N) (Tsuga heterophylla and Abies amabilis) laminas were {{compared}} for visual and machine grades {{based on the}} Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) for glued laminated timber. The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess technical and material benefits when a glued laminated timber is manufactured using machine-graded laminas rather than visually graded. Total 1000 pieces of Hem-Fir (N) lamina were tested for modulus of elasticity (E) and tensile strength. Also, the E’s measured by two different test equipment (vibration and continuous bending) were compared. The test data showed that if the laminas were machine graded, 54  % of the lamina would achieve a modulus of elasticity of 12.5  GPa or higher, which are above the average 11  GPa assigned to JAS visual Grade 1 of the wood species group D. It was concluded that the <b>machine</b> <b>grading</b> method was able to derive higher mechanical properties leading to a yield benefit for the lamina production.|$|E

LSA induces a high-dimensional semantic space from reading a very large amount of texts.

The word vectors LSA constructs are context free, and each word, irrespective of how many meanings or senses it has, is represented by a single vector. However, when a word is used in different contexts, context appropriate word senses emerge.

At present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading.
