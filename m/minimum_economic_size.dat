40|$|Th Irish Hardy Nursery Stock (HNS) {{industry}} has grown considerably in recent times. For {{the industry to}} maintain this level of growth it must remain competitive, particularly relative to the UK and the Netherlands, Ireland's main trading partners for HNS. Consequently, the objectives of this research were to (i) establish the size and value of the Irish HNS industry in 1999 / 2000, and (ii) examine the relative competitiveness of the Irish HNS industry, using profitability and value as indicators of competitiveness. A census of the Irish HNS industry was carried out between September 2000 and June 2001 to establish the size and value of the industry. The results of the census showed that the net value of plants produced on Irish nurseries amounted to € 30. 6 m in 1999, an increase of € 6. 8 m from € 23. 4 m at the last census in 1996. In the same period the total area devoted to HNS production also increased from 391 ha in 1997 to 465 ha in 1999. Kildare remains the most important county in the industry {{in terms of value}} because of the large area devoted to outdoor containerised production and production under protection. In terms of competitiveness, unpaid labour (imputed) had a significant effect on profitability levels for the three countries. When an imputed charge for unpaid labour was included in the analysis, the UK and Ireland had relatively higher Net Nursery Income (NNI) than the Netherlands. However, when the imputed charge for unpaid labour was excluded from the analysis, Ireland and the Netherlands had relatively higher NNI values than the UK. Firm size and mechanisation levels, were examined as possible sources of inter-firm variations in costs of production and profits. Economies of scale appeared to be evident as nursery size increased from `small' to `medium' and dissipated as nursery size increased from `medium' to `large'. This indicated that the <b>minimum</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> for HNS production appeared to be relatively low. Based on the observed relationship between labour productivity and mechanisation levels, it is possible to infer that future mechanisation of the Irish industry may provide a partial solution to labour availability problems. Although the Irish HNS industry showed a competitive cost advantage, the low added value content of the Irish product is not a reassuring sign for the industry. The research revealed that the competitive potential of the industry in the Netherlands, based on relative value-added properties, was ahead of the Irish and UK industries. However, the Netherlands has not fully succeeded in converting this potential into competitive performance in the Irish market for HNS. The Irish HNS industry remains the largest supplier of HNS to the domestic market, although HNS available from the Netherlands was seen as given better value. In order for the Irish industry to remain competitive in the future the competitive strategies which the industry adopts must be re-evaluated. Distinct market segments were observed in the Irish market, which offers potential for a focused competitive strategy, which may suit smaller specialist producers. The critical buying criteria identified and subsequent relative performance of the Irish industry should provide the information, which is required for a competitive strategy of differentiation.

40|$|Regional {{resource}} {{planning and}} decision-making for industrial forest plantation development increasingly involves participation {{by members of}} the public. Motivation to maximise or minimise the degree to which groups with various interests can satisfy their individual objectives should recognise outcomes arrived at in a consensus decision-making environment. In this study, a planning framework is devised and adopted, which describes a regional planning system prepared in order to assist in the design and evaluation of strategic industrial forest plantation development in Indonesia. The central component of this planning system is interactive Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM) modelling with linkages between optimisation and simulation models. The framework of the whole planning system demonstrates the capability and feasibility of resolving important and conflicting objectives through discussion and communicative decision processes that can be reinforced with modelling sensitivity outputs. In other words, a methodology is developed that allows strategic options for plantation planning to be analysed interactively. The MODM models here are MINMAX and MINSUM goal programming formulations. This model has various features that characterise industrial forest plantation development planning, including physical production, social, economic, environmental, and location aspects. This formulation, moreover, has several advantages such as capturing the essence of the multi-objective decision making problem, encompassing the entire range of feasible tradeoffs among all objectives through parametric programming in order to derive forestland allocations optimally, as well as serving important implementable and practical interests. A <b>minimum</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> (MES) spreadsheet-based model is run to determine profitable plantation sizes by using financial criteria such as IRR and NPV. The MES model outputs are then incorporated within MODM models. A major part of the research reported here was to develop a way of transferring data between simulation and LP models directly through file transfers, and transferring LP derived solutions directly back to the simulation model. This linkage has several advantages: for example, theoretically optimal LP solutions are usually unrealistic in practical or implementational terms because of administrative, social, environmental and other similar problems facing forest management; whereas simulation allows one to explore the effects of deviations from "optimal" LP solutions, and to simulate both in more detail and in broader aggregations of things such as age classes, log types and locations. If measures, e. g. wood and financial flows, are unsatisfactory, some constraints are modified and formed for the relevant LP model utilising, for example, the future log assortment flow consequences and the tradeoffs among them. The automated linkage between optimisation and simulation models provides easy data and solution transfers so that decision makers and stakeholders may gain detailed insights before any consensus decisions need to be made. A geographic information system (GIS) is utilised to enhance pictorially the preferred solutions, information, and appearance. The whole planning system is demonstrated and tested in an indicative case study. The results display the major advantages of consistency, clarity and simplicity of the approach to regional forestland allocation. The framework and results at this stage are only preliminary, because some data are still incomplete and unrefined. This study is, therefore, an initial description and explanation of methodology and an indication of the nature of desirable results rather than a firm policy recommendation pertaining to the case study area. In principle, the framework could also become multi-temporal by creating each variable in a time-dependent fashion. The planning system developed has the ability to incorporate social, financial, environmental, and technical variables in a comprehensive participatory development process. The ultimate value of the quantitative information represented in this framework (or methodology) through a background case study analysis is its ability to facilitate policy formulation to satisfy decision-makers and stakeholders when making informed choices in fundamental management decisions...|$|E

Measurement of economic performance is focused on output/capital ratio, output/labour ratio, and labour/capital ratio. Findings – The results offer evidence for economic diversity in the size compositions and performance variations of dispersed and clustered SSEs; and bigger <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and higher <b>economic</b> performance of clustered than dispersed SSEs. Research limitations/implications – Subject to the comparability of economic structure, the results and implications for India are of relevance for promotion and development of clustered SSEs in other developing countries. Practical implications – From the viewpoint of policy formulation, the results offer a strong empirical basis for a cluster approach rather than a dispersed approach for promotion and development of SSEs in India. The cluster approach has implications for establishing linkages between formal and informal SSEs and for elimination of smallness of dispersed SSEs.

Other profitable activities related to the agricultural holdings include incomes from agricultural products sale, rural tourism, fishery, etc., whether they are performed on or outside the holding. Other profitable activities that are not related to agricultural holdings include activities that do not consume resources of the holding, but only the labor, as like in previous case they may be carried on, or outside the holding. According to gained results, average <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of the holding in the Republic of Serbia is 5. 939 EUR, while the realized economic value on the family agricultural holdings (FAH) is 4. 990 EUR. Census of Agriculture in 2012 showed that the highest average <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of the agricultural holdings has a Vojvodina Region (12. 032 EUR), what is 3, 5 times higher than the value achieved in other regions.
