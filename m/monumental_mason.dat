25|$|Many local {{companies}} and individuals {{contributed to the}} construction of the memorial. These included architect E H Boden, local <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> Zero Ziegler, who donated the marble honour roll and Mr Cunnington, the Bundaberg City Gardens Curator, who supervised the layout and planting of the park.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated {{with his}} training, he took evening classes in stonemasonry at Westminster Technical Institute and in {{calligraphy}} at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where Edward Johnston, {{creator of the}} London Underground typeface, became a strong influence. In 1903 he gave up his architectural training to become a calligrapher, letter-cutter, and <b>monumental</b> <b>mason.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There are a {{great variety}} of monuments within the cemetery, but the vast {{majority}} of them are carved from Sydney sandstone and are the product of a single <b>monumental</b> <b>mason,</b> John Roote Andrews, who had his premises nearby on Prospect Street.|$|E
2500|$|Local <b>monumental</b> <b>mason,</b> Frank Rusconi, {{carved a}} {{miniature}} Baroque Italian palace from 20,948 pieces of marble collected from around New South Wales. [...] The work is 1.2 metres high and, commencing in 1910, took 28 years to complete. [...] It {{can be seen}} in the Gundagai tourist office. [...] Rusconi was also the sculptor of the base of the Dog on the Tuckerbox monument. As bronze was not Rusconi's medium, the rest of the monument was cast at Oliver's Foundry in Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, a 12-ton {{sandstone}} statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart {{was placed}} in the car park of the Wallace Monument near Stirling, Scotland. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> from Brechin, included the word [...] "Braveheart" [...] on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to [...] "desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap". In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue's face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as [...] "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland". In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built {{at the foot of the}} Wallace Monument.|$|E

2500|$|This {{monument}} for Olomouc was {{the culmination}} of work of several artists and master craftsmen, but it did not bring much fortune to them. The first to die during the work was Wenzel Render, a <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> and privileged imperial architect. He came first with the idea to build the column, enforced his will upon the city council, designed it, built the first stage and helped to finance it. His followers Franz Thoneck, Johann Wenzel Rokický and Augustin Scholtz also did not live long enough to see the column finished; it was completed by Johann Ignaz Rokický. The sculptural decoration was started by Phillip Sattler. [...] After his death Andreas Zahner continued and made 18 sculptures and 9 reliefs in 7 years before he died as well. Goldsmith Simon Forstner, who made gilded copper sculptures of the Holy Trinity and of the Assumption of the Virgin, was somewhat luckier and managed to finish his brilliant work. However he lost his health when working on the sculptures and using toxic mercury compounds during the gilding process.|$|E
60|$|And {{he hurried}} away {{to seize the}} {{opportunity}} of introducing that eminent sculptor, Sir Herbert Herne, to the bright young critic who had called him, in the public prints, a <b>monumental</b> <b>mason.</b>|$|E
60|$|And so, satisfied, {{he turned}} round {{to look at}} the bronze Perseus which rose just above him. Benvenuto Cellini's dark hero looked female, with his plump hips and his waist, female and rather insignificant: graceful, and rather vulgar. The clownish Bandinellis were somehow more to the point.--Then all the {{statuary}} in the Loggia! But that is a mistake. It looks too much like the yard of a <b>monumental</b> <b>mason.</b>|$|E
25|$|The firm of Zero Ziegler {{was founded}} in Bundaberg in 1902 as Ziegler and Sons. They {{provided}} many memorials throughout South East Queensland and are still operating as <b>monumental</b> <b>masons.</b>|$|R

50|$|The East Brisbane War Memorial in Mowbray Park is {{significant}} for its aesthetic quality and craftsmanship, the rarity of the Australian Light Horseman statue in a Queensland war memorial, and {{as evidence of}} the work of established <b>monumental</b> <b>masons</b> W Batstone & Sons.|$|R
50|$|The {{cemetery}} contains {{examples of}} a range of key monumental styles dating from the late 19th century until the 1990s.

It {{was designed by}} architects Hockings and Palmer and produced by <b>monumental</b> <b>masons,</b> F M Allen. The granite memorial honours those {{who served in the}} First World War.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the monuments}} display {{a high level}} of {{creative}} achievement and are important for their excellence of design and craftsmanship, and emotive impact. The 1937 Coorey family vault, the 1930s McColdrick family mausoleum, the numerous twin columns distinctive of the work of <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> Walter Bruce and later copied by others, and the [...] tempietto-style Sheedy monument designed by Toowoomba architects Marks and Son and executed by <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> JH Wagner, are outstanding examples of funerary art and architecture.|$|E

50|$|Frank Rusconi (20 August 1874 - 21 May 1964) was, {{together}} with his brother, Joseph, quarry owner and <b>monumental</b> <b>mason</b> of Gundagai, New South Wales, Australia.|$|E
50|$|The place {{remains a}} {{substantially}} intact {{example of a}} 19th Queensland cemetery, containing early headstones, plantings and perimeter fencing. In illustrating its type, the cemetery is {{an important source of}} information about the work of <b>monumental</b> <b>masons</b> and the history of cemetery design and aesthetics in Queensland.|$|R
50|$|Two {{important}} firms of <b>monumental</b> <b>masons</b> {{working in}} Townsville {{made significant contributions}} to the monumental architecture in the West End Cemetery.
