2500|$|Several {{variants}} of the mitrailleuse concept were developed, with common elements {{to all of}} their designs. They were characterized {{by a number of}} rifled barrels clustered together and mounted on a conventional artillery chassis or (in the case of one model) a tripod. The ammunition was secured in a single block and placed into the breech, behind the open ends of the barrels. All of the barrels were loaded simultaneously by a <b>manual</b> <b>closing</b> lever or large horizontal screw. A second lever could be worked rapidly (or in some models, a crank could be turned) to fire each barrel in succession. This earned the weapon its French nickname of moulin à café (coffee grinder). (A very similar name was earned by the hand-cranked, mechanically loaded, continuous-firing, [...] "coffee mill gun" [...] in America during the American Civil War.) ...|$|E

We present an uncommon case of traumatic atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation with an associated type II odontoid fracture in a neurologically intact patient and describe a novel technique {{used for a}} successful closed reduction. Case description: A 20 -year-old female presented with a decreased level of consciousness after being involved in a motor vehicle accident at highway speeds. A computed tomography (CT) demonstrated atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation and a type II odontoid fracture. CT angiography showed a left V 3 vertebral dissection. She was neurologically intact on examination. A halo ring was applied and the patient successfully underwent closed reduction using traction and a novel transoral reduction technique described below. After closed reduction, a C 1 –C 2 posterior instrumented fusion was performed. At 12 -weeks follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, neurologically intact with optimally maintained cervical spine alignment.

Objective: The primary {{objective}} was to report this rare case and discuss the mechanism of dislocation and technique of <b>manual</b> <b>closed</b> reduction of C 1 -C 2 vertebrae in such scenarios. Summary of background data: Posterior atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) is extremely rare and a few cases {{have been reported in}} English literature. This young man sustained a high speed car accident and survived an extreme hyperextension injury to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) without any neurological deficits. On evaluation for neck pain he was noted with a dislocated odontoid lying in front of Atlas. There was C 1 -C 2 facet diastases. No bony injury was noted at CVJ. Transverse axial ligament (TAL) was intact. He underwent a successful awake reduction of the dislocation. The joint had to be manually distracted, realigned, and released under the guidance of fluoroscopy. This was followed by single stage C 1 -C 2 Goel′s fusion with awake prone positioning. This patient was {{able to go back to}} work at the end of 3 months (GOS 5).

40|$|Rice {{agriculture}} {{is a large}} anthropogenic source of atmospheric methane (CH 4). The reliable estimation of CH 4 emissions requires frequent measurements to trace diurnal and seasonal variations. To evaluate the appropriate intervals and optimal time of day to measure CH 4 emissions using the <b>manual</b> <b>closed</b> chamber method, this study analysed four datasets of CH 4 fluxes in a Japanese irrigated rice paddy measured at 2 -hour intervals using the automated closed chamber method. The typical diurnal variation in the CH 4 flux was observed after the rice's heading stage, during which the daily time-weighted mean CH 4 flux was observed twice, in the 08 : 00 11 : 59 and 18 : 00 21 : 59 time windows. During the flooded rice-growing period, the CH 4 emissions, which were estimated by weekly measurements once per day during the 10 : 00 11 : 59 time window, corresponded to 93 106 % of the emissions calculated using the automated measurement method. In contrast, no regular measurement strategies produced a satisfactory estimate of the CH 4 emissions during the non-flooded rice-growing period because of {{a sharp increase in}} the CH 4 flux just after the drainage. Consequently, the combination of weekly measurements once per day at approximately 10 : 00 as local mean time for the flooded rice-growing period and daily measurements once per day during the daytime for 1 week after each drainage event is recommended as a strategy to obtain the estimation with a ± 10 % error...|$|R
