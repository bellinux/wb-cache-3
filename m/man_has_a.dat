5|$|In 1984, {{a tribute}} album titled Every <b>Man</b> <b>Has</b> <b>a</b> Woman was released, {{featuring}} {{a selection of}} Ono songs performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson. It was one of Lennon's projects that he never got to finish. Later that year, Ono and Lennon's final album, Milk and Honey, was released as an unfinished demo. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing of}} Scully collapsing, Mulder {{arrives at the}} {{hospital}} where Scully is being treated. Before {{he is able to}} make contact with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents. Mulder is then brought to Blevins and a senior agent who demands information on why Scully lied about Mulder's death. After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given a good reason to do so.|$|E

John writes [...] "The <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cold," [...] which the teacher marks incorrect, while James writes the correct [...] "The <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cold." [...] Since James' answer was right, it <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> better effect on the teacher.|$|R
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on March 7, 2000. It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E
25|$|For the mid-fifth century we {{have also}} chapter 44 of Jordanes' Getica, which narrates {{the defeat of the}} Suevi king Rechiar {{at the hands of the}} Roman foederati troops {{commanded}} by the Visigoths. It is a vivid, if brief, narration, where Rechiar, a defiant <b>man,</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> purpose, a mood, and emotions, as do the rest of the protagonists.|$|E
25|$|The 12th <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large {{following}} {{all around}} the world. Outside Australia, the UK probably has the most fans with South Africa a very close second. Albums have been learnt by heart by many and Billy Birmingham is often greeted with impressions of his work. There are large groups petitioning for a new album but Birmingham is reluctant as his main star Richie Benaud has announced his retirement (eclipsed by Benaud's death on 10 April 2015), and with newer commentators taking more major roles.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} determinants of the wage is probably the amount of formal education. Women in our sample have on average more formal education than men. For example, 17.9  % of women and 13.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high school degree; 8.7  % of women and 7.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> university degree. However, there are relatively more women who have only compulsory education than men. In particular, 19.1  % of women and 13.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> compulsory schooling only, whereas 28.0  % of women and 48.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> completed <b>an</b> apprenticeship.|$|R
25|$|Liberalism {{first became}} a {{distinct}} political movement during the Age of Enlightenment, {{when it became}} popular among philosophers and economists in the Western world. Liberalism rejected the prevailing social and political norms of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The 17th-century philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct philosophical tradition. Locke argued that each <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> natural right to life, liberty and property, while adding that governments must not violate these rights based on the social contract. Liberals opposed traditional conservatism and sought to replace absolutism in government with representative democracy {{and the rule of}} law.|$|E
25|$|The 12th man or 12th {{player is}} a term for fans of teams in eleven-a-side sports games, {{particularly}} association football (soccer) or American football. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team {{on the playing field}} at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game. Infrequently, the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team. In Canadian football, 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in Australian rules football, 18 players are on the field and the fans are {{often referred to as the}} 19th man. The term has a different meaning in cricket, referring instead to the first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured (the term 6th <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> similar connotation in basketball).|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing {{what they are going to}} do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E

[...] Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the reference to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once. Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries. Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London.|$|E
500|$|Haywood seemed most {{comfortable}} with a philosophy arrived at through the hard-scrabble experiences of the workers. He {{had the ability to}} translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, [...] "If one <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get." [...] While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he liked to say, [...] "I've never read Marx's Capital, but I have the marks of capital all over me." ...|$|E

[...] The couple said that songs like [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] and [...] "Imagine" [...] inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song [...] "Everyman..... Everywoman....."

500|$|In October 1875 Edward {{set off for}} India on an {{extensive}} eight-month tour of the sub-continent. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of {{the treatment of the}} native Indians by the British officials: [...] "Because a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> black face and a different religion from our own, {{there is no reason why}} he should be treated as a brute." [...] Consequently, Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour's success.|$|E

In addition, they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and therefore have to join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it, and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E
