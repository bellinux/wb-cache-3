5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% <b>myristic</b> acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, <b>myristic,</b> oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|Iris {{rhizomes}} {{also contain}} notable amounts of terpenes, and organic acids such as ascorbic acid, <b>myristic</b> acid, tridecylenic acid and undecylenic acid. Iris rhizomes can be toxic. Larger blue flag (I. versicolor) {{and other species}} often grown in gardens and widely hybridized contain elevated amounts of the toxic glycoside iridin. These rhizomes can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or skin irritation, but poisonings are not normally fatal. Irises should only be used medicinally under professional guidance.|$|E
25|$|That {{same study}} {{discussed}} that a diet high in MUFAs {{is not the}} major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most oleic acid in mammalian tissue {{is derived from the}} saturated stearic acid residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the Delta9-desaturase, which also regulates the transformation of the other common saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (<b>myristic</b> and palmitic). The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease.|$|E
500|$|The meat of {{a five-year-old}} {{dromedary}} has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash. The carcass, weighing [...] for a five-year-old dromedary, {{is composed of}} nearly 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat. A seven-to-eight-year-old camel can produce a carcass of [...] The meat is bright red to a dark brown or maroon, while the fat is white. It has the taste and texture of beef. A study of the meat of Iranian dromedaries showed its high glycogen content, which makes it taste sweet like horse meat. The carcasses of well-fed camels {{were found to be}} covered with a thin layer of good quality fat. In a study of the fatty acid composition of raw meat taken from the hind legs of seven one-to-three years old males, 51.5% of the fatty acids were saturated, 29.9% mono-unsaturated, and 18.6% polyunsaturated. The major fatty acids in the meat were palmitic acid (26.0%), oleic acid (18.9%) and linoleic acid (12.1%). In the hump, palmitic acid was dominant (34.4%), followed by oleic acid (28.2%), <b>myristic</b> acid (10.3%) and stearic acid (10%).|$|E

2500|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have indicated that}} serum <b>myristic</b> acid and palmitic acid [...] and dietary <b>myristic</b> and palmitic saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.|$|E
2500|$|It {{should be}} noted, {{as this is}} the {{defining}} factor of saturated fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded {{to each of the}} carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the <b>myristic</b> acid molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).|$|E
2500|$|While {{nutrition}} labels regularly combine them, the saturated {{fatty acids}} appear in different proportions among food groups. [...] Lauric and <b>myristic</b> acids are most commonly found in [...] "tropical" [...] oils (e.g., palm kernel, coconut) and dairy products. [...] The saturated fat in meat, eggs, cacao, and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids.|$|E
2500|$|Warmth: [...] In woollen garments, {{air pockets}} are created between the fibers that reduce {{the rate of}} heat transfer. This {{property}} combined with Lanolin (a hydrophobic grease present in wool fibers) allowing wool to keep you warm when wet. Yak wool is rich in <b>Myristic</b> acid, a type of hydrophobic fatty acid. Independently conducted tests on yak down suggest that it is warmer than Merino wool. Nonetheless, claims vary on how much warmer it is with values ranging between 10-40%.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{membrane}} receptors are denatured or deficient, the signal transduction can be hindered and cause diseases. Some diseases {{are caused by}} disorders of membrane receptor function. [...] This is due to deficiency or degradation of the receptor via changes in the genes that encode and regulate the receptor protein. The membrane receptor TM4SF5 influences the migration of hepatic cells and hepatoma. Also, the cortical NMDA receptor influences membrane fluidity, and is altered in Alzheimer's disease. When the cell is infected by a non-enveloped virus, the virus first binds to specific membrane receptors and then passes itself or a subviral component to the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane. In the case of poliovirus, it is known in vitro that interactions with receptors cause conformational rearrangements which release a virion protein called VP4.The N terminus of VP4 is myristylated and thus hydrophobic【myristic acid=CH3(CH2)12COOH】. It is proposed that the conformational changes induced by receptor binding result in the attachment of <b>myristic</b> acid on VP4 {{and the formation of}} a channel for RNA.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert {{consultation}} {{report concluded}} that [...] "intake of {{saturated fatty acids}} {{is directly related to}} cardiovascular risk. The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in <b>myristic</b> and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI <18.5 kg/m2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements. [...] Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The viral {{particle}} binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human {{and some other}} primate species. For this reason, poliovirus couldn’t be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and <b>myristic</b> acid are released. These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected [...] Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase). Translation by host cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5' G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). The viral lifecycle is very rapid with {{the whole process of}} replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, cell protein synthesis declines to almost zero output – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and [...] in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable, at 4–6 hours the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm. At around 8 hours the cell is effectively dead and lyses to release the {{viral particle}}s.|$|E
