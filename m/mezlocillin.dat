40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{activities}} of <b>mezlocillin</b> and ampicillin, alone and {{in combination with}} gentamicin, against Streptococcus faecalis were compared. In vitro, relative bactericidal and activities for 10 strains of S. faecalis were as follows: <b>mezlocillin</b> plus gentamicin greater than ampicillin plus gentamicin (P is not significant) greater than <b>mezlocillin</b> (P less than 0. 01) greater than ampicillin (P less than 0. 01) greater than gentamicin (P less than 0. 01) greater than control (P less than 0. 01). One of the strains was used to induce endocarditis in rabbits. Infected rabbits were treated by random selection with ampicillin, <b>mezlocillin,</b> ampicillin plus gentamicin, <b>mezlocillin</b> plus gentamicin, or saline (control) for 7 days. Among antibiotic-treated rabbits, survival rates were the same, but ampicillin was less effective than the other regimens in sterilizing both blood cultures (P less than 0. 001 on day 4) and cardiac vegetations (P less than 0. 05 on day 7). Differences in quantitative vegetation cultures among rabbits treated with <b>mezlocillin,</b> <b>mezlocillin</b> plus gentamicin, or ampicillin plus gentamicin and sacrificed on day 7 were not significantly different. Peak inhibitory and bactericidal antibacterial activity titers in serum determined during treatment were higher with <b>mezlocillin</b> (with or without gentamicin) than with ampicillin (with or without gentamicin) (P less than 0. 01). <b>Mezlocillin</b> {{may be more effective}} than ampicillin in the treatment of S. faecalis infections in humans...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-six {{patients}} with female genital tract infections {{were treated with}} intravenous <b>mezlocillin</b> (16 g/day) in a prospective, multicentre, clinical trial. Clindamycin (2 - 4 g/day) was added if patients failed to improve within 48 h of <b>mezlocillin</b> therapy. Cure was noted in 84 - 3 %, improvement in 4 - 8 %, and failure in 7 - 9 %. Using the same basic protocol, but {{with the addition of}} randomization and blinding, <b>mezlocillin</b> and ampicillin (8 g/day) were compared in 48 and 51 postpartum patients, respectively. No significant differences between <b>mezlocillin</b> and ampicillin treated patients were demonstrable. Side-effects were minimal and insignificant.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{isolates}} which synthesised {{the extremely}} common 'TEM- 1 ' plasmid mediated /Mactamase were {{more resistant to}} the a-aminopenicillins, ampicillin, <b>mezlocillin</b> and azlocillin, than were strains which lacked this enzyme. However, many TEM- 1 + isolates remained sensitive to therapeutic concentrations of <b>mezlocillin</b> ( 64 mg/ 1) to the other a-aminopenicillins. These data suggested that the enzyme afforded weaker protection against <b>mezlocillin</b> than against azlocillin and ampicillin and we attempted to relate this finding to its hydrolytic activity. Extracted TEM- 1 /Mactamase hydrolysed high concentrations of <b>mezlocillin</b> more rapidly than ampicillin and azlocillin; however, <b>mezlocillin</b> was calculated to be the weakest substrate at the low concentrations which {{are likely to be}} obtainable in the bacterial cell.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics and bacteriological effect of <b>mezlocillin</b> in experimental meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes and two Escherichia coli strains. The half-life of <b>mezlocillin</b> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was approximately twice that in serum of experimentally infected animals, and the penetration of drug into CSF was 5 to 15 % after a single dose and 5 to 20 % after continuous-infusion experiments. The bactericidal titer in CSF for both susceptible E. coli and L. monocytogenes was 1 : 8, whereas for the resistant E. coli strain, titers were less than 1 : 2 after single doses of 50 or 100 mg of <b>mezlocillin</b> per kg and 1 : 4 with continuous infusion. After single-dose and continuous-infusion experiments, the bacteriological effect of <b>mezlocillin</b> in experimental L. monocytogenes infections was similar to that of ampicillin. <b>Mezlocillin</b> reduced the colony counts of of susceptible E. coli in CSF by 90 % or more after a single dose or continuous infusion but had no appreciable effect on resistant E. coli after a single dose of 50 mg/kg. In contrast, a single dose of 100 mg of <b>mezlocillin</b> per kg eradicated the resistant strain from CSF, despite a bactericidal titer in CSF of less than 1 : 2. This unexpected finding prompted us to evaluate the effect of serum on the in vitro susceptibilities of selected coliforms to <b>mezlocillin.</b> The activity of <b>mezlocillin</b> against one susceptible and four resistant strains of gram-negative, enteric bacilli was enhanced manyfold by the addition of fresh rabbit serum; this effect was abolished by heating the serum at 56 degrees C for 30 min. This interaction of <b>mezlocillin</b> and serum against coliform bacteria should be examined in a larger number of experimentally infected animals and in specimens obtained from mezlocillin-treated infants...|$|E
40|$|The efficacies of <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin, each {{alone and}} in {{combination}} with gentamicin, in the therapy of experimental left-sided Enterobacter aerogenes endocarditis in rabbits were compared. Each beta-lactam was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 180 mg/kg every 6 h either alone or with gentamicin (1. 7 mg/kg intramuscularly every 8 h). Bacterial populations {{at the start of}} therapy (7 days after initiation of infection) were 9 to 10 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation. Ticarcillin produced concentrations in serum that were twice those produced by <b>mezlocillin,</b> but the therapeutic ratios of <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin (ratio of peak level in serum to MBC) were the same. All of the therapeutic regimens given for either 5 or 10 days were effective in reducing vegetation counts when compared with the untreated controls (P less than 0. 01 for all comparisons), except <b>mezlocillin</b> alone and ticarcillin alone, which caused insignificant reductions in counts after 5 days of therapy (P greater than 0. 05). After 10 days of therapy, the only regimen that was significantly different from another was that of <b>mezlocillin</b> plus gentamicin, which was significantly better than that of ticarcillin alone (P less than 0. 01). These studies document that <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin were both effective in reducing the numbers of E. aerogenes CFU in vegetations in rabbits with experimental endocarditis when the drugs were given over a prolonged course. More rapid and extensive reduction in vegetation counts was achieved with combinations of an aminoglycoside plus <b>mezlocillin</b> or ticarcillin. Mortality was significantly less among rabbits treated with <b>mezlocillin</b> plus gentamicin...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the blood and}} uterine tissue concentration of <b>mezlocillin,</b> a broadspectrum penicillin. Methods: We adapted a liquid chromatographic method to measure <b>mezlocillin</b> in serum and tissue. <b>Mezlocillin</b> reference standard was diluted in water, chromatographed on a reversed phase C 18 column eluted at 1. 5 ml/min with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (1 : 3 v:v), and detected spectrophotometrically at 210 nm. <b>Mezlocillin</b> was administered to 14 premenopausal women scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy.

40|$|<b>Mezlocillin</b> {{is a new}} broad-spectrum semisynthetic {{penicillin}} {{that has}} shown encouraging in vitro activity against the infecting organisms most likely to cause mortality and morbidity in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The serum clearances and urine recoveries of <b>mezlocillin,</b> ampicillin, and carbenicillin were compared after the intravenous administration of single 3 -g doses. The peak mean serum concentrations of <b>mezlocillin</b> and carbenicillin were 269 and 278 μg/ml, respectively, whereas the peak ampicillin level was lower at 167 μg/ml. The terminal half-life of <b>mezlocillin,</b> 66 min, was {{not significantly different from}} those of ampicillin and carbencillin (63 and 77 min, respectively). Recoveries of <b>mezlocillin,</b> ampicillin, and carbenicillin from urine over 6 -h periods after drug dosage were 45, 61, and 80 %, respectively. A further study in 11 cancer patients examined serum maintenance levels of <b>mezlocillin</b> when 3 -g doses were given intravenously every 4 h for at least 7 consecutive days. After 3 days of therapy, the mean serum concentrations were maintained above 50 μg/ml. Although therapeutic efficacy was not an objective of this study, all of three documented bacterial infections were cured, and no serious toxicity was encountered...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of azlocillin and <b>mezlocillin,</b> new semisynthetic ureido penicillins, was investigated and {{compared with that}} of other known β-lactam antibiotics. At a concentration of 25 μg/ml, azlocillin inhibited 74 % of Enterobacter, 97 % of Proteus mirabilis, 64 % of Citrobacter, 91 % of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 82 % of Bacteroides strains tested. <b>Mezlocillin</b> inhibited 86 % of Shigella, 96 % of Enterobacter, 80 % of indole-positive Proteus, 88 % of Bacteroides, and 63 % of Pseudomonas strains tested. Azlocillin was more active against Pseudomonas than was ticarcillin, carbenicillin, or <b>mezlocillin.</b> <b>Mezlocillin</b> was more active than carbenicillin and ampicillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Serratia, and Bacteroides. Azlocillin and <b>mezlocillin</b> were less active than cefazolin against β-lactamase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains but more active than cefazolin against Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia strains. Both compounds showed activity equivalent to that of cefoxitin against Bacteroides isolates. Both agents were destroyed by many of the β-lactamases from gram-negative organisms...|$|E
40|$|A single, {{intramuscular}} dose of 2 g of <b>mezlocillin</b> {{was used}} for the treatment of 158 patients with gonorrhoea. In only three out of 144 patients with urogential gonorrhoea who were re-examined did the treatment fail. Of 12 patients with pharyngeal gonorrhoea who were examined after treatment 10 were treated successfully with the same dose. The sensitivities of the gonococci to <b>mezlocillin</b> and penicillin G correlated well, although <b>mezlocillin</b> seemed to be active at lower concentrations on both highly sensitive and less sensitive isolates...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>mezlocillin</b> at two dosages {{were studied}} {{over the course}} of therapy in 12 patients receiving the drug for the treatment of infections. Patients received an initial dosing regimen of 4 g every 6 h or 5 g every 8 h, which was switched to the alternative regimen after 5 days of treatment. Both drug regimens demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic characteristics, which suggests that the reported dose-dependent elimination of <b>mezlocillin</b> is not an important factor in the clinical use of <b>mezlocillin</b> at the dosages currently used...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mezlocillin</b> was {{compared}} with carbenicillin and 0. 9 % NaCl as placebo in a double-blind manner {{to determine its}} effect in vivo on hemostasis in normal volunteers. Eighteen subjects were randomized to receive <b>mezlocillin,</b> 4 g every 6 h; carbenicillin, 7. 5 g every 6 h; or placebo, 50 ml every 6 h, each given for 20 intravenous doses unless the template bleeding time after 10 doses was greater than 15 min. Template bleeding times were determined before the dose 1 and 1 h after doses 10 and 20. Five of six (83 %) subjects receiving carbenicillin developed template bleeding time prolongation to greater than 21 min, and two of six (33 %) subjects receiving <b>mezlocillin</b> and one of six (17 %) subjects receiving carbenicillin had mild template bleeding time prolongations of less than 13 min. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time) were normal in all subjects, and blood salicylate levels were negative. Thus, in standard therapeutic doses, <b>mezlocillin</b> was less likely than carbenicillin to prolong the template bleeding time above normal (P = 0. 04) and, when prolongation occurred with <b>mezlocillin,</b> it was mild. These data support the selective use of <b>mezlocillin</b> in patients {{at increased risk for}} bleeding and who require therapy with an antipseudomonal penicillin...|$|E
40|$|The anti-pseudomonas {{activities}} of azlocillin and <b>mezlocillin</b> {{were compared with}} that of ticarcillin. We measured the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of the three drugs against 20 different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and found significantly lower values for azlocillin than for the other two drugs. We then infused 5 g of each drug into 10 volunteers on three consecutive days and determined the serum levels of the three antibiotics at 1 -h intervals from 1 to 6 h after injection. The levels of azlocillin were significantly higher than those of <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin (at 1 h: 236. 55 μg/ml ± 12. 9 for azlocillin, 192. 45 μg/ml ± 28. 8 for <b>mezlocillin,</b> and 131. 5 μg/ml ± 10. 9 for ticarcillin). The inhibitory and bactericidal {{activities of}} the sera obtained 1 and 6 h after the injection against the same 20 strains of P. aeruginosa demonstrated a significantly greater anti-pseudomonas activity of azlocillin when compared with <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin; <b>mezlocillin</b> and ticarcillin had approximately the same activity. The mean values for bactericidal activity against the strains tested were 1 / 32 for azlocillin, 1 / 8 for <b>mezlocillin,</b> and 1 / 8 for ticarcillin.

The CSF was drained through a ventricular catheter, while mock CSF was infused into the lumbar subarachnoid space. The patient soon recovered to her clinical status previous to intraventricular <b>mezlocillin</b> application. Side effects of CSF exchange were not seen. Under continued antiepileptic medication no more seizures occurred. It is concluded that high doses of intraventricular <b>mezlocillin</b> have proconvulsive effects.

The response rates for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, the three most common gram-negative infections, were 42, 64, and 70 %, respectively. <b>Mezlocillin</b> was well tolerated; the only toxicity attributable to this antibiotic was a skin rash in one patient. The formation of a false-positive urine protein reaction by <b>mezlocillin</b> was noted. This study demonstrated that <b>mezlocillin</b> administered as a single agent was effective against some infections in myelosuppressed cancer patients. The response rate for Klebsiella sp. infections was especially encouraging.
