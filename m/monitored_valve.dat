Two conditions were considered in this study which are good condition valve and leak valve. There are two objective of the study which is to detect acoustic emission parameter {{and to develop a}} classification method to <b>monitor</b> <b>valve</b> condition by using acoustic emission technique. The study is accomplished by analyzing the parameter hits and average rms. A hydraulic bench was used to provide water to the test rig. The first experiment is to <b>monitor</b> good <b>valve</b> condition. It is done by analyze the hits and rms collected for every rotation of the wheel handle. Then, the graph of hits plotted is compared between the graphs plotted by Hafizi (2008) to see the different characteristic of different valve. The second experiment is to <b>monitor</b> the leak <b>valve.</b> Two different valves were used in the second experiment which are gate valve and check valve. Sand and then screw was put in the valve as to make the valve leak. Then, the parameter hits and rms is measured to analyze the different between good condition valve and leak valve. The results show that there is acoustic emission activity occur when there is leak in the valve and the activity can be detected by using the acoustic emission sensor. It is also prove that the different leak will emit different acoustic emission energy...|$|R

40|$|Valve {{stiction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of poor performance in control loops. This paper presents a procedure which allows stiction quantification. The technique permits one to estimate the unknown real stem position, and moreover, it does not need any process knowledge and requires only the data normally registered in industrial plants. It is pointed out that the real problem consists of the lack of knowledge about the true value of stiction. A general methodology is proposed to discard data for which quantification is very likely to give wrong indications and to restrict its application to appropriate cases. Simulations show that several sources of perturbations can be eliminated, thus improving the reliability of stiction evaluation. Results are confirmed by application to industrial data: a significant number of valves are analyzed for repeated acquisitions before and after plant shutdown. The proposed procedure seems to be a valid methodology to <b>monitor</b> <b>valve</b> stiction and to schedule and check valve maintenance...|$|R
500|$|Airlines have {{reported}} 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, {{at various points}} during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation {{has led to the}} tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth.

40|$|Recent advancements in sensor {{technology}} {{have made it}} possible to collect enormous amounts of data in real time. However, because of the sheer volume of data most of it will never be inspected by an algorithm, much less a human being. One way to mitigate this problem is to perform some type of anomaly (novelty / interestingness/ surprisingness) detection and flag unusual patterns for further inspection by humans or more CPU intensive algorithms. Most current solutions are “custom made” for particular domains, such as ECG <b>monitoring,</b> <b>valve</b> pressure <b>monitoring,</b> etc. This customization requires extensive effort by domain expert. Furthermore, handcrafted systems tend to be very brittle to concept drift. In this demonstration, we will show an online anomaly detection system that {{does not need to be}} customized for individual domains, yet performs with exceptionally high precision/recall. The system is based on the recently introduced idea of time series bitmaps. To demonstrate the universality of our system, we will allow testing on independently annotated datasets from domains as diverse as ECGs, Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, video surveillance, and respiratory data.

40|$|Summary and Conclusion Emergency Shutdown (ESD) {{valves and}} High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) valves are final {{elements}} in Safety Instrumented Systems. Proof or functional testing are performed at specific intervals {{in order to}} ensure the valves’ function. For these type of valves, such tests may require costly shutdowns. For a final element, like a valve, the interval between proof tests are by performance based standards like IEC 61505 / 61511, related to the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) for the element’s complete function. Partial Stroke Testing (PST) can reduce the time between such tests. PST is performed by allowing the valve to start closing, and to start reopening before the process is interrupted. By performing a partial test at a shorter interval, a fraction of the dangerous undetected failures, the PST coverage, are tested more often. This will reduce the PFD and imply that the proof test interval can be extended, still achieving the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Three systems for PST have been evaluated: The Emerson FieldVue DVC 6000 SIS, the Drallim Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and the Crane ValveWatch II. ValveWatch and Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring</b> provides leak testing in open and closed position, respectively. Leak testing on an open valve is treated as a partial test and is included in the PST coverage. FieldVue can not be used on hydraulic operated valves. Three ESD valves and one HIPPS valve on the Kollsnes gas processing plant have been analyzed. Two systems have been evaluated for each valve. A Failure Mode, E. ects and Diagnostic Analysis has been performed on the tested parts of each valve’s complete function. Based on this analysis, the PST coverage and increased test intervals are calculated. The PST coverage found for the hydraulic operated ESD gate valves are 66 % and 74 % for ValveWatch and Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring,</b> respectively. For the pneumatic operated ESD ball valve, a PST coverage of 21 % has been found for FieldVue and 56 % for Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring.</b> The calculated intervals between functional tests to achive a SIL 2 rating, are between 0, 54 and 0, 89 years for these ESD valves. SIL 2 corresponds to a PFD < 10 - 2. For the ESD valves, new control circuits with lower failure rates should be designed in order to improve the results. Today’s one year proof test interval on ESD valves seems not to be in accordance with the standard used in this project, i. e to achieve SIL 2 the proof test interval should be reduced. A PST coverage of 100 % and 0 % has been found on the HIPPS solenoid valve for Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and FieldVue, respectively. The PST coverage for the valve and actuator is 53 % for both systems. Based on an inital annual test interval for the overall pressure protection system, is PST, by the system with best coverage, roughly estimated to increase the test interval by 76 %. The results are highly dependent on the choices and assumptions made in this project. A closer study of experience data could have increased the quality of the analysis. Such data is not found easily available. The results are assumed to be relatively conservative. Deeper involvement of professionals with operational experience from relevant areas would probably also have improved the quality. The Drallim Smart <b>Valve</b> <b>Monitoring</b> has achieved the best results in this analysis. ValveWatch and FieldVue would improve their PST coverage if ESD solenoids were tested. They are also able to monitor actual shutdowns and may contribute to document a shutdown as proof test. These systems also make more measurements and may be better suited for predictive maintenance purposes. ValveWatch has achieved the highest PST coverage for a valve separately, because of its leak test. All the evaluated systems will give increased knowledge about the valve’s condition, and thereby improve safety. The PFD will be substantially reduced. Future needs at Kollsnes should be analyzed further, and an eventual installation of such systems should be done according to these needs. </p...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis requiring surgery in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of subaortic stenosis. BackgroundClassic teachings emphasize aortic regurgitation as the most common complication associated with discrete subaortic stenosis. We hypothesized that significant aortic stenosis may also be an important valve lesion associated with this condition. MethodsClinical outcomes in patients with subaortic stenosis were examined. The primary outcome of interest was the prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis requiring surgery (surgical valvotomy or valve replacement). Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with the need for surgery for aortic stenosis. ResultsOne hundred twenty-one adults with subaortic stenosis (median age 32 years) were evaluated in our clinic. Associated lesions were common: 23 % had bicuspid valves and 21 % had coarctation of the aorta. Seventy-nine percent of the patients had at least 1 surgical resection of subaortic tissue (median age 12 years). Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was present in 16 % of patients (19 of 121), 3 of whom required surgical intervention in adulthood. Twenty-six percent of patients (32 of 121) required surgery for valvular aortic stenosis. Valve surgery for aortic stenosis was more common in patients with concomitant bicuspid aortic valve disease (p = 0. 008), coarctation of the aorta (p = 0. 03), and supravalvular stenosis (p = 0. 02).

Because the valve arm in the system with high voltage and large capacity is generally made up of hundreds of sub-modules, in order to ensure the voltage balance between each sub-module, VBC has a high requirement on the data disposal speed of the sub-modules, usually less than 100  μs. It is a huge challenge for the valve control design to achieve this high speed control balance technique of large-scale sub-modules. The unique circulation phenomenon of modular multi-level technique will cause the increase of the converter valve current stress and the loss level. If serious enough, it may make the system lose the balance and be unable to operate normally. For this reason, the design of circulating current control strategy is also a key factor in valve control.|$|R
40|$|A 130 keV {{injector}} {{is developed}} for the NDCX-II facility. It consists of a 10. 9 cm diameter lithium doped alumina-silicate ion source heated to {approx} 1300 C and 3 electrodes. Other components include a segmented Rogowski coil for current and beam position <b>monitoring,</b> a gate <b>valve,</b> pumping ports, a focusing solenoid, a steering coil and space for inspection and maintenance access. Significant design challenges including managing the 3 - 4 kW of power dissipation from the source heater, temperature uniformity across the emitter surface, quick access for frequent ion source replacement, mechanical alignment with tight tolerance, and structural stabilization of the cantilevered 27 -inch OD graded HV ceramic column. The injector fabrication is scheduled to complete by May 2011, and assembly and installation is scheduled to complete {{by the beginning of}} July. The Neutralized Drift Compression eXperiment (NDCX-II) is for the study of high energy density physics and inertial fusion energy research utilizing a lithium ion (Li+) beam with a current of 93 mA and a pulse length of 500 ns (compressed to 1 ns at the target). The injector {{is one of the most}} complicated sections of the NDCX-II accelerator demanding significant design and fabrication resources. It needs to accommodate a relatively large ion source (10. 9 cm), a high heat load (3 - 4 kW) and specific beam optics developed from the physics model. Some specific design challenges are noted in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{practical}} in our country’s {{industry and}} global industry that safety accidents occur frequently and major production accidents cause painful price. Reflection on the intelligent monitoring is generated {{based on the}} harsh reality. Generally speaking, the intelligent monitoring refers to supervision and control of plant operation safety through intelligent programming by collecting and integrating wisdom of an engineering designer, a plant operator and an equipment manufacturer. A valve is called the “throat ” in various kinds of pipe network systems of enterprises in petroleum, electricity and chemistry industries. Operational safety of industrial valves causes high attention. According to relevant data statistics, one third of significant production accidents occurring in the world every year are caused by valve accidents. Among the several major and significant petrochemical safety accidents occurring in our country in recent years, operators were neglectful and careless and opened or closed valves in a wrong way to cause explosion; in the electric industry all over the world, significant accidents such as electric leakage and power outage caused by improper valve management brought immeasurable losses, such as the significant Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station Accident in USA, to normal operation and people’s property safety and so forth in industrial production. Damages and losses of such kind of accidents have brought very serious influences to relevant industries and society. The paper describes the intelligent <b>monitoring</b> with the <b>valve</b> safety problem of big probability events as instances...|$|R
40|$|The valve {{movement}} {{pattern of the}} freshwater bivalve Corbicula japonica (C. japonica) following exposure to test chemicals was monitored. We conducted the exposure test with two heavy metal compounds, cadmium chloride ($CdCl_ 2 $; 0, 0. 1, 1, or 10 mg/L) and copper (II) chloride ($CuCl_ 2 $; 0, 0. 1, 1, or 10 mg/L) in a continuous flow system. After a pre-exposure period in a test chamber, which was filled with dechlorinated tap water for 1 h, the bivalves {{were exposed to the}} test chemicals for 3 h. After that, only dechlorinated tap water was released again into the test chamber for 2 h. Thus, the valve movements were continuously recorded for a total of 6 h. On exposure to $CdCl_ 2 $ (1 and 10 mg/L), the valve movement of C. japonica closed. However, the valve movements of C. japonica in all $CdCl_ 2 $ groups recovered after termination of the exposure. C. japonica showed decreased distance between the valves on exposure to $CuCl_ 2 $ (0. 1, 1, and 10 mg/L). However, C. japonica restarted their valve movements only in the recovery period at 0. 1 mg/L $CuCl_ 2 $. Therefore, we conclude that real-time <b>monitoring</b> of the <b>valve</b> movement of C. japonica is a useful method to detect both the contamination with a toxicant and recovery of the water quality in an aquatic ecosystem. In addition, it can be used for the assurance of the water quality...|$|R
