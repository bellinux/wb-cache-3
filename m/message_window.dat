50|$|Chat room users {{communicate}} through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a <b>message</b> <b>window,</b> and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message {{to be sent}} to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room {{so that it can be}} displayed in the <b>message</b> <b>window.</b> The <b>message</b> <b>window</b> allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.|$|E

50|$|A Softpedia {{review of}} QIP 2006 {{mentioned}} its unique feature (at the time) of tabbed message windows—instead of a <b>message</b> <b>window</b> for each chat session, one window with several tabs is shown. Since this feature's introduction, ICQ Version 6.0 now includes this feature, {{as do the}} multi-service clients Pidgin, Miranda IM, and Trillian. Other features include integrated mail.ru e-mail client, and {{a wider range of}} emoticons. QIP presents no advertisements in the application windows; this is described as a security advantage.|$|E
5000|$|UIML (User Interface Markup Language) is an XML-based user {{interface}} markup language for defining {{user interface}}s on computers.Basically UIML tries {{to reduce the}} work needed to develop user interfaces. It allows you to describe the user interface in declarative terms (i.e. as text) and abstract it. Abstracting means that you don't exactly specify how the user interface is going to look, but rather what elements are to be shown, and how should they behave. For example, to describe a <b>message</b> <b>window,</b> you could write: ...|$|E
50|$|Version 0.4 of Miranda IM was {{released}} on April 7, 2005. This was the first version to have Yahoo! protocol bundled with the official release. Other major changes included the removal of contact list and database module from the core into plugins. As a result, there were 4 variations of contact list modules: the original clist_classic, multi-window contact list clist_mw, modern contact list clist_modern, and nicer contact list with extensive UI customization clist_nicer. Other popular plugins released within this period included tabbed <b>message</b> <b>window</b> (tabsrmm and scriver), HTML based message log support IE view, scripting plugin mbot, and the meta contact plugin.|$|E

5000|$|User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) is a {{technology}} introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 to combat shatter attack exploits. By {{making use of}} Mandatory Integrity Control, it prevents processes with a lower [...] "integrity level" [...] (IL) from sending messages to higher IL processes (except for a very specific set of UI <b>messages).</b> <b>Window</b> <b>messages</b> are designed to communicate user action to processes. However, {{they can be used}} to run arbitrary code in the receiving process' context. This can be used by a malicious low IL process to run arbitrary code {{in the context of a}} higher IL process, which constitutes an unauthorized privilege escalation. By restricting access to some vectors for code execution and data injection, UIPI can mitigate these kinds of attacks.|$|R
50|$|MSN Messenger {{received}} a major upgrade to version 7.0 on April 7, 2005. This version brought wink features {{that were previously}} only available in threedegrees. This version also advertised items to sell to you including animated display pictures, emoticons and backgrounds. The contact list window style was also updated to match instant <b>message</b> <b>windows.</b> This version also introduced the Xbox Live Integration feature. This is the last version of MSN Messenger that runs on Windows 98 and Windows Me. This version also introduced digital ink and handwriting recognition support.|$|R

The <b>message</b> <b>window</b> size, presence of scrolling, a single <b>message</b> <b>window</b> vs. message windows for each participant, and message persistence were systematically varied for pairs of interlocutors engaged in the same decision-making task. Participants produced more total words and more turns in conditions with larger windows and in those with scrolling, while separate windows conditioned even larger increases on these measures. Turn sizes were smaller in the latter conditions and response times were faster. In the persistent separate-window conditions, messages from the partner intervened before participants completed responses in over half of the messages...|$|E

40|$|Failure {{detectors}} {{are one of}} {{the fundamental}} components for building a distributed system with high availability. In order to maintain the efficiency and scalability of failure detection in a complicated large-scale distributed system, accrual failure detectors that can adapt to multiple applications have been studied extensively. In this paper, an new accrual failure detector—LA-FD with low system overhead has been proposed specifically for current mobile network equipment on the Internet whose processing power, memory space and power supply are all constrained. It does not rely on the probability distribution of message transmission time, or on the maintenance of a history <b>message</b> <b>window.</b> By simple calculation, LA-FD provides adaptive failure detection service with high accuracy to multiple upper applications. The related experiments and results have also been presented...|$|E
30|$|In 802.11 WLANs, devices can be {{deployed}} in ad hoc mode, where devices {{can communicate with}} each other without a base station. Also, in order for power conservation, 802.11 MAC (media access control) provides a PSM (power saving mechanism), by which the devices can turn off their radios and stay in doze mode for power saving after a certain period of idle state [8]. The devices can buffer traffic for a certain period if the destination devices stay in doze mode, and during ATIM (announcement traffic indication <b>message)</b> <b>window,</b> all the devices become active for ATIM frame transmissions. When the ATIM window terminates, the devices having received or successfully transmitted an ATIM frame keep awake in the remaining BI (beacon interval) for data transmissions, while others enter into doze for power conservation.|$|E
40|$|Theories {{accounting}} for the process of primary task resumption following an interruption {{have focused on the}} suspension and retrieval of a specific goal (Altmann & Trafton, 2002). The ability to recall the spatial location of where in the task one was prior to being interrupted may also be important. We show that being able to maintain a spatial representation of the primary task facilitates task resumption. Participants were interrupted by an instant <b>message</b> <b>window</b> that either partially or fully occluded the primary task interface. Reaction time measures show that participants were faster at resuming in the partial occlusion condition. In addition, eye track data suggest that participants were more accurate at returning to where they left off, suggesting {{that they were able to}} maintain a spatial representation of the task and use this information to resume more quickly...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an awareness}} application called Tickertape. Tickertape {{is a tool}} that displays event notifications {{in the form of}} scrolling messages across a single-line window. The Tickertape <b>message</b> <b>window</b> provides an interface to a world of highly tailorable transient information. We provide an overview of Tickertape features and then discuss its specific use within a semi-commercial research organisation. We note that although Tickertape's evolution was incidental rather than purposeful, it is being extensively used within our organisation. Usage data and interviews suggest that there is a select core group of users who use Tickertape for both work and leisure. Other more casual users use the tool sporadically for leisure purposes only. We highlight our current goal which is to optimise Tickertape usage within the work environment. We hope to achieve this by enhancing the Tickertape user interface and encouraging its widespread use within the organisation. Our long-term vision [...] ...|$|E
40|$|NLEdit is {{a generic}} {{graphical}} user interface for the preprocessing of Fortran namelist input files. The interface consists of a menu system, a <b>message</b> <b>window,</b> a help system, and data entry forms. A form is generated for each namelist. The form has an input field for each namelist variable along with a one-line description of that variable. Detailed help information, default values, and minimum and maximum allowable values can all be displayed via menu picks. Inputs are processed through a scientific calculator program that allows complex equations to be used instead of simple numeric inputs. A custom user interface is generated simply by entering information about the namelist input variables into an ASCII file. There {{is no need to}} learn a new graphics system or programming language. NLEdit {{can be used as a}} stand-alone program or as part of a larger {{graphical user interface}}. Although NLEdit is intended for files using namelist format, it can be easily modified to handle other file formats. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In the {{wireless}} ad hoc network, utilizing the multiple channels at Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is on {{of the key}} techniques to improve the network performance. It {{can be done by}} multi-channel MAC to utilize the channels resource as much as possible. Wireless nodes are usually powered by battery and thus are limited in power capacity. The IEEE 802. 11 Power Saving Mechanism (PSM) is used to conserve energy for the ad hoc networks by allowing nodes to enter doze mode when {{there is no need for}} data exchange. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and adaptive protocol, named H-MMAC, by adopting IEEE 802. 11 PSM. In H-MMAC, nodes exchange control messages on default channel to negotiate the data channel during the ATIM (Ad hoc traffic Indication <b>Message)</b> <b>window.</b> The difference of H-MMAC compared to other multi-channel MAC protocols is that the other nodes can transmit data packets on data channels based on the network traffic load. This means H-MMAC can utilize the channel resources more efficiently. The simulation results show that our proposed H-MMAC improves the network performance significantly in terms of aggregate throughput, average delay and energy efficiency.
