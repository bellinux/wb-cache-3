5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity.

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge.

5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abandonment {{of these kinds}} of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may {{have played a role in}} these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed white {{light and the}} upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes detectable.

5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and suggest that other events <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low number of archaeological sites that {{can be attributed to}} the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his {{assertion}} was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extinctions.|$|E

5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly {{the same amount of}} {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700cm per year in the east and over 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fragmented nature of political power.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{formation of the}} Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud {{may be the result}} of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{were able}} to finish landing their troops, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{impression}} of significant forces {{in front of the}} Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles. Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied beliefs about the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.|$|E
