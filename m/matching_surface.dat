40|$|Abstract—Three {{dimensional}} surface matching is {{an important}} problem in computer vision. The process of surface matching is to match similar regions or correspondences across multiple surfaces with unknown relative poses. Many surface descriptors for finding correspondences have been proposed. However, most of these approaches {{have been used in}} triangle mesh surfaces. In this paper, a local surface descriptor constituting moving least square (MLS) surface representation, differential angle calculation, and Zernike moments is proposed to find correspondences in unconstraint point set surfaces. The MLS projection is applied to generate a differential angle map described the geometric information. Then, Zernike moments are used to provide surface descriptors with rotation invariant. In addition, a congruent consistency method is proposed to find the reliable correspondences. To conclude, the experimental results show that the approach outperforms the original spin image method [2], and has slightly better performance than a modified spin image method presented in this paper. Moreover, the proposed approach has good matching performance both in terms of <b>matching</b> <b>surface</b> by using variety of descriptor size or <b>matching</b> <b>surface</b> among different resolutions.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} partial <b>matching</b> of <b>surfaces</b> represented by triangular meshes. Our method <b>matches</b> <b>surface</b> regions that are numerically and topologically dissimilar, but approximate similar regions. We introduce novel local surface descriptors which efficiently represent the geometry of local regions of the surface. The descriptors are defined independently of the underlying triangulation, and form a compatible representation that allows <b>matching</b> of <b>surfaces</b> with different triangulations. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of partial matching of large meshes, we introduce the abstraction of salient geometric features and present a method to construct them. A salient geometric feature is a compound high-level feature of non-trivial local shapes. We show that {{a relatively small number}} of such salient geometric features characterizes the surface well for various similarity applications. Matching salient geometric features is based on indexing rotation-invariant features and a voting scheme accelerated by geometric hashing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a number of applications, such as computing self-similarity, alignments and sub-parts similarity...|$|R
