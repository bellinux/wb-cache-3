5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though he throws his slow curveball much <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E

He won at New York 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place.

5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> males.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue {{from the}} South African tour {{affected}} Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs {{at an average}} of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was very effective in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.|$|E

5|$|Males tend to {{move over}} longer {{distances}} than females. The average home range size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens {{that were once}} captured tended to be captured <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).|$|E
5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} hosts more than 12 species of helminth, with Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae {{reported}} {{to be the most}} dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> the adult. A new species of Corynebacterium—C. ciconiae—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought {{to be part of the}} natural flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera Dendrolaelaps and Macrocheles—have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, McCool took 57 {{first-class}} wickets at {{a bowling}} average of 17.82; {{he was the}} fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing {{to have a new}} ball available after every 55 overs, <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, fast bowling dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used heavily in the tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three times, his best return being 7/78 against Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>than</b> normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
