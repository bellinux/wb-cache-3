40|$|Thermal shock {{resistance}} {{is a key}} property of refractory materials. Its determination and prediction {{is essential for the}} design of structural refractories as well as lining materials. Young’s modulus of elasticity (E) is a crucial parameter for the calculation of thermal {{shock resistance}}. For all investigated carbon-bonded alumina composition a significant increase of E was observed. This increase was attributed to a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the composite constituents. Besides others, the graphite content as well as the maximum alumina particle size were identified as crucial factors influencing E(T). Furthermore, the influence of the porosity on E was shown and existing models were fitted to the experimental data for future predictions of E. Finally a metal <b>melt</b> <b>filter</b> structure was investigated to investigate the relationship between its strut Young’s modulus and the structures’ E at high temperatures. Further research should address the filter topic since it was uncertain how to find the normal modes of those structures...|$|E

The results confirmed that numerous cells passed through 0. 4 -μm, 0. 2 -μm, and even 0. 1 -μm filters. Interestingly, filtration increased cell culturability from the melted ice, yielding many isolates related to high-G+C gram-positive bacteria. Comparisons between parallel filtered and nonfiltered cultures showed that (i) the proportion of 0. 2 -μm-filterable cells was higher in the filtered cultures after short incubations but this difference diminished after several months, (ii) more isolates were obtained from filtered (1, 290 isolates) than from nonfiltered (447 isolates) cultures, and (iii) the filtration and liquid medium cultivation increased isolate diversity (Proteobacteria; Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides; high-G+C gram-positive; and spore-forming, low-G+C gram-positive bacteria). Many isolates maintained their small cell sizes after recultivation and were phylogenetically novel or related to other ultramicrobacteria.

40|$|The use of {{plastics}} in the automotive industries has increased {{significantly in the}} past few years. Concerns for the environment and the management of waste is encouraging the recycling and proper use of scrap material. Among others, polypropylene (PP) based bumpers are targeted for recycling because of their large volume and relatively simple material composition. Most of these bumpers are coated with polyurethane based paint which becomes dispersed into the matrix during reprocessing influencing the material properties. This seemed to be an important issue to investigate as it was shown by some other workers that the lowering of properties by the presence of paint particles was more significant than the material deterioration itself. So, with the complete recycling process, {{it is important to understand}} how the dispersed phase influences the processing and later the behaviour of the matrix so that in future investigations this knowledge can be utilised in further development of the recycled material. This has been the main theme of the project with the following major objectives: (i) to remove paint particles from the painted PP bumpers by melt filtration technique (ii) to determine the rheological and mechanical properties of the rubber toughened PP based composites dispersed with paint particles and glass microspheres and (iii) to understand the effect of dispersed phase on these properties by studying the morphology of the composites. Both commercially recycled material and real system blends prepared in the laboratory were studied to observe the effect of dispersed paint on the polymer matrix. Firstly the following materials were characterised using tensile, impact and rheological tests: virgin bumper bar grade material (PPIEPDMlta 1 c); two batches of material injection moulded from the virgin grade and painted with different levels of paint layers as found on car bumpers (unfiltered and <b>melt</b> <b>filtered)</b> and recycled painted bumpers (unfiltered and <b>melt</b> <b>filtered).</b> Extrusion <b>melt</b> filtration was chosen to remove the paint particles from the pp phase and the quantitative measurement of the dispersed phase was done by digital image analysis. Result of this analysis showed that only about 50 % paint was removed following filtration. Little variation was observed in viscosity values for all the samples with unfiltered batches showing slightly higher and filtered samples showing slightly lower viscosity compared to the virgin material. The increased value for the first case was attributed for the paint particles acting as the particulate phase in the matrix. On the other hand, lower viscosity was caused by deterioration of material with chain scission of PP. The elongation and impact strength of the paint dispersed batches decreased drastically compared to the virgin material as the paint particles acted as crack initiators and propagators. For the blends prepared, well characterised paint particles were dispersed into the PP/rubber/talc and PP/rubber matrix to be used as the &quot;real&quot; system. Talc itself is used as a filler in the commercial grades to impart greater stiffness, so composites without talc were worth examining to compare the effect of paint over talc. Also &quot;model&quot; filled systems with glass micro spheres were studied to observe the relative importance of particle shape and filler concentration. The choice to use glass as a model filler was primarily based on its spherical shape, non-deformable nature and relatively small surface area. The glass filled systems served as a comparison and helped in the interpretation of the rheological and mechanical properties of the paint dispersed in the rubber toughened talc filled and unfilled PP. The rheological study over the processing temperature range showed that the presence of small fraction of the dispersed phase (upto 1. 9 vol% for glass beads and 2. 7 vol% for paint particles) had insignificant effect on viscosity and at these levels the effect of particle size, particle size distribution and particle shape can be neglected. Only with increased filler fraction (5 vol %) a trend in increased viscosity was observed. From mechanical testing it was observed that the retention of tensile yield strength was nearly 100 % but elongation at break dropped significantly compared to the base matrices. This reduction was explained by poor interphase between filler and matrix. The modulus values for glass bead filled PP/rubber matrix showed an increasing tendency for high rigidity of the filler itself whereas for paint filled matrix it dropped below the base matrix value. For PP/rubber/talc matrix the scenario was different where a decrease in modulus was observed for all the composites. This was explained by the much high rigidity of talc particles over glass beads and paint particles. Though small sized talc particles acted as reinforcing fillers when added to PP/rubber system, the inclusion of second dispersed phase could not overshadow its effect on matrix thus failing as a weak structure. The drop in modulus for paint dispersed matrices was more significant indicating that irregular shaped paint particles had a smaller degree of interaction with the base matrix compared to spherical glass particles. A sharp decrease in impact strength observed for all the composites again explained the poor adhesion between matrix and dispersed phase which was also attributed from the photomicrographs of the fractured specimens. A separated microstructure was revealed for the composites which emphasised the explanation that the inclusions reduced the ability of the elastomer phase to absorb applied energy by reducing the distance between particles. A decrease in fracture energy and toughness for all the composites was also explained by the same. Models were proposed to predict crack propagation through glass bead and paint particle dispersed in the PP/rubber/talc matrices. For glass beads, crack propagation through the composite was attracted to the equator of particles so fractured surfaces showed clear hemispherical holes and top surfaces of debonded particles. For irregular paint dispersed composites, crack propagated through the interphase of filler and matrix thus debonding the paint particles. The composites under study were also related in terms of their rheology, morphology and mechanical properties. A separated microstructure of the composites as observed from the micrographs leads to the explanation of the slight increase in viscosity of filled composites over unfilled ones. Also poor interphase between filler and matrix leads to decreased property values in mechanical tests compared to base matrices...|$|R

The blue ice was <b>melted</b> and <b>filtered,</b> and the micrometeorites were handpicked from the collected “glacial sands”. The weight of the micrometeorites in the blue ice was estimated from the abundance of recovered micrometeorites and the solar noble gas concentrations in the “residue” after handpicking. The age of the blue ice from the K area {{was estimated to be}} 27 – 33 kyr before present based on oxygen isotope data. The estimated {{accretion rate}} to the whole Earth ranges from 5300 × 103 kg/a to 16000 × 103 kg/a. However, the lower end of this range probably represents lower limits due to possible loss of solar noble gases during long residence in the glacier ice. Hence, we estimate that the accretion rate of micrometeorites 27 – 33 kyr before present to be in the range between (11000 ± 6600) × 103 kg/a and (16000 ± 9100) × 103 kg/a.

40|$|Glaciers in the {{tropical}} Andes have been rapidly losing mass since the 1970 s. In addition to the documented increase in temperature, increases in light-absorbing particles deposited on glaciers could be contributing to the observed glacier loss. Here we report on measurements of light-absorbing particles sampled from glaciers during three surveys in the Cordillera Blanca Mountains in Peru. During three research expeditions in the dry seasons (May–August) of 2011, 2012 and 2013, 240 snow samples were collected from 15 mountain peaks over altitudes ranging from 4800 to nearly 6800 m. Several mountains were sampled each of the 3 years and some mountains were sampled multiple times during the same year. Collected snow samples were <b>melted</b> and <b>filtered</b> in the field then later analyzed using the Light Absorption Heating Method (LAHM), a new technique that measures the ability of particles on filters to absorb visible light. LAHM results have been calibrated using filters with known amounts of fullerene soot, a common industrial surrogate for black carbon (BC). As sample filters often contain dust in addition to BC, results are presented in terms of effective black carbon (eBC). During the 2013 survey, snow samples were collected and kept frozen for analysis with a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP 2). Calculated eBC mass from the LAHM analysis and the SP 2 refractory black carbon (rBC) results were well correlated (r 2 = 0. 92). These results indicate that {{a substantial portion of}} the light-absorbing particles in the more polluted regions were likely BC.

Preparation of Cells Culture cells on dishes or, preferably, coverslips (CS). Expose to radioisotopes, as required. Wash coverslips twice with PBS. Fix in methanol (or 95 % EtOH) on ice, for 15 minutes. Extract with 5 % TCA, on ice, for 30 minutes. Rinse twice with dH 2 O. Air dry. Mount coverslip (cell side up) on slide with drop of Permount. Allow to harden overnight. 2. Emulsion All procedures are done {{in a dark room}} with red light (use No. 2 red <b>filter).</b> <b>Melt</b> emulsion (KODAK NTB- 2 or NTB- 3) at 60 °C prior to use. Dilute 1 : 1 with dH 2 O. Add emulsion to dish and decant, leaving it on long enough to coat cells or dip slide into stock dilution. Do not mix used and unused emulsion. Drain for 1 minute to remove excess emulsion. Place in a dark box. Include desiccant and allow to sit for several days (as required) at room temperature or 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|Background: the ice of glaciers {{preserves}} pollen, bacteria, insect debris, {{dust and}} pollutants of human activity, {{and is an}} important reservoirs of microorganisms. This complex ecological system can originate from the biosphere of the around geographic area and from the particles and microorganisms transported by wind. Objectives: study the bacterial biodiversity, the presence of chemical contaminants of Madaccio Glacier in Italian Alps and to isolate bacteria with relevant biotechnology or bioremediation features. Methods: The ice-cores, collected at 3, 125 m of altitude, were sampled by drilling in aseptic conditions. The water of <b>melted</b> ice-core was <b>filtered</b> by 0. 2 µm membrane. Samples for microbiological analysis were recovered from filter membrane while water for chemical analysis. DGGE (Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) fingerprinting {{analysis was used to}} determine the microbial community present in ice. Plate counting was used to isolate viable microbial cultures. Conclusion: GC-Ms analysis on melted ice showed the presence of PCB congeners and PAH. DGGE and microbiological analysed demonstrated the presence of viable Bacteria and Archaea. with a majority of strain belonging to Protebacteria, Firmicutes and Actinomycetales. Among them a strain of Pseudomonas veronii able to metabolize at temperature close to 0 °C demonstrated the ability of degrading phenanthrene in pure culture and to growth a medium containing only this PAH as carbon source in minimal salt medium.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis reports an experimental investigation concerned with the optimisation of mechanical properties in investment cast LM 25 aluminium alloy. The effects of <b>melt</b> hydrogen content, <b>filter</b> usage, grain refinement, eutectic silicon modification, heat treatment, pouring and shell preheat temperatures on the structure and tensile properties of LM 25 investment cast tensile test specimens were studied. Four series of experiments were conducted to assess {{the effects of the}} parameters studied on the structure and tensile properties. The first series established the effect of melt hydrogen content, pouring temperature and shell preheat temperature on the casting porosity, pore morphology and tensile properties. The second series investigated the effect of using a ceramic foam filter on the tensile properties. Pouring temperature and shell preheat temperature were variable parameters {{in this part of the}} investigation. The objective of the third series of experiments was to investigate the effect of grain refinement and eutectic silicon modification on the structure and tensile properties. The interaction of these melt treatments with shell preheat temperature and filtration was also studied. In the final series of experiments the effect of heat treatment cycles on the samples produced in the third series of experiments was evaluated in terms of structure and tensile properties. The principal findings of the research were that: shell preheat temperature and hydrogen content are the most important process variables determining the total porosity content; shell temperature affects the structure and, hence, the tensile properties; grain refinement is enhanced as the titanium content increases to about 0. 28...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is the removal of inclusions from silicon scrap and metallurgical grade silicon. To reach this goal, two various routes are investigated. First, settling of SiC particles from molten silicon followed by directional solidification is reported in this thesis. Then, removal of SiC and Si 3 N 4 inclusions in silicon scrap by filtration with foam filters and wettabilities of silicon on graphite materials are studied. To supply the increasing needs of the photovoltaic industry {{it is necessary to}} produce a low cost silicon feedstock. One of the many routes established from the industry is the Solsilc project. This project aims to produce solar-grade silicon by carbothermal reduction of silicon, based on the use of very pure raw materials. The high carbon content of about 700 mass ppm of the silicon in the form of SiC particles, needs to be removed before the Solsilc silicon {{could be used as a}} feedstock to PV industry. Settling of SiC particles in molten silicon was investigated. This part of the work was in cooperation with SINTEF Materials & Chemistry. Two experiments were conducted and the cast silicon ingots were analyzed by light microscopy and LECO carbon analyzer. The results showed that the number of inclusions in the middle of the ingots was less than in the bottom and top. The removal efficiency was above 96 % in the middle part of an ingot and the total carbon content measured by LECO was < 25 mass ppm. The difference in density between the particles and the melt gives the SiC particles a relatively high settling velocity leading to a high removal efficiency. Pushing and engulfment of SiC particles by solidification front was also studied. Directional solidification of silicon that followed settling pushes the particles to the top of the ingot. The presence of SiC particles in the middle of the ingot is explained by engulfment. Top-cut silicon scrap represents a considerable loss of the PV silicon. Removal of inclusions from the silicon scrap would make it possible to recycle it to feedstock in the PV cell production. This was carried out by filtration with ceramic foam filters. Carbon and SiC foam filters with various pore sizes were employed in the filtration experiments. They were provided by Eger-Sørensen, a Norwegian company and Foseco AB in Sweden. The top-cut silicon scrap came from REC-Scan Wafer. Characterization of inclusions in silicon scrap before and after filtration experiments took place. Two techniques were developed and used in this work. First, extraction of inclusions by acid dissolution of the silicon was carried out. The SiC and Si 3 N 4 particles collected afterwards were analyzed and counted by automated light microscopy. In the second technique, silicon samples were ground and polished with diamond paste. Microscopic analysis consisted of measuring the surface area of the inclusions found in the silicon samples. Results show that inclusions in top-cut solar cell silicon scrap are needle-like Si 3 N 4 particles and round SiC inclusions. The removal efficiency for a 30 ppi SiC filter is more than 99 %. The inclusions remaining after filtration are mainly SiC particles smaller than 10 µm. The experiments show that the filtration efficiency increases with decreasing filter pore size. Some filter cakes that mainly consist of large Si 3 N 4 inclusions are found on the top surface of the filter. Deep bed filtration is the mechanism responsible for the removal of small particles. After taking into consideration various models for the foam filters the main conclusion is that interception seems to be the main removal mechanism of inclusions in silicon. Settling appears to play a minor role for our system. A new model named branch model explains better the experimental results. Due to the low wetting angle between molten metal and the filter material, capillary forces drive the <b>melt</b> through the <b>filter.</b> Therefore, the <b>melt</b> velocity through the filter is high. This justifies the usage of potential flow in the branch model.   It is shown that molten silicon may be contaminated in contact with the refractories. Since purity for solar cell silicon is crucial, contamination must be minimized. Graphite crucibles may be a source of relatively high levels of Al, Fe, and P. In the filtration process, wettability of the molten silicon with the filter material is very important. Thus, spreading and infiltration of molten silicon into the graphite substrates were also investigated in this thesis. Five different graphites were provided by Svenska Tanso AB. They are in use as refractories in the PV industry and vary from each other in porosity, density, and average pore size. The sessile drop technique is employed to study the wetting behavior of molten silicon on the graphite materials. The measured contact angles show that molten silicon does not initially wet carbon materials. However, due to the chemical reaction between Si and C, a SiC layer is formed in the interface between molten silicon and the graphite. Formation of this layer lowers the contact angles finally reaching equilibrium wetting angles of molten silicon with SiC materials. Spreading of molten silicon is affected not only by the reaction formed SiC layer, but also by the surface finish. The final contact angles, also called equilibrium contact angles, decrease with increasing surface roughness of the graphites. Infiltration of silicon into graphites is mainly related to the average pore size of graphite materials. Materials with large pores are penetrated deeper by the liquid silicon. Zero contact angles of the silicon with graphites are found in materials with both high surface roughness and large average pore size. These results indicate that graphites for use in the PV industry should have a small average pore size. The surface of the graphite in direct contact with silicon should be smooth (low roughness).            ...|$|R
