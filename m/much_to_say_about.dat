Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought.

25|$|Smullyan (1991, 2001) {{has argued}} forcefully that Tarski's undefinability theorem deserves {{much of the}} {{attention}} garnered by Gödel's incompleteness theorems. That the latter theorems have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., Lucas 1961) is less than evident. Tarski's theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski's theorem is more strikingly evident.|$|E
25|$|The Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian {{account of}} {{creation}} {{completed in the}} 12th century has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Ahriman and {{his role in the}} cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the yazads on one side and Ahriman with his devs on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the forces of evil through good thoughts, words and deeds.|$|E

However, they have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition.

500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how." ...|$|E

500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems {{to be willing to}} play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E

[...] Reviewer Sherley Anne Williams from Ms. defined the novel to be [...] "a startling and engrossing commentary on the complex actuality and continuing heritage of american slavery. Seattle Post-Intelligencer writer John Marshall claimed that Kindred is [...] "the perfect introduction to Butler’s work and perspectives for those not usually enamored of science fiction." [...] The Austin Chronicle writer Barbara Strickland declared Kindred to be [...] "a novel of psychological horror {{as it is a}} novel of science fiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cricket in the 1860s {{underwent}} {{an evolutionary}} phase with the legalisation of overarm bowling in June 1864 and Grace himself {{said it was}} [...] "no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period" [...] with the game in transition and [...] "it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned". Grace had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the state of the}} grounds in the 1860s and declared that Lord's [...] "was in a very unsatisfactory condition". He added that wickets at The Oval were always much better than at Lord's, where the clay in the soil handicapped the groundsmen. Writing in 1899, Grace recollected that he [...] "could go on to the pitch at Lord's and pick up a handful of small pieces of gravel"; a source of danger as a fast ball hitting one of those small stones would [...] "fly high in the air".|$|E

2500|$|While lecturing there Wintringham helped Levy {{write his}} book [...] {{described}} {{by some as}} a [...] "war pamphlet" [...] Guerrilla Warfare as a practical manual. It originated in the lectures given at Osterley Park, and had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> close quarters combat. This was published in mass market paperback in Britain and the U.S. and ran to several editions. [...] Levy advocated guerrilla warfare as a democratic means of combating fascism, frequently attacking the military establishment who overlooked the lessons born of such commanders as T. E. Lawrence and their experience in irregular war. [...] He also recounts some of his adventures as a guerrilla, such as the time he and his companions trapped cats' tails in mouse traps as a means of distracting sentries. [...] Wintringham said that Levy was the most effective communicator in Great Britain on the tactics of commando and guerrilla warfare. [...] His primary lecture subject was knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Anderson of MTV {{said that}} [...] "Eenie Meenie" [...] melds Sean Kingston's island-inflected dance-pop with Bieber's sweet tween R" [...] A {{reviewer}} of DJBooth said, [...] "The record’s crown jewel, of course, is the chorus, which will worm {{its way into}} your head {{whether you like it}} or not." [...] Although he called the song catchy, Chris Richards of The Washington Post said Kingston [...] "hogs the mike" [...] on the song. Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic wrote about the lyrics, on the album review, that those are [...] "disturbing", but at the same time [...] "unintentionally hilarious." [...] She also criticized the production: [...] "There's not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the kind of producer who thinks the use of the term 'shorty' with an elementary school gimmick is a good idea." [...] Luke O'Neil from The Boston Globe noted [...] "Sultry reggaeton is repackaged here for the tween set with Sean Kingston's 'Eenie Meenie.' Shorty' was never sung so literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{mainstream}} Christianity, the Holy Spirit {{is one of}} {{the three}} divine persons of the Holy Trinity who make up the single substance of God; that is, the Spirit is considered to act in concert with and share an essential nature with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus). The New Testament has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's presence was especially felt following the ascension of Christ, although not to the exclusion of an early presence as attested by the Old Testament and throughout the New Testament. The Christian theology of the Holy Spirit, or pneumatology, was the last piece of Trinitarian theology to be fully explored and developed, and there is thus greater theological diversity among Christian understandings of the Spirit than there is among understandings of the Son and the Father. Within Trinitarian theology, the Holy Spirit is usually referred to as the [...] "Third Person" [...] of the triune God—with the Father being the First Person and the Son the Second Person.|$|E

2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film an [...] "old-fashioned monster movie {{dressed up in}} trendy new threads", praising the special effects, [...] "nihilistic attitude" [...] and [...] "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, [...] "In the end, [...] not much {{different}} from all the marauding creature features that have come before it". Scott Foundas of LA Weekly was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the September 11 attacks in New York City and called it [...] "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in [...] "stealth" [...] attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of Don Siegel, George A. Romero and Steven Spielberg, saying, [...] "Where those filmmakers all had something meaningful to say {{about the state of the}} world and [...] human nature, Abrams doesn't have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> anything". Manohla Dargis in the New York Times called the allusions [...] "tacky", saying, [...] " [...] may make you think of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination", but that [...] "the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence". She concludes that the film [...] "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com calls the film [...] "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film [...] "takes the trauma of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune warned that the viewer may feel [...] "queasy" [...] at the references to September 11, but that [...] "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" [...] and that such tactics were [...] "crude, but undeniably gripping". He called the film [...] "dumb", but [...] "quick and dirty and effectively brusque", concluding that despite it being [...] "a harsher, more demographically calculating brand of fun", he enjoyed the film. Bruce Paterson of Cinephilia described the film as [...] "a successful experiment in style but not necessarily a successful story for those who want dramatic closure". [...] Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the Half-Life video game series, in particular the [...] "Ant-lion" [...] monsters from Half-Life 2, and the constant first-person perspective.|$|E
