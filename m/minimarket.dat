40|$|My thesis {{focused on}} the launch of new brand into {{commodity}} markets. Analysing the case study "Nestlé Coffee-mate launch into Czech and Slovak Republics" the thesis created the strategy of entering the market commonly valid for branded goods fighting the increasing power of the private labels. The main goal of the thesis was (not) to recommend Nestlé Česko, s. r. o. to enter Czech and Slovak markets. I made up particular marketing mix studying the commodity market of powdered coffee creamer category {{in connection with the}} consumer. Consequently I proposed communication strategy and communication mix. To verify the launch itself I used market test called <b>minimarkets.</b> <b>Minimarkets</b> actually took place at the end of 2008. The market test resulted into my recommendation not to launch Coffee-mate into Czech and Slovak Republic. Key indicators and expectations, so much important for the success of the launch iteself, have not been met during the testing. However, due to the methodologies selected within the thesis, the strategy how to enter the commodity market seems to be applicable onto different commodity categories. Therefore it may be used as a hint during a planning process for new competitive strategies of various brands defending themselves from the private labels...|$|R
