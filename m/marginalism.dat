25|$|Although {{the central}} concept of <b>{{marginal}}ism</b> {{is that of}} marginal utility, marginalists, {{following the lead of}} Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost. The neoclassical tradition that emerged from British <b>marginalism</b> abandoned the concept of utility and gave marginal rates of substitution a more fundamental role in analysis. <b>Marginalism</b> {{is an integral part of}} mainstream economic theory.|$|E
25|$|Demand curves are {{explained}} by <b>marginalism</b> {{in terms of}} marginal rates of substitution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marginalism</b> {{eventually}} found a foothold {{by way of}} the work of three economists, Jevons in England, Menger in Austria, and Walras in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Both neoclassical {{economics}} and thorough-going <b>marginalism</b> {{could be said}} to explain supply curves in terms of marginal cost; however, there are marked differences in conceptions of that cost.|$|E
25|$|It {{might also}} be noted that some {{followers}} of Henry George similarly consider <b>marginalism</b> and neoclassical economics a reaction to Progress and Poverty, which was published in 1879.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrines of}} <b>marginalism</b> and the Marginal Revolution are often {{interpreted}} {{as a response to}} the rise of the worker's movement, Marxian economics and the earlier (Ricardian) socialist theories of the exploitation of labour. The first volume of Das Kapital was not published until July 1867, when <b>marginalism</b> was already developing, but before the advent of Marxian economics, proto-marginalist ideas such as those of Gossen had largely fallen on deaf ears. It was only in the 1880s, when Marxism had come to the fore as the main economic theory of the workers' movement, that Gossen found (posthumous) recognition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marginalism</b> {{explains}} choice {{with the}} hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|Léon Walras {{introduced}} the theory in Éléments d'économie politique pure, {{the first part}} of which was published in 1874. (American John Bates Clark is also associated with the origins of <b>Marginalism,</b> but did little to advance the theory.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{theoretical}} {{contributions of the}} early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value, <b>marginalism</b> in price theory, and the formulation of the economic calculation problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marginalism</b> is {{a theory}} of {{economics}} that attempts to explain the discrepancy {{in the value of}} goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|The third {{step from}} {{political}} economy to economics was {{the introduction of}} <b>marginalism</b> and the proposition that economic actors made decisions based on margins. For example, a person decides to buy a second sandwich based on how full {{he or she is}} after the first one, a firm hires a new employee based on the expected increase in profits the employee will bring. This differs from the aggregate decision making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can be cheap, while luxuries can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a {{different}} 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the Long Depression and the resurgence of class conflict in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. <b>Marginalism,</b> Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory {{of the free market}} as perfect, as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.|$|E
25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of <b>Marginalism</b> begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market {{has been shown to}} be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Marginalism</b> assumes, for {{any given}} agent, {{economic}} rationality and an ordering of possible states-of-the-world, such that, {{for any given}} set of constraints, there is an attainable state which is best {{in the eyes of}} that agent. [...] Descriptive <b>marginalism</b> asserts that choice amongst the specific means by which various anticipated specific states-of-the-world (outcomes) might be affected is governed only by the distinctions amongst those specific outcomes; prescriptive <b>marginalism</b> asserts that such choice ought to be so governed.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly a later Marxist critic, Ernest Mandel, {{argued that}} <b>marginalism</b> was [...] "divorced from reality", ignored {{the role of}} production, and that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Whether utility or <b>marginalism</b> {{was more}} {{essential}} to this revolution (whether the noun or the adjective {{in the phrase}} [...] "marginal utility" [...] is more important) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his early}} {{response}} to <b>marginalism,</b> Nikolai Bukharin argued that [...] "the subjective evaluation from which price {{is to be}} derived really starts from this price", concluding: ...|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{it is not}} {{unreasonable}} to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems (1896),"On the Closure of the Marxist System"], Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für K. Knies (1896). but the first was Wicksteed's [...] "The Marxian Theory of Value. Das Kapital: a criticism" [...] (1884, followed by [...] "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" [...] in 1885). Initially {{there were only a few}} Marxist responses to <b>marginalism,</b> of which the most famous were Rudolf Hilferding's Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik (1904) and Politicheskoy ekonomni rante (1914) by Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin). However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between <b>marginalism</b> and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist Piero Sraffa providing an important critique of <b>marginalism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some economists {{strongly}} influenced by the Marxian tradition such as Oskar Lange, Włodzimierz Brus, and Michał Kalecki have attempted to integrate the insights of classical political economy, <b>marginalism,</b> and neoclassical economics. They believed that Marx lacked a sophisticated theory of prices, and neoclassical economics lacked a theory of the social frameworks of economic activity. [...] Some other Marxists have also argued that on one level there is no conflict between <b>marginalism</b> and Marxism: one could employ a marginalist theory {{of supply and demand}} {{within the context of a}} “big picture” understanding of the Marxist notion that capitalists exploit labor.|$|E
2500|$|A thorough-going <b>{{marginal}}ism</b> sees {{marginal cost}} as increasing under the [...] "law" [...] of diminishing marginal utility, because applying resources to one application reduces their availability to other applications. [...] Neoclassical economics tends to disregard this argument, {{but to see}} marginal costs as increasing in consequence of diminishing returns.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Marx {{died before}} <b>marginalism</b> became the {{interpretation}} of economic value accepted by mainstream economics. [...] His theory {{was based on the}} labor theory of value, which distinguishes between exchange value and use value. In his Capital he rejected the explanation of long-term market values by supply and demand: ...|$|E
2500|$|A more thorough-going <b>marginalism</b> {{represents}} the supply curve as a complementary demand curvenbsp&– [...] where {{the demand is}} for money and the purchase is made with a good or service. [...] The shape of that curve is then determined by marginal rates of substitution of money for that good or service.|$|E
2500|$|In microeconomics, {{principal}} concepts include {{supply and}} demand, <b>marginalism,</b> rational choice theory, opportunity cost, budget constraints, utility, {{and the theory}} of the firm. • [...] Early macroeconomic models focused on modeling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including new Keynesians, reformulated their models in microfoundations.|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Dobb {{argued that}} prices derived through <b>marginalism</b> {{depend on the}} {{distribution}} of income. [...] The ability of consumers to express their preferences is dependent on their spending power. [...] As the theory asserts that prices arise in the act of exchange, Dobb argues that it cannot explain how the distribution of income affects prices and consequently cannot explain prices.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Marginalism</b> and neoclassical {{economics}} typically explain {{price formation}} broadly through {{the interaction of}} curves or schedules of supply and demand. [...] In any case buyers are modelled as pursuing typically lower quantities, and sellers offering typically higher quantities, as price is increased, with each being willing to trade until the marginal value of what they would trade-away exceeds that of the thing for which they would trade.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Marginalism</b> as {{a formal}} theory can be {{attributed}} to the work of three economists, Jevons in England, Menger in Austria, and Walras in Switzerland. William Stanley Jevons first proposed the theory in articles in 1863 and 1871. Similarly, Carl Menger presented the theory in 1871. [...] Menger explained why individuals use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs, but while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.|$|E
2500|$|Dobb {{also criticized}} the motives behind {{marginal}} utility theory. [...] Jevons wrote, for example, [...] "so far as {{is consistent with}} the inequality of wealth in every community, all commodities are distributed by exchange so as to produce the maximum social benefit." [...] (See [...] Fundamental theorems of welfare economics.) Dobb contended that this statement indicated that <b>marginalism</b> is intended to insulate market economics from criticism by making prices the natural result of the given income distribution.|$|E
2500|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} usually {{assumes that}} marginal changes are infinitesimals or limits. (Though this assumption makes the analysis less robust, it increases tractability.) One is therefore often told that [...] "marginal" [...] {{is synonymous with}} [...] "very small", though in more general analysis {{this may not be}} operationally true (and would not in any case be literally true). [...] Frequently, economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a resource, because decisions are often made in terms of units; <b>marginalism</b> seeks to explain unit prices in terms of such marginal values.|$|E
2500|$|Wieser also {{developed}} a monetary theory. It {{was inspired by the}} research of Carl Menger, in particular by his study of currency, which discussed both the historical evolution of money and the theory of its value. Wieser used the theory of marginal utility as a basis for his monetary theory. It was initially rejected; in fact, some authors tried to prove that <b>marginalism</b> [...] necessarily failed when used as a basis for building such theories. However, his disciple, Ludwig von Mises, studied Wieser's theory and fleshed it out, creating the complex upon which he built the German concept of [...] (money).|$|E
2500|$|The school {{originated}} in Vienna, in the Austrian Empire. Carl Menger's 1871 book, Principles of Economics, {{is generally considered}} {{the founding of the}} Austrian School. The book {{was one of the first}} modern treatises to advance the theory of marginal utility. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics. While <b>marginalism</b> was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the [...] "Psychological School", [...] "Vienna School", or [...] "Austrian School".|$|E
2500|$|Böhm-Bawerk's Positive Theory of Capital (1889), {{offered as}} the second volume of Capital and Interest, {{elaborated}} on the economy's time-consuming production processes and of the interest payments they entail. Further Essays on Capital and Interest (1921) was the third volume, which originally started as appendices to the second volume. Book III (part of the second volume), Value and Price, developed Menger's ideas of marginal utility outlined in his Principles of Economics, to develop the idea of subjective value as related to <b>marginalism,</b> in that things only have value insofar as such people want such goods. To illustrate the principle, Böhm-Bawerk used a practical example of a farmer who was left with five sacks of corn after harvest to provide for his needs until the next harvest: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrines of}} <b>marginalism</b> and the Marginal Revolution are often {{interpreted}} as somehow {{a response to}} Marxist economics. However {{the first volume of}} Das Kapital was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, Hayek or Bartley has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the British Museum, may have come across the works of {{one or more of these}} figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of Kapital before his death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 20th century {{mainstream}} economics, {{the term}} [...] "utility" [...] {{has come to}} be formally defined as a quantification capturing preferences by assigning greater quantities to states, goods, services, or applications that are of higher priority. [...] But <b>marginalism</b> and the concept of marginal utility predate the establishment of this convention within economics. [...] The more general conception of utility is that of use or usefulness, and this conception {{is at the heart of}} marginalism; the term [...] "marginal utility" [...] arose from translation of the German [...] "Grenznutzen",Natural Value] (1889), Bk I Ch V [...] "Marginal Utility" [...] (...) [...] which literally means border use, referring directly to the marginal use, and the more general formulations of marginal utility do not treat quantification as an essential feature. [...] On the other hand, none of the early marginalists insisted that utility were not quantified, some indeed treated quantification as an essential feature, and those who did not still used an assumption of quantification for expository purposes. [...] In this context, it is not surprising to find many presentations that fail to recognize a more general approach.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marginalism</b> {{refers to}} the study of {{marginal}} theories and studies within economics. The topics included in <b>marginalism</b> are marginal utility, marginal gain, marginal rates of substitution, and opportunity costs. <b>Marginalism</b> {{can be applied to the}} subjective theory of value because the subjective theory takes into account the marginal utility of an item in order to put a value on it.|$|E
