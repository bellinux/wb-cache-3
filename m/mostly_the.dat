The highway then ran through Lawton—concurring with {{the original}} SH-29—en route to Anadarko via Apache. In Anadarko, SH-8 linked up with the present highway.

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking <b>mostly</b> <b>the</b> former and adults <b>mostly</b> <b>the</b> latter. It hunts most actively {{at dawn and}} dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E

It is of note that the northeastern divide of the Snake River watershed forms the Idaho-Montana boundary, so the Snake River watershed does not extend into Montana.|$|E

There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E

Modern scholarship has not been successful in determining how much of the play each of the collaborators wrote, but the Verne scholar Robert Pourvoyeur has suggested that the play is clearly founded on Verne's ideas and therefore can be treated as being <b>mostly</b> <b>the</b> work of Verne.|$|E

The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is <b>mostly</b> <b>the</b> speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes.
