40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} three European macro-regions: the Baltic Sea Region (BSR), the –revamped- Benelux, and the Danube Region (DR). It makes a {{comparative}} {{analysis of these}} three schemes of regional integration within (and in some cases beyond) the EU. The paper discusses literature on differentiated integration as well as literature on (old and new) regionalism and territorial governance. It develops an analytical framework which involves various aspects of differentiation/regionalization: time, matter, drivers for differentiation and /or regionalization, membership, institutions, decision-making, and modes of governance. Through desk-research (policy documents, websites, and earlier research) the framework {{is applied to the}} three macro-regions at hand. The analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> for the BSR and DR are almost identical, that the Benelux is different from the other two macro-regions, but that there also is some convergence, with the Benelux becoming more open and process-oriented, and the BSR and DR being effectively institutionalized by the EU.

Macro-regional strategies of the European Union are conceived as new instruments for territorial cooperation.

These strategies are expected to articulate functional and political complexity and to improve policy e 9 ciency through cooperative and flexible approaches, without creating new institution or funding. In {{the framework of the}} Western Mediterranean macro-region, we can wonder for instance whether two existing euroregions in this area – Euroregion Pyrénées-Méditerranée and Euroregion Alpes-Méditerranée – can be milestones in the constitution of a <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategy</b> for this area.

40|$|Macro-regions' are an {{established}} concept in {{economic and political}} geography, {{as well as in}} spatial planning (Smith et al., 2002; Pain and van Hamme, 2014). As such, they are widely applied in a range of contexts. However, following the adoption of EU <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), the Danube Region (EUSDR) and the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR), as well as an agreement in the European Council for a strategy to be developed for the Alpine Region (EUSALP), the concept of macro-regions has gained increased prominence in contemporary policy practice and debates. Under EU Cohesion Policy, a 'macro-regional strategy' is defined as 'an integrated framework endorsed by the European Council, which may be supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds among others, to address common challenges faced by a defined geographical area relating to Member States and third countries located in the same geographical area which thereby benefit from strengthened cooperation contributing to achievement of economic, social and territorial cohesion' (CEC DG Regio, 2014).

40|$|Macro-regions have {{recently}} gained {{importance in the}} EU policy debate following the promotion of <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> {{as one of the}} key tools of European integration and increased territorial cohesion. They are perceived as a means of improving the coordination between, and thus the effectiveness of, various policies delivered in respective area. This paper is trying to argue that in order to achieve better coordination in dealing with territorial development in macro-regions and thus also added value from <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies,</b> territorial coordination should be pursued, focusing on functional aspects and informal processes of mutual learning and adaptations of goals between the actors involved. To support this position the paper elaborates and emphasizes a distinction between territorial coordination and territorial governance, where coordination is seen as a product of decentralised control over resources, processes and activities, whereas governance refers to deliberate transcending of the borders of government, while retaining some degree of centralised control. Towards the end it suggests that appropriate tools for territorial coordination are needed, including at least working groups for tackling specific transnational and cross-border planning problems as well as area-wide platforms for exchanging information and knowledge that would allow for continuity and transparency needed for the construction of collective knowledge in the area...|$|R

As the first EU <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategy,</b> the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) is an interesting and important case for studying actors’ participation opportunities in multi-level governance arrangements. This thesis undertakes to identify factors that are favourable for an actor’s opportunity to participate, by studying {{the case of the}} EUSBSR. The findings serve to open up discussions concerning equal opportunities to participate, which is fundamental for legitimacy. It is concluded that there is a strong overrepresentation of national governmental actors, and it is their strong position in society {{that seems to be the}} favourable factor for their opportunity to participate. Furthermore, experience, in addition to expertise, also appears to be a favourable factor. Yet, it seems crucial that an actor perceives itself as affected, and especially by the issue, if it is to participate at all.

40|$|With {{the decline}} of the nation state and the {{increasing}} importance of regionalisation, the EU has launched macro-regions, i. e., areas, including territories from several countries, that share common goals and operating under multi-level governance. This paper focuses on the EU territorial cooperation strategy, utilising the concept of „macro- -region” and the perspective of the macro-regional approach. Following the first macro-regions (such as the Baltic Sea Region and the Danube Region), the EU recently launched the Adriatic-Ionian <b>Macro-regional</b> <b>Strategy,</b> which was seen as an additional tool for cooperation between local and regional authorities that overlooks the Adriatic Sea. Nevertheless, future developments in the region appear at the present to be quite uncertain, owing to structural industrial decline, rural marginalisation and a lack of infrastructure adequate to support the entire cooperation area. To overcome these constraints, the concept of macro-region must be strengthened by creating alternative ways to engage in cross-border cooperation between areas subject to similar conditions. Matching among regions that belong to different Euro-countries within the framework of a macro- -region may {{be the best way to}} forge a consistent path towards territorial, economic and social integration. This will help to create a common pole of cooperation characterized by various strategies that can act as accelerators in creating territorial capita...|$|E

However, macro-regional strategies conceived to aid European integration and territorial cohesion were viewed by academics with skepticism, obscuring the strategies’ potential impact. This thesis intends to investigate and measure the added value of the EUSBSR in order to analyze its impact on regional development and its feasibility {{as a guide for}} future programs intending to strengthen European cohesion and integration. To determine the added value of the EUSBSR the thesis is organized into three sections, so as to address environmental, social, and economic concerns, respectively.

To figure the added cooperation that academic cooperation among universities would contribute to social dimension, the work has chosen several study results.

The process of regional integration has implied that a broader scope of themes is included in EU transnational cooperation. The macro-regional approach includes several types of actors, state and non-state, public and private all of whom are equally interested in the process of regional integration and cooperation. Macro-regional cooperation can be based on heterogeneous structures where shared challenges are the common denominator. In brief, macro-regional strategies may be seen as a tool of European integration and increased territorial cohesion. A certain amount of added-value can be foreseen from {{the development and implementation of}} macro-regional strategies. The message from the Commission that work must take place within the existing structural framework as regards the development and application of the strategy, moreover, implies that three fundamental questions must be posed in order to develop a successful strategy.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the novel governance approach underpinning the European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR). The EUSBSR {{was launched in}} the summer of 2009 and is the first, but perhaps not the last, <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategy</b> developed by the EU. The strategy does not supply any new instruments, legislation or funding. Instead it collects and highlights diverse and often already existing initiatives and instruments within a Baltic Sea Region framing, adding a macro-regional perspective. In the paper, concepts borrowed from Actor-Network Theory (ANT) are utilized to help us better understand the governance approach behind the strategy. It is argued that the practice of constructing the EUSBSR can be understood as an example of heterogeneous engineering, a performative attempt to assemble a macro-regional collective through translations of interests in processes of problematization, engagement/interessement, enrolment and mobilization. By formulating common matters of concern the idea of common interests is introduced and established. Moreover, the collective that is being assembled in the strategy is clearly hybrid in nature as the strategy attempts to speak for and represent not only the interests of EU member states, but also of entities as diverse as plankton, small businesses and tourists. The paper further discusses the relationship between the governance approach of the EUSBSR and collaborative planning methodology. It is argued that although some aspects of the EUSBSR governance approach are reminiscent of a collaborative approach, the divergences are fundamental...|$|E
40|$|The EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) {{that was}} {{launched}} by the European Union in 2009 as its first <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategy.</b> The objective of Policy Area Innovation (PA-INNO) within the EUSBSR, is to promote a globally competitive position within research and innovation for growth in the Baltic Sea Region. Following the inclusion of Priority area "SME" {{and part of the}} Priority area "Internal Market" as well as the horizontal action "Promo" into Policy Area Innovation (PA-INNO), it was necessary to promote and operationalise the EUSBSR strategy for Policy Area Innovation.

40|$|Historically, {{cooperation}} {{across borders}} was {{an area of}} activity dominated by central government actors. However, in the EU {{some of the earliest}} institutionalised forms of territorial cooperation are based on bottom-up initiatives involving border municipalities. Current territorial cooperation arrangements continue to be strongly based upon local and regional institutions and actors. Theoretical work on Europeanisation, multi-level governance and new regionalism highlights the increased role of sub-national actors in driving economic development and participating in external networking and cooperation activities. However, the scope and diversity of programmes mean that the opportunities for local and regional partners in terms of influencing the outcomes of programmes are equally varied. There have been significant differences in governance dimensions of programmes. Key questions this paper explores are to what extent bottom-up or top-down approaches are used as well as differences in terms of centralised or localised management or implementation structures. The first part of this paper explores which actors influence key processes in the territorial cooperation cycle at which stage and how these can vary across programmes in order to assess the existence of governance dimensions. The second part of the paper builds on the first section and will specifically focus on the impact that <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> have had and can expected to have in the future. These strategies have the potential to significantly affect established territorial cooperation programmes (such as INTERREG). However, its full implications are not fully understood. This section will also explore how these <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> may lead to changes in governance approaches and {{have an impact on the}} types of partners that European territorial cooperation attracts.

40|$|This book looks both {{backward}} and forward {{with regard to}} the European Union’s political strategies towards its neighbouring countries. By bringing together the perspectives of critical geopolitics, policy studies and border studies, it presents a comprehensive review of the European Neighbourhood Policy and how it impacts the ongoing construction of the EU’s external frontiers. Is the EU committed to promoting integration in a ‘wider’ European space, or is a “fortress Europe” emerging where the strengthening of internal cohesion is coupled with the militarisation of its external borders? The book aims to problematize this question by showing how the EU’s external policies are based on a mixture of openness and closure, inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and securitisation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a controversial strategy where regionalization and bordering, homogenisations and differentiations, centrifugal and centripetal forces proceed side-by-side, in an explicit attempt to construct a selective, mobile and fragmented border. A specific focus is devoted to the diversity of geo-strategies the EU is pursuing in its neighbouring countries and regions, <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> and cross-border cooperation initiatives as new scales of cooperation, and the role of other global players...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} the result of an effort made by the authors to explore the needs of {{education}} and training in the field of local development, according to the situation in Romanian and Bulgarian Danube bordering regions, aiming at designing joint projects to address such needs between the universities to which authors are affiliated. Local development is here understood as a deliberately induced process of improving the welfare of local communities, which should be democratic, inclusive and sustainable, in particular with regard to creating competitive local economies, stimulating economic growth and ensuring better living conditions for the inhabitants. Local development {{is an important part of}} a governance process which involves complex interactions at various territorially defined levels: local, regional, national, cross-national, international. In the case of the regions considered in the present paper a historical opportunity is provided for them by the so called European Union Strategy for the Danube Region. In order to fully exploit this opportunity, the capacity to address local development issues should be strengthened in both countries, especially by well designed education and training programmes. This is why local development was considered a priority topic for the cooperation between the two universities. In the same framework, taking into consideration the challenges which are specific to the Lower Danube Region, other topics of interest were considered: logistics, tourism, consumer affairs or rural development. The authors of the present paper had to avoid overlapping with the work of the other teams. In particular, there are many common points between local development and rural development, because in both countries the regions on the border of Danube are predominately rural and significantly dependent on agriculture. Therefore, here, the needs for education and training are defined in strict correlation with the required capacity for understanding the development process and its priorities, designing, planning, implementing and assessing development policies with a favourable local impact in a regional context. The paper presents as in a mirror the Romanian and the Bulgarian points of view. The two perspectives are quite different but complementary. Briefly said, while the Romanian approach is bottom-up, with a focus on the local capacity to take initiatives that will contribute at shaping the regional development process, the Bulgarian one considers first the priorities of the region, in order to define the capacities required for a proper response at AE Education and Training Needs in the Field of Local Development in the Lower Danube Macro Region local level. Both perspectives are valid, and it should not be any contradiction between them. This is why we consider they are complementary. The studies rely on documentary research and secondary analysis of data in order to assess the capacity gap in addressing local development issues, and to identify education and training needs in economics and business matters related to local development. They discuss the rationale of cooperation between universities from Bulgaria and Romania in responding to such needs, and, finally they propose an inventory of joint initiatives in this respect. The paper emphasizes the factors which explain the reasons why cooperation between universities in raising the expertise in local development maters on both sides of Lower Danube is required and desirable, such as the vicinity, the common opportunities and responsibilities related to having Danube as a common asset, the similarities in development patterns, the common challenge of European integration, use of EU support and better exploitation of the Internal Market, the need to speed up the modernisation process and to achieve some economies of scope and scale. Among other proposals, authors propose the establishment of a university hub to coordinate networking among higher education institutions from Bulgaria, Romania and other countries of the Danube Macro-region in the field of local and regional development related research, education and training and a joint master program in local development. local development; education and training; Danube Region, cross-border cooperation; <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|E

Specific emphasis is put on the innovative features of the macro-regional concept in relation to regionalism, multi-level and a wider EU perspective. With the EUSBSR as a case, it is argued that the macro-region is a new forum of cooperation, which cuts across different policy sectors and levels. The macro-region is based on functional cooperation and is characterised by a unique mode of governance, which is bottom-oriented with its involvement of regional stakeholders, and opens up for a leading role to the Member States in the implementation phase.

40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, {{publications}} within the ‘‘new regional geography’’ have given little emphasis to cartography. This paper examines the specific role of mapping, its political stakes and modalities, in the region-building process. It illustrates this with an analysis of mapping and database production in the institutionalization process of two ‘‘project regions’’— the Alps and Carpathian mountains — and in two related, on-going efforts to promote <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies.</b> This paper argues that the production of maps and databases deserves to be seen {{not only as a}} technical moment, or simply as one output among others in the region-building process, but rather as a component of the process itself, a component that is especially decisive and complex in that it makes explicit the connection between the territorial and the relational dimensions of region-making. The two cases illustrate that mapping is a significant component of the region-making process for three main reasons: (1) it gives shape to the region, provides arguments for its construction, and therefore is a decisive cognitive and rhetorical tool for territorialization; (2) it contributes to the shaping of relational arrangements for the corresponding region; (3) its contribution is important at all different stages in the region-making process – conceptualization, creation, and consolidation – through various modalitie...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} one million years the land area of Europe was at times 40 % larger than at present, and was usually 10 - 20 % larger because of the global volumes of water locked up in ice-caps several {{kilometres}} thick on land.

Early tribes migrated from Africa through the Middle East, and then along the Mediterranean shore, as well as through central Europe, occupying northern territories when the ice melted and retreating southward when the ice expanded. These migrations across continental shelves, including the abandonment and re-occupation of ancient coastal plains, took place many times. Continental Shelf Prehistoric Research is a new integrated discipline linking the analysis of climate change, sea-level change, environmental conditions, and the prehistoric archaeology of peoples who lived on and migrated across the continental shelf, land now submerged beneath the sea. It requires collaboration between experts in the humanities and earth sciences, as well as collaboration with offshore industries such as hydrocarbons, wind farm installations, fishing, dredging, and channel maintenance. Modern technology in seabed acoustic survey, data acquisition, diving technology, data storage and predictive modelling make it feasible to envisage a proactive strategy which would have been impossible 10 - 20 years ago. Costs can be kept to a minimum by combining the initial surveys needed for Continental Shelf Prehistoric Research with those already being conducted for environmental impact assessment and national and regional environmental monitoring requirements. Europe leads the world in this research and it is imperative to consolidate and expand this advantage. The variable and partial traces of early humans found on land cannot be fully understood unless we can study and include the large proportion of data on the sea floor. Submerged sites include those that demonstrate the earliest stages of seafaring and exploitation of marine resources. Already more than 2, 500 submerged prehistoric sites have been found and catalogued in the European seas mostly dating from 5, 000 - 20, 000 years old, with a few in the range of 20, 000 to 350, 000 years old. Organic materials such as wooden huts, canoes, paddles, rope, string, charcoal, and fish-traps that are found underwater are seldom found in dry-land sites of the same age. Several refereed books and articles on this topic have been published in recent years, and the number is growing exponentially. A vigorous community of researchers in this field has been established and the field has gained significant momentum which needs to be further developed. Public interest in the subject has been generated through TV programmes and frequent articles in the popular press. Additional discoveries on the seabed will provide new potential for museums and regional exhibits in coastal cities and tourist regions. As a substantial part of the European cultural heritage, seabed prehistory is covered by treaties and international agreements. Promoting this research at the scale of the European sea basins supports the objectives of the European Integrated Maritime Policy and its environmental pillar, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Through the development of <b>macro-regional</b> <b>strategies</b> (e. g. for the Baltic, Adriatic and Ionian Seas, and Europe’s Atlantic margin) the European Union has identified Europe’s sea basins as the most appropriate geographical scale for managing Europe’s marine territories and resources. In addition, this paper illustrates the importance of industry cooperation in the protection of maritime cultural heritage. Hence, the importance of aligning Continental Shelf Prehistoric Research with the EU’s Blue Growth agenda, while perhaps not initially obvious, becomes clear on further analysis. The Integrated Maritime Policy also places the use of common approaches to the implementation of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) amongst EU Member and Associated States as a high priority. Already several coastal states have included seabed prehistoric site management in their MSP frameworks. By including in MSP seabed prehistoric sites and other submerged archaeological objects such as shipwrecks, offshore operators are saved the uncertainty that arises from discovery of sites when work has started and in this way management of cultural heritage resources becomes more efficient. But there are many challenges to achieving effective management and research of submerged prehistoric sites. Problems include the lack of recognition of the subject in archaeological training and university courses; damage to sites through natural erosion and climate change; industrial disturbance; the difficulty of integrating or accessing data across disciplinary boundaries or obtaining data of commercial origin; the lack of standards for best practice; few multi-national projects across state boundaries; the lack of specialized software for converting seabed acoustic data to reconstructions of terrestrial landscapes; the difficulty of creating a systematic understanding of the geoarchaeological processes that determine site survival; and the great range of different seabed environments in the different regional seas of Europe, ranging from rocky cliff or sediment-rich coasts, through enclosed sea basins and low-sediment rocky coasts in almost tideless clear waters. Critically, the protection of seabed prehistoric sites as cultural heritage is recognized by most coastal states, but the procedures for identification, assessment, survey, abandonment, protection, or excavation are still experimental and not fully developed. With respect to education and training, a few universities provide courses in which the subject is included, but seldom at an intensive level. Despite significant recent advances in marine survey and observation technologies, the demands of the new discipline for very high resolution acoustic data over wide areas create unusual requirements even by commercial standards. By working with industry, integrating data management with existing European projects, and improving accessibility to data, these problems can be significantly reduced. New technologies are specifically needed to confirm site existence within areas of high potential, possibly involving geochemical or other innovative techniques. A questionnaire survey of European national heritage agencies conducted by the working group in the process of producing this paper has established a list of archaeological objectives which are rated as the most important. Maintaining the momentum that has already been developed in this field will require multi-national collaboration supported by both national and European funding and policy. National agencies and the small number of universities currently involved cannot support the scale of activity that is required, or ensure compliance with existing treaties and legislation. The EU Horizon 2020 programme and the Joint Programming Initiatives are key programmes that are well placed to support the scale of collaborative research necessary to address the research goals outlined in the paper. In addition, the costs of ship time and advanced oceanographic technology can be optimized by collaboration between marine research agencies, industry, and the archaeological institutions. Continental Shelf Prehistoric Research needs to build on the experience and momentum of the COST Action, SPLASHCOS, to improve communication and collaboration between a growing community of scholars and to offer European experience and services globally. It is clear that despite the major progress that has been made in this broad and interactive research field, there is still much to be done to ensure that Europe’s submerged prehistoric cultural heritage is managed in an optimal way taking account of the needs of many stakeholders. The publication of this European Marine Board position paper provides a status report and needs assessment, which should help both research funders, the research community and policy makers {{to gain a better understanding}} of the challenges and opportunities we face in the next decade and beyond...|$|R
