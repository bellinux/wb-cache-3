40|$|International audienceMacaronesia (north-east Atlantic archipelagos) {{has been}} host to complex {{patterns}} of colonization and differentiation in many groups of organisms including seabirds such as gadfly petrels (genus Pterodroma). Considering the subspecies of widely distributed soft-plumaged petrel for many years, the taxonomic {{status of the}} three gadfly petrel taxa breeding in Macaronesia is not yet settled, some authors advocating the presence of three, two or one species. These birds have already {{been the subject of}} genetic studies with only one mtDNA gene and relatively modest sample sizes. In this study, using a total of five genes (two mitochondrial genes and three nuclear introns), we investigated the population and phylogeographical histories of petrel populations breeding on Madeira and Cape Verde archipelagos. Despite confirming complete lineage sorting with mtDNA, analyses with nucDNA failed to reveal any population structuring and Isolation with Migration analysis revealed the absence of gene flow during the differentiation process of these populations. It appears that the three populations diverged in the late Pleistocene in the last 150 000 years, that is 10 times more recently than previous estimates based solely on one mtDNA gene. Finally, our results suggest that the <b>Madeira</b> <b>petrel</b> population is ancestral rather than that from Cape Verde. This study strongly advocates the use of nuclear loci in addition to mtDNA in demographical and phylogeographical history studies...|$|E
5000|$|The Desertas petrel (Pterodroma deserta) {{is a small}} seabird in the gadfly petrel genus which breeds on Bugio Island in the Desertas off <b>Madeira.</b> The gadfly <b>petrels</b> in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance have caused the taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. [...] Although the systematics on this species {{has not yet been}} definitively established, provisionally some authorities have split the Desertas petrel, separating the Desertas breeding birds from those in the Cape Verde archipelago, while others consider it a subspecies of the Fea's petrel. The species is named after its breeding grounds, which are pronounced [...] "Dez-ERT-ass".|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} status and taxonomy {{of the three}} gadfly petrels that breed in Macaronesia is still discussed {{partly due to the}} scarce information on their spatial ecology. Using geolocator and capture-mark-recapture data, we examined phenology, natal philopatry and breeding-site fidelity, year-round distribution, habitat usage and at-sea activity of the three closely-related gadfly petrels that breed in Macaronesia: Zinoâ€™s <b>petrel</b> Pterodroma <b>madeira,</b> Desertas <b>petrel</b> P. deserta and Cape Verde petrel P. feae. All P. feae remained around the breeding area during their non-breeding season, whereas P. madeira and P. deserta dispersed far from their colony, migrating either to the Cape Verde region, further south to equatorial waters in the central Atlantic, or to the Brazil Current. The three taxa displayed a clear allochrony in timing of breeding. Habitat modelling and at-sea activity patterns highlighted similar environmental preferences and foraging behaviours of the three taxa. Finally, no chick or adult was recaptured away from its natal site and survival estimates were relatively high at all study sites, indicating strong philopatry and breeding-site fidelity for the three taxa. The combination of high philopatry, marked breeding asynchrony and substantial spatio-temporal segregation of their year-round distribution suggest very limited gene flow among the three taxa...|$|R
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's <b>petrel</b> on <b>Madeira</b> and Fea's <b>petrel</b> on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|R
500|$|The Zino's petrel or freira (Pterodroma madeira) {{is a small}} seabird in the gadfly petrel genus {{which is}} endemic to the island of <b>Madeira.</b> This long-winged <b>petrel</b> has a grey back and wings, with a dark [...] "W" [...] marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a {{triangle}} of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger Fea's petrel, and separating these two Macaronesian species at sea is very challenging. Zino's was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to species status because of differences in morphology, calls, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA. It is Europe's most endangered seabird, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira.|$|R
