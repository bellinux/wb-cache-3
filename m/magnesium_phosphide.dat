Reactivity studies on both the lead, and the analogous tin systems, showed that they could be used as precursors to generate examples of very rare two-coordinate group 14 metal cation complexes, including the first example of a β-diketiminate two-coordinate lead(II) cation, and an analogous example of a rare low-coordinate tin(II) system. These were studied in detail by computational methods, including the stabilising effects of a coordinated solvent molecule on the metal centre. β-Diketiminate magnesium alkyl complexes were generated to investigate the + 2 oxidation state metal environment without the presence of a stereochemically active lone pair, as present in the group 14 metal(II) complexes.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{optimized}} {{a device that}} performs the dried agricultural products disinfestation by fumigation process with phosphine gas. Moreover, it allows to completely exhaust the active principle contained in the pellets of <b>magnesium</b> and aluminium <b>phosphide</b> used in the fumigation process, and to complete the phosphine production process, ordinarily of 5 days, in 2 days. Further, the device results particularly convenient during the fumigation process performed in cold periods; in facts, it {{is equipped with a}} pellets heating device that improves the phosphine production. Further it allows the continuous remixing of the pellets during the fumigation process and the control of the humidity by mean of water injection. The prototype is composed of : - cylindrical tray in stainless steel, containing the pellets of <b>magnesium</b> and aluminium <b>phosphide,</b> and it is connected to an electrical heater with a thermostatic device for the tray temperature control; - electric engine for the rotation of the cylindrical tray; - two bars that sustain 5 harmonic steel sheets with the extremity folded up downward with an angle of 90 °. Such sheets, thanks to their elasticity, follow the fund of the tray. Besides they are of different length, so that they allow a good remixing. By mean ANSYS code it has been possible also to evaluate the goodness of the performed remixing. - a water sprinkler connected to an electrical valve that performs the environmental hygrometric control. In such way the value of the environmental humidity is kept optimal to have the maximum phosphine production and therefore the considered process results very fast. In the definition of the device geometries it has been used a 3 D CAD program: Solid Works. It has allowed to define a parametric model of the considered device. Some experimental tests have been performed to determine the amount of water flow to obtain the optimal humidity value and to avoid dangers of fires caused by the pellets, sprinkling a water quantity ranged from 1 / 40 to 10 ml for every ¼ of round of the cylindrical tray. Moreover some tests have been performed to determine the optimal heating temperature considering 4 different temperatures: 30, 40, 50, 60 °C, and evaluating the phosphine quantity produced in such conditions. Besides the process of remixing has been optimized, performed by the steel sheets opportunely shaped.

40|$|Abstract: Storage insect pests, {{microbial}} deterioration, and mycotoxins {{are major}} threats to dried fruit. Methyl bromide (MeBr) was the fumigant {{used to control}} pests until it was banned. The present study compared the use of MeBr (60 g m− 3 for 24 h) and alternatives—magnesium phosphide (1 and 2 g of phosphine (PH 3) per ton of dried fig for 5 days), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) at atmospheric pressure (in gas tight cubes for 5 days) and high pressure (2 h in pressurized tanks at 25 bars) —in controlling major pests (Ephestia cautella (Zell.) and Carpoglyphus lactis) of dried fig and in respect to dried fig quality. Fruit quality was investigated before exposure and after 2 months of storage at ambient conditions by analyzing moisture content, water activity, surface color, firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, and sugaring index. The effect on fruit surface was examined under a scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} tested methods effectively controlled storage pests without any major adverse effects on quality, and each had an advantage for the implementation stage. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>phosphide</b> treatment of 1 g t− 1 for 5 days is recommended due to its low investment and operational costs, CO 2 in pressurized tanks is recommended due to its short exposure period, and CO 2 under atmospheric pressure in gas-tight cubes is recommended due to its low cost and suitability for organic production.

40|$|The {{resistance}} testing kit is an assay {{to receive}} very quickly {{detailed information about}} the behaviour of adult insects in a phosphine atmosphere. The used concentration of 3, 000 ppm has a narcotic effect on non-resistant insects within a few minutes. Insects with a low phosphine susceptibility are still active after this time period. Using the resistance testing kit we succeed {{to distinguish between the}} tolerance of different insect species, the tolerance of one species at different concentrations and of different temperature regimes. The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages. The results confirm that the resistance testing kit is an effective device to recognize the resistance in an early stage, to fight against the development of resistance and to fight against the spreading of resistance. In future the resistance testing kit should be part of an integrated pest management system and a requirement for a good fumigation practice.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{innovative}} device designed and constructed {{to improve the}} fumigation process for stored foodstuffs {{with the use of}} phosphine gas in sealed chambers. The device allowed a considerable reduction in phosphine production time (from about 5 to 7 days for traditional systems to 2 days for the equipment considered), maintaining the system below the inflammability threshold, {{and at the same time}} achieving the total exhaustion of aluminum (or <b>magnesium)</b> <b>phosphide</b> so as to avoid toxic residues at the end of the process. With the standard device currently available on the market, after the normal 5 – 7 day fumigating period, the powder residue contains as much as 1 – 2 % (w/w) of phosphide. Thus the residues, according to current legislation, have to be considered toxic and harmful. To overcome this disadvantage, appropriate modifications were made to the cylindrical tray used for the fumigation process: a nebulizer was installed, which has the function of increasing the moisture of the air spreading around the phosphide pellets and allowing a more rapid reaction with phosphide. Moreover, the cylindrical tray was also heated by means of an electrical resistance, and temperature was checked by a thermostat, so as to always obtain the same efficiency, independently of outside temperature, for both hot and cold periods, since reaction speed depends on the system temperature considered. In addition, a control device for air saturation allows condensation processes to be avoided. Using the modified cylindrical tray we performed tests to determine the best values of humidity and temperature for the process concerned, avoiding phosphine concentrations that might result in a fire hazard, and the remixing of phosphide pellets inside the cylindrical tray. Our experimental data allowed us to obtain a mathematical model used to gain an insight into the process in question...|$|E
40|$|This Alert {{describes}} 205 {{cases of}} illness or injury in workers exposed to phosphine gas associated with phosphide fumigants. Information about these exposures is urgently needed by agricultural workers, employers, cooperative extension agents, physicians, {{and other health}} care providers. NIOSH therefore requests that editors of trade journals, safety and health officials, labor unions, and agricultural employers bring this Alert to the attention of all workers who handle products that generate phosphine gas. Phosphide fumigants release toxic phosphine gas (PH 3) when they contact moisture in the air. When phosphine is inhaled, it can react with moisture in the lungs to form phosphoric acid, which can cause blistering and edema. These effects can be serious or fatal. Exposure to phosphine has also been linked with other effects such as chest tightness, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Also, improper handling of aluminum and <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphide</b> has caused injuries from flash fires and explosions. In 1988, NIOSH published survey results showing that worker exposure to phosphine often substantially exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) [Zaebst et. al. 1988]. The case reports described in this Alert clearly illustrate the hazards to workers who handle or work near phosphide fumigants. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Cover title. "September 1999 " [...] P. [2] of cover.

40|$|Methyl Bromide for grain {{fumigation}} will {{be phased}} out in the U. S. by January 1, 2001. Alternative rapid fumigation methods are needed by U. S. grain storage, milling and export elevator industries. Aluminum phosphide pellets are slow and unpredictable. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>phosphide</b> releases faster, but are unstable and more expensive than aluminum phosphide. Although not as fast as Methyl Bromide, a liquid phosphine fumigant called "PhosfumeTM " developed by BOC Gases Ltd, Australia is a potential solution. Liquid phosphine is formulated in high pressure cylinders at 2 % PH 3, 98 % C 02, or 0 g/kg by weight (1994). Due to a prior U. S. phosphine fumigant copyright, BOC Gases, U. S. is introducing PhosfumTM in the U. S. A. as EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas. ECO 2 FUME TM fumigant gas is not temperature dependent, so a fumigation can be conducted quickly at predictable high, medium or low dosages and concentrations in storage or building spaces. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to compare EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas with a leading phosphine pellet, Degesh PhostoxinTM for labeling purposes. Tests compared daily gas levels between minimum dosage rates for commercial steel tanks for PhostoxinTM and EC 02 FUME TM fumigant gas targeted at 200 ppm during a 7 day period. Test were conducted in eleven 1. 8 m (6 ft) diameter by 2. 7 m (9 ft) high corrugated steel bins assembled on welded steel bases. During bin assembly, special care was used to seal all seams and joints to minimize gas leakage.
