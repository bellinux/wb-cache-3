Based on Hitchon et al. (1994), the concrete message with detailed information is considered having enough concrete words and contexts for <b>message</b> <b>recipients</b> to avoid multiple interpretations and have {{a clear understanding of}} the message. On the contrary, the abstract message without detailed information is considered having many abstract words and, consequently, <b>message</b> <b>recipients</b> {{would be less likely to}} understand the message clearly.|$|R
5000|$|Delegation - {{allows a}} <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> (keyholder) to {{generate}} a re-encryption key based on his secret key and the key of the delegated user.

But, {{rather than try}} to break the encryption, an eavesdropper may impersonate a <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> (during key exchange or by substituting his public key for the recipient's), so that messages are encrypted with a key known to the attacker. After decrypting the message, the snoop can then encrypt it with a key that he or she shares with the actual recipient, or his or her public key in case of asymmetric systems, and send the message on again to avoid detection. This is known as a man-in-the-middle attack.|$|E

50|$|The central {{route is}} used when the <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> has the {{motivation}} {{as well as}} the ability to think about the message and its topic. When people process information centrally, the cognitive responses, or elaborations, will be much more relevant to the information, whereas when processing peripherally, the individual may rely on heuristics and other rules of thumb when elaborating on a message. Being at {{the high end of the}} elaboration continuum, people assess object-relevant information in relation to schemas that they already possess, and arrive at a reasoned attitude that is supported by information. It is important to consider two types of factors that influence how and how much one will elaborate on a persuasive message. The first are the factors that influence our motivation to elaborate, and the second being the factors that influence our ability to elaborate. Motivation to process the message may be determined by a personal interest in the subject of the message, or individual factors like the need for cognition. However, if the <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> has a strong, negative attitude toward the position proposed by the message, a boomerang effect (an opposite effect) is likely to occur. That is, they will resist the message, and may move away from the proposed position. Two advantages of the central route are that attitude changes tend to last longer and are more predictive of behavior than the changes from the peripheral route. Overall, as people’s motivation and ability to process the message and develop elaborations decreases, the peripheral cues present in the situation become more important in their processing of the message.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decoding}} of {{a message}} is how an audience member is able to understand, and interpret the message. It {{is a process of}} interpretation and translation of coded information into a comprehensible form. The audience is trying to reconstruct the idea by giving meanings to symbols and by interpreting the message as a whole. Effective communication is accomplished only when the message is received and understood in the intended way. However, it is still possible for the <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> to understand a message in a completely different way from what was the encoder was trying to convey. This is when [...] "distortions" [...] or [...] "misunderstanding" [...] arise from [...] "lack of equivalence" [...] between the two sides in communicative exchange.|$|E
50|$|The {{transshipment}} function must handle any and {{all data}} sent to it by potential attackers. To be useful the function must be implemented without it being vulnerable to attack. This {{can be achieved by}} using Guard technology that separates the implementation into three parts - a destination proxy that interacts with the message originator and extracts the business information from messages, a verifier and a source proxy that creates a new message to carry the business information and interacts with the <b>message</b> <b>recipient.</b> The verifier's role is to ensure that the source proxy is only presented with the business information using the simple data format it is expecting. As a result, the attack surface is limited to the verifier's interface and that part of the source proxy's interface which is visible through the verifier.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept is}} that CaseKeys {{software}} is installed {{on either the}} client PC or the mail server which allows every message - both incoming and outgoing to be intercepted and processed. Outgoing messages are processed with each instance of the protected user’s email address being encoded with a unique CaseKey. The CaseKey encoding, the <b>message</b> <b>recipient,</b> and optionally other details of the outgoing message are then recorded. In the other direction, incoming messages are scanned for any CaseKey-encoded instances of the protected user’s email address, with the recovered CaseKey codes being authenticated against the list of those previously issued. Messages found to contain valid CaseKeys are then marked as not spam to prevent spam filters from misrouting {{the message to the}} user’s junk folder. Other particulars of the original message may also be recovered and included with the delivery of the message - such as who the original message was issued to and when it was issued. It may even be used to automatically include a copy of the original message for the convenience of the protected user.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} attitudes and persuasion began {{as the central}} focus of social psychology, {{featured}} {{in the work of}} psychologists Gordon Allport (1935) and Edward Alsworth Ross (1908). Allport described attitudes as [...] "the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology". Considerable research was devoted to the study of attitudes and persuasion from the 1930s through the late 1970s. These studies embarked on various relevant issues regarding attitudes and persuasion, such as the consistency between attitudes and behaviors and the processes underlying attitude/behavior correspondence. However, Petty and Cacioppo noticed a major problem facing attitude and persuasion researchers to the effect that there was minimal agreement regarding [...] "if, when, and how the traditional source, <b>message,</b> <b>recipient,</b> and channel variables affected attitude change". Noticing this problem, Petty and Cacioppo developed the elaboration likelihood model as their attempt to account for the differential persistence of communication-induced attitude change. Petty and Cacioppo suggested that different empirical findings and theories on attitude persistence could be viewed as stressing one of two routes to persuasion which they presented in their elaboration likelihood model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peripheral}} {{route is}} used when the <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> {{has little or}} no interest in the subject and/or has a lesser ability to process the message. Being {{at the low end of}} the elaboration continuum, recipients do not examine the information as thoroughly. With the peripheral route, they are more likely to rely on general impressions (e.g. [...] "this feels right/good"), early parts of the message, their own mood, positive and negative cues of the persuasion context, etc. Because people are [...] "cognitive misers," [...] looking to reduce mental effort, they often use the peripheral route and thus rely on heuristics (mental shortcuts) when processing information. When an individual is not motivated to centrally process an issue because they lack interest in it, or if the individual does not have the cognitive ability to centrally process the issue, then these heuristics can be quite persuasive. Robert Cialdini's Principles of Social Influence (1984), which include commitment, social proof, scarcity, reciprocation, authority, as well as liking the person who is persuading you, are some examples of frequently used heuristics. In addition, credibility can also be used as a heuristic in peripheral thinking because when a speaker is seen as having a higher credibility, then the listener may be more likely to believe the message. Credibility is a low-effort and somewhat reliable way to give us an answer of what to decide and/or believe without having to put in much work to think it through.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} aspects, which may {{contribute}} {{to whether or not}} a message's persuasive element is successful.

40|$|Persuasive {{messages}} are {{often accompanied by}} information that induces suspicions of invalidity. For instance, recipients of communications about a political candidate may discount a message coming from {{a representative of the}} opponent party because they do not perceive the source of the message as credible (e. g., Lariscy & Tinkham, 1999). Because the source of the political message serves as a discounting cue and temporarily decreases the impact of the <b>message,</b> <b>recipients</b> may not be persuaded by the advocacy immediately after they receive the communication. Over time, however, recipients of an otherwise influential message may recall the message but not the noncredible source and thus become more persuaded by the message at that time than they were immediately following the communication. The term sleeper effect was used to denote such a delayed increase in persuasion observed when the discounting cue (e. g., noncredible source) becomes unavailable or “dissociated ” from the communication in the memory of the <b>message</b> <b>recipients</b> (Hovland, Lumsdaine, & Sheffield, 1949). …[sectio...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{linguistic}} biases {{shows that}} stereotypic expectancies are implicitly reflected {{in language and}} are thereby subtly communicated to <b>message</b> <b>recipients.</b> We examined whether these findings extend {{to the use of}} negations (e. g., not smart instead of stupid). We hypothesized that people use more negations in descriptions of stereotype-inconsistent behavior than in descriptions of stereotype-consistent behavior. In 3 studies, participants either judged the applicability of experimentally controlled person descriptions or spontaneously produced person descriptions themselves. Results provided support for this hypothesis. Moreover, a 4 th study demonstrated that negations have communicative consequences. When a target person's behavior was described with negations, <b>message</b> <b>recipients</b> inferred that this behavior was an exception to the rule and that it was more likely caused by situational circumstances than by dispositional factors. These findings indicate that by using negations people implicitly communicate stereotypic expectancies and that negations play a subtle but powerful role in stereotype maintenance. © 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that people process persuasive messages {{to a greater extent}} when the source of the message is a group high rather than low in entitativity. Explanations of this phenomenon have centered on the notion that entitative groups represent a singular essence that elicits more elaborative cognition. However, effects of entitativity may be associated with preceptions that an entitative source is more able to put into place the advocated policy. These perceptions of source efficacy are hypothesized to interact with the position or direction of a message to produce opposing patterns of message processing. When the position of a message is counterattitudinal (opposing <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> 2 ̆ 7 s current attitudes), a highly entitative/efficacious source should elicit greater message-related thinking than a less entitative/efficacious source due to concern that the source may be likely to bring about the negative outcomes proposed. However, when appeals are proattitudinal (supporting <b>message</b> <b>recipient</b> 2 ̆ 7 s current attitudes), a source low rather than high in entitativity/efficacy should initiate greater message scrutiny due to concern that the source may be unlikely to facilitate the positive outcomes proposed. By examining entitativity of a group message source (Studies 1 - 3) or the efficacy of a single communicator (Studies 4 - 6), the results of six studies are consistent with predictions. Implications for research on group entitativity, source efficacy, and related constructs are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} system {{dynamics}} model of message-based communication, where the information-processing capacity of <b>message</b> <b>recipients</b> is limited.
