40|$|Precast {{pre-stressed}} {{hollow core}} (PHC) slabs are {{considered one of}} the best structural systems capable of covering large spans with <b>minimum</b> <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> and weight, and its ease of manufacturing and installation. The shear resistance of PHC slabs has not been well discussed in the different current codes. The codes have a general shear design approach. However, the shear behavior of PHC slabs is different from that of ordinary concrete elements with shear reinforcement. On the other hand, the design models of PHC slabs in current codes does not take into consideration the significant effect of concentrated load at transfer zone as well as no method to classify the expected mode of failure. In this research, a new proposed relationship is developed to calculate shear capacity of PHC slabs. Also, the significant effect of variation of concentrated load width with respect the slab width will be studied. The proposed relation will be verified for different slab thickness, level of pre-stressing, concrete strength, and for solid net area of PHC slabs. Instead of performing a costly experimental study to find out whether the effect of different factors on the prediction of shear behavior of PHC slabs, a numerical model (ANSIS 11) can be used after calibrating its accuracy with experimental data of two pre-stressed hollow core slabs. The comparisons are made for load-deflection curves, failure loads and crack patterns. The accuracy of the finit...|$|E

The {{thickness of the}} Jialingjiang Formation significantly changes in each sequence. The strata are thick {{in the northeast and}} thin in the southwest (Fig. 4). During the Sq 1, the thickness of the strata is gradually become thick from the southwest to the northeast. During the TST of Sq 1, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> varies little except in well Laolong 1, Wei 68 and Wei 14. During the HST of Sq 1, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> varies little except in well She 1. The thickness of the HST is thinner than the TST.

During the HST of Sq 1, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> varies little except in well Yunhe 4 and She 1. The thickness of the HST is thicker than the TST. During the Sq 3, the thickness of the strata is thinner in well Laolong 1 and She 1. During the TST of Sq 1, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> varies little except in well Wei 14. During the HST of Sq 1, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> is thin in the west and thick in the central and northeast of the basin. The thickness of the HST is thicker than the TST. Subsidence centers are located in Central and Northeast Sichuan subdepression, where the thickness is up to 1050  m. Laterally, the thickness of the strata in well Moshen 1, Nvshen 5, and Yunhe 4 increases, and is influenced by sedimentation due to denudation in the northeastern part of the basin {{as a result of the}} tectonic uplift in the Late Permian Changxing and Jialingjiang Formations (Tan et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|A {{decade ago}} we {{introduced}} empirically derived formulas which allowed one {{to estimate the}} performance which can be achieved {{in the design of}} broad-band antireflection (AR) coatings based upon the indices of refraction ofthe materials to used, the bandwidth required, and the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> of the coating. This {{has proved to be a}} useful tool to avoid attempting impossible designs and to guide the designer toward an optimal result. It can also be helpful to non-designers who need to know what can and cannot be done before specifying a system AR coating requirement. In the new work reported here, formulas with additional accuracy have been developed by further data generation and the application of modern statistical analysis tools. The <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> parameter used in the equations has also been better defined and understood, and the tendency of <b>overall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> to have quantization has been studied further.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{broadband}} antireflection (BBAR) coatings {{is based upon}} the indices of refraction of the materials to be used, the bandwidth required, the <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> of the coating, and the number of layers. Some useful tools have been found to guide the designer to optimal results such as: 1) recom-mended overall thickness; 2) observation of the low frequency (long wavelength) spectra beyond the AR band; 3) the reflec-tance versus coating thickness plot; 4) the shape of the passband trace, and 5) a definite number of layers required. It was also found that any more than the minimum number of layers increases the average reflectance. For small band-widths, designs tend to require a number of layers equal to six times the parameter of <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> divided by the mini-mum thickness. Whereas 10 times that parameter are needed for large bandwidths. It has further been our experience that the optimization of a starting design, other than a design of only a few layers, tends to reach a conclusion at a local minimum which is not always the best that can be achieved in the general region of available variables. The best <b>overall</b> <b>thickness</b> parameter used has a tendency to be quantized.
