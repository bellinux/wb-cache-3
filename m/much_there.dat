The hasty treatment that, in the beginning, the thirteenth century material received, revealed how <b>much</b> <b>there</b> was to learn before the archives could be used to the best advantage.|$|E
25|$|Rawdon Crawley's {{elder brother}} is ignorant, boorish, and mean. He {{inherits}} the Crawley estate from his elderly father, {{and he also}} inherits from his wealthy aunt, Miss Crawley. Sir Pitt is very religious and has political aspirations, although not many people appreciate his intelligence or wisdom because there's not <b>much</b> <b>there</b> to appreciate. Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Sir Pitt does nothing to help Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times. This is chiefly due {{to the influence of}} his wife Lady Jane who dislikes Becky because of her callous treatment of her son, and also because Becky repaid Lady Jane's earlier kindness by patronising her and flirting with Sir Pitt.|$|E
500|$|In 1834 {{a second}} edition was {{published}} {{under the name}} Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799. It had been heavily revised, as per Balzac's style of constantly reworking texts, even after their release. He had been corresponding with Ewelina Hańska, who wrote to him anonymously in 1832. In an attempt to please her, he changed some of the language in Les Chouans for its second edition. [...] "If only you knew," [...] he wrote to her, [...] "how <b>much</b> <b>there</b> is of you in every altered phrase of Chouans!" [...] The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Hańska.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{attained a}} mixed reception. Critics enjoyed the game's battle system, which deviated from role-playing game tradition. IGN's Craig Harris commented that [...] "unlike most Japanese RPGs Mario & Luigi's turn-based battle involves the player at all times". Despite this novel approach to combat situations, some reviewers {{thought that the}} overall gameplay lacked innovation. GameSpy in particular criticized the game for an apparent lack of originality, commenting that [...] "in terms of gameplay, there isn't <b>much</b> <b>there</b> that we haven't seen in the NES and SNES Mario and Zelda titles." [...] Furthermore, some reviewers were disappointed by a perceived lack of difficulty in the gameplay {{as a result of}} targeting a younger audience. However, Cubed3 welcomed this approach, citing that [...] "any gamer, be them [...] veterans to the genre or complete amateurs, will find the title to be perfectly accessible." [...] Edge and other gaming publications have criticized the controls for being occasionally confusing when considering the usage of jumping, hammers, and other combinations between the two characters.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, {{traffic in}} Ocean City {{increased}} so <b>much</b> <b>there</b> was {{a movement to}} make Baltimore and Philadelphia Avenues one-way in the downtown area, a change that was implemented by 1948. Traffic volume in Ocean City increased even more following {{the completion of the}} Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952, leading to expansion of the city's northsouth arterials. MD 378 was widened along its entire length in 1951 and 1952. MD 528 was widened to four lanes along its entire length in 1953 and 1954. Both state highways were extended to their present southern termini at that time. The first portion of MD 528 to be expanded to a divided highway was around the intersection with MD 90; the highway between 60th and 63rd Streets was reconstructed by 1978. Two sections of six-lane divided highway were completed around 1989: from 25th Street to 65th Street, and from 85th Street to 122nd Street. By 1991, MD 528 was divided highway from 25th Street to the Delaware state line. [...] The segment of Philadelphia Avenue from 9th Street to 25th Street was changed from a five- to six-lane highway with a center turn lane to a divided highway in 2001.|$|E

[...] "There was a big, giant search for Lois," [...] Snyder said. [...] "For us, it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so <b>much.</b> <b>There</b> is so much more pressure." ...|$|E

500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that <b>much.</b> <b>There</b> are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Southam's school {{proved to}} be stiffer {{competition}} than its predecessors. In 1856, both schools heeded a suggestion made by James Kay, the doctor and educationist, to approach Owens College {{with a view to}} a merger. E. M. Brockbank, a medical historian, says that [...] " [...] propositions apparently rather amazed the College people as being too one-sided- the schools giving too little and asking too <b>much</b> ...<b>There</b> were in the proposals, [...] said, a request for space, for power of administration, and for {{a large portion of the}} income of the College." [...] Thus the idea was abandoned and, later in the same year, the two medical schools amalgamated. The teaching then took place at Chatham Street until 1861 while improvements were made to the Pine Street premises. Those improvements included construction of a more imposing frontage on the Faulkner Street elevation; when the Chatham Street premises were sold and teaching transferred back to Pine Street, the school address was advertised as [...] "Faulkner Street behind the Infirmary" [...] and it became colloquially known as the Faulkner Street school from then onwards.|$|E

[...] However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that [...] "while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game's story isn't incredibly engaging." [...] This was compromised by stating that Age of Empires fans wouldn't expect an amazing campaign; they would [...] "make {{a beeline for the}} game's random map mode, anyway." [...] PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: [...] "many of the missions are extremely well-crafted", and that [...] "sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy — a truly delightful surprise." [...] However, they still found reasons to criticize: [...] "Regrettably, most of AoMs missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of 'build base-itis.'" [...] The reviewer elaborated: [...] "I know base-building is inherent to the genre, but even the most ardent fan will be put off by just how <b>much</b> <b>there</b> is. What's most disappointing is that AoMs setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design — and I don't think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame." ...|$|E
