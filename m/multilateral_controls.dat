Especially, if control is sought by a small power over a great power, then the Lilliputian strategy of small countries achieving control by collectively binding the great power is likely to be most effective. Similarly, if control is sought by a great power over another great power, then <b>multilateral</b> <b>controls</b> may be most useful. The great power could seek control through bilateral ties, but this would be costly; it also would require bargaining and compromise with the other great power. Embedding the target state in a multilateral alliance reduces the costs borne by the power seeking control, but it also offers the same binding benefits of the Lilliputian strategy. Furthermore, if a small power seeks control over another small power, multilateralism may be the only choice, because small powers rarely have the resources to exert control on their own. As such, power disparities are accommodated to the weaker states by having more predictable bigger states and means to achieve control through collective action. Powerful states also buy into multilateral agreements by writing the rules and having privileges such as veto power and special status.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the tradeoff between nonproliferation objectives and commercial interests regarding controls on American exports of dual-use technologies. It also {{examines the}} tension between both unilateral and <b>multilateral</b> export <b>controls</b> for dual-use machine tools. Strong unilateral export controls reduce the competitiveness of the U. S. machine tool industry, while relaxation of controls threatens to increase the spread {{of weapons of mass}} destruction by making enabling technologies available to developing states. Given the increasing globalization of defense production, <b>multilateral</b> export <b>controls</b> offer the best opportunity to retard the spread of sensitive technologies, especially if these controls are led by a strong state that is prepared to guide their implementation, verification, and enforcement. In order to influence the behavior of target countries and to demonstrate American resolve for the principles of nonproliferation, controls should include both sanctions and positive incentives. The United States should lead <b>multilateral</b> export <b>control</b> regimes. If controls are properly applied, opportunities for commercial exports may expand in the long term. The case of Iraq provides important insights into the potential for nuclear and dual-use technology proliferation in the absence of well-enforced controls.

Specifically, it investigates the emergence of control norms and the role and policy impact of non-governmental actors in the promotion of the norms. It asks whether the normative changes and significance of nongovernmental actors therein challenge the understanding of security governance that underpins many established approaches to international relations theory.

40|$|Multilateral Nuclear Approaches (MNAs) is {{a concept}} of {{international}} and/or <b>multilateral</b> <b>control</b> of nuclear material and/or nuclear fuel cycle facilities. It is a strategy for contributing to and promoting the sustainability of nuclear energy while enhancing nuclear nonproliferation, by ensuring nuclear fuel supplies and fuel cycle services, and risk control and reducing risk regarding nuclear safety. In order to establish such a MNA, the authors draw out 12 features of the MNA by analyzing various past and current MNA proposals, together with the current environment surrounding nuclear energy use. Those proposals are: (A) nuclear nonproliferation, (B) assurance of supply of nuclear material and fuel cycle services, (C) access to technologies, (D) multilateral involvement, (E) siting—choice of host state, (F) legal aspects, (G) political and public acceptance, (H) economics, (I) nuclear safety, (J) nuclear liability, (K) transportation, and (L) geopolitics.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a sliding-mode-based design frame-work for fully {{actuated}} mechanical multibody {{system is}} discussed. The framework {{is based on}} the possibility to represent complex motion as a collection of tasks and to find effective mapping of the system coordinates that allows decoupling task and constraint control so one is able to enforce concurrently, or in certain time succession, the task and the constraints. The approach seems nat-urally encompassing the control of motion systems in interaction, and it allows application to bilateral <b>control,</b> <b>multilateral</b> <b>control,</b> etc. Such an approach leads to a more natural interpretation of the system tasks, simpler controller design, and easier establish-ment of the systems hierarchy. It allows a unified mathematical treatment of task control in the presence of constraints required to be satisfied by the system coordinates. In order to show the applicability of the proposed techniques, simulation and experi-mental results for high-precision systems in microsystem assembly tasks and bilateral control systems are presented.

40|$|In recent years, the {{multilateral}} {{approach to the}} nuclear fuel cycle has been promoted as a potential mechanism for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime.

This thesis explores the way in which four states have responded to the revived attention on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, {{within the framework of the}} norm life cycle. The varying levels of support reflect broader international opinion on this issue, as many developing states remain concerned that they may be required to forgo not only the “inalienable right” to peaceful nuclear energy, but also the prospective economic and technological benefits of indigenous development in order to participate. However, as the risk of further proliferation and nuclear terrorism comes to the fore of international agendas, facilitating <b>multilateral</b> <b>control</b> of the most sensitive aspects of peaceful nuclear energy may be the key to strengthening the non-proliferation regime in the 21 st century...|$|R
