Seawater was circulated in a semiclosed flow system through biofilm reactors (3 cm s− 1) with <b>microscope</b> <b>cover</b> slips arranged in lamellar piles parallel with the flow. At fixed time intervals cover slips with their biofilm were removed from the pile, stained with crystal violet, and mounted on microscope slides.

From calibration experiments a staining time of 1 min and a rinse time of 10 min in a tap water flow (3 cm s− 1) were considered sufficient. When an analysis of variance was performed on biofilm development data, 78 % of the total variance was found to be due to random natural effects; the rest could be explained by experimental effects. The absorbance values correlated well with protein N, dry weight, and organic weight in two biofilm experiments, one with a biofilm with a high (75 %) and one with a low (∼ 25 %, normal) inorganic content.

40|$|Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an {{electrokinetic}} force {{capable of}} attracting or repelling neutrally charged particles {{due to a}} non-uniform electric field [1, 2]. Positive dielectrophoresis attracts particles {{in the region of}} the highest electric field gradient; negative dielectrophoresis repels particles from the region of the highest electric field gradient. The dielectrophoretic force is directly proportional to the square of the electric field gradient, as well as the cube of the radius of the particles involved. As particles decrease in size, the gradient of the electric field must increase rapidly in order to capture or repel the particles. The intense electric field gradients were produced using fabricated silver gallium (Ag 2 Ga) nano-probes electrodes in conjunction with indium tin oxide (ITO) coated <b>microscope</b> <b>cover</b> slips, which served as the opposite electrode. The silver gallium nano-probes ranged from approximately 100 - 500 nm in diameter and were typically positioned less than 40 ?m above the ITO cover slips.

DNA histograms of rat thymocytes stained with ethidium bromide and mithramycin demonstrate that all angles of incidence can be used.

It has been demonstrated that optical coherence phase microscopy (OCPM) can provide quantitative phase information with very high sensitivity. The excellent phase stability of OCPM is obtained by use of a reflection from the <b>microscope</b> <b>cover</b> glass as a local reference field. For detailed intracellular studies a large numerical aperture (N. A.) objective is {{needed in order to}} obtain the required resolution. Unfortunately, this also means that the depth of field becomes too small to obtain sufficient power from the cover glass when the beam is focused into the sample. To address this issue, we designed a setup with a dual-beam sample arm. One beam with a large diameter (filling the 1. 2 N. A. water immersion objective) enabled high-resolution imaging. A second beam with a small diameter (underfilling the same objective) had a larger depth of field and could detect the cover glass used as a local phase reference. The phase stability of the setup was quantified by monitoring the front and back of a cover glass. The standard deviation of the phase difference was 0. 021 rad, corresponding to an optical path displacement of 0. 9 nm. The lateral and axial dimensions of the confocal point spread function were 0. 42 and 0. 84 μm, respectively.

A model for the equilibrium surface tension of a single protein solution based on 3 -D dense packing has been provided.

Modeling of protein adsorption has been, in general, confounded by the inability to accurately measure the surface excess at the gas liquid interface.
