Mother-child pairs engaged in a structured beanbag toss game which was videotaped and analyzed by a bilingual coder unaware of the medical back-grounds of the children. In contrast to <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child <b>with</b> asthma or in good health, <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child <b>with</b> epilepsy used fewer verbal direc-tions and fewer positive responses. In addition, <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child <b>with</b> epilepsy used more nonverbal directions, more commands, and more physi-cal guidance. Children with epilepsy also failed more often on the structured beanbag toss game than children with asthma and children in good health. Finally, native-born <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child <b>with</b> epilepsy exhibited less posi-tive feedback and more negative feedback than their immigrant counterparts <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similar child.

40|$|With over 400, 000 infants being hospitalized in the NICU annually, it is {{important}} to understand adjustment in their mothers. Taylor’s cognitive theory of adaptation asserts that three factors, meaning making, control, and self-enhancement, influence positive adjustment in a crisis situation such as a NICU hospitalization. Since it has never been examined, the purpose of the current study was to test the utility of Taylor’s model in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infant in the NICU. Data was collected from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infant in the NICU (N = 181) and the main hypothesis was that meaning making, control, and self-enhancement would explain a significant portion of variance in depression scores in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infant in the NICU. Results from this study did not support this hypothesis. Still, this study {{is important}} in guiding future research to better understand the adjustment process of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infant in the NICU...|$|R

25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

25|$|Mixing {{deduction}} and character-driven drama, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation {{follows a}} team of crime-scene investigators, employed by the Las Vegas Police Department, as they use physical evidence to solve murders. The team is originally led by Gil Grissom (William Petersen), a socially awkward forensic entomologist and career criminalist who is promoted to CSI supervisor {{following the death of}} a trainee investigator. Grissom's second-in-command, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), is a single <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cop's instinct. Born and raised in Vegas, Catherine was a stripper before being recruited into law enforcement and training as a blood-spatter specialist. Following Grissom's departure during the ninth season of the series, Catherine is promoted to supervisor. After overseeing the training of new investigator Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne), Willows is replaced by D.B. Russell (Ted Danson), and recruited to the FBI shortly thereafter. Russell is a family man, a keen forensic botanist and a veteran of the Seattle Crime Lab. In the series' 12th season, Russell is reunited with his former partner Julie Finlay (Elisabeth Shue), who like Catherine, is a blood-spatter expert with an extensive knowledge of criminal psychology. Together {{with the rest of the}} team, they work together to tackle Las Vegas' growing crime rate and are on the case 24/7, scouring the scene, collecting the evidence, and finding the missing pieces that will solve the mystery.|$|E

No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E

The book's opening chapters find Maya concerned with, as Hagen asserts, [...] "apprehension about her son, a desire for a home, and facing racial conflicts, and seeking a career". Maya is offered a job as a salesgirl in a record shop on Fillmore Street in San Francisco.
