5000|$|With {{current network}} {{management}} technologies, management functions typically reside outside the network in management stations and servers, which interact with network elements and devices via network protocols for management, {{in order to}} execute management tasks, including fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management, or, short (FCAPS). Most of these tasks are performed on a per-device basis. During network operation, for instance, a <b>management</b> <b>station</b> periodically polls individual devices in its domain for the values of local variables, such as devices counters or performance parameters. These variables are then processed on the <b>management</b> <b>station</b> to compute an estimate of a network-wide state, which is analyzed and acted upon by management applications. This paradigm of interaction between the management system and managed system underlies traditional management frameworks and protocols, including SNMP, TMN [...] and OSI-SM.|$|E

These attacks, a form of Denial of service, use port knocking functionality to lock out known IP addresses (e.g. administrator <b>management</b> <b>stations)</b> by sending packets with the spoofed IP address to random ports. Servers using static addressing are especially vulnerable to these types of denials of service as their addresses are well known.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ever-increasing}} competition among airlines, manifested in particular in ground services and airport flight operations, airline <b>station</b> <b>management</b> has become a core activity. This paper treats the problems of airline <b>station</b> <b>management.</b> First, passenger-, airport-, and flight-related activities are presented and described in detail, then analyzed by means of a functional analysis. From this analysis a generalized ideal model of an airline <b>station</b> <b>management</b> system is derived, i. e. a model representing those goals every airline should strive to meet. The method employed to analyze related operations allows a unique hierarchy to be constructed, a hierarchy which can be considered a target system. The method also enables one to identify specific goals deemed worthy of further pursual. In addition to the above, this paper presents for the first time, a comparison of the <b>station</b> <b>management</b> systems of international airlines in Europe, North America, and Asia. The empirical investigation carried out reveals that the strategies and philosophies of airlines with regard to <b>station</b> <b>management</b> differ, and that the <b>station</b> <b>management</b> systems of European, North American and Asian airlines can be clustered into regional groups, based upon behaviour patterns characteristic of those regions. Additionally, a relationship between the <b>station</b> <b>management</b> systems of airlines and the conditions imposed by airline regulations in the respective region can be demonstrated. (orig.)

5000|$|In {{terms of}} the network {{management}} model, a network <b>management</b> <b>station</b> (NMS) is one that executes network management applications (NMAs) that monitor and control network elements (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These network elements use a management agent (MA) to perform the network management functions requested by the network management stations. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management information between the network management stations and the agents in the network elements. NMS is described in RFC 1157 [...] "A Simple Network Management Protocol".|$|E

SNMP traps enable an agent {{to notify the}} <b>management</b> <b>station</b> of significant events by way of an unsolicited SNMP message. Includes current sysUpTime value, an OID identifying the type of trap and optional variable bindings. Destination addressing for traps is determined in an application-specific manner typically through trap configuration variables in the MIB. The format of the trap message was changed in SNMPv2 and the PDU was renamed SNMPv2-Trap. While in classic communication the client always actively requests information from the server, SNMP allows the additional use of so-called [...] "traps".

50|$|When a fault {{or event}} occurs, a network {{component}} will often send a notification {{to the network}} operator using either a proprietary or open protocol such as SNMP (such as WhatsUp Gold, HP OpenView or Sun Solstice-formerly Net Manager), to collect information about network devices or at least write a message to its console for a console server to catch and log/page. In turn, the <b>management</b> <b>station</b> can be configured to make a network administrator aware of problems (by email, paging, or on-screen messages), allowing appropriate action to be taken. This notification is supposed to trigger manual or automatic activities. For example, the gathering of more data to identify the nature and severity of the problem or to bring backup equipment on-line.|$|E
