40|$|Abstract Background The National Child <b>Measurement</b> <b>Programme</b> was {{established}} to measure the height and weight of children at primary school in England and provides parents with feedback about their child’s weight status. In this study we will evaluate {{the impact of the}} National Child <b>Measurement</b> <b>Programme</b> feedback on parental risk perceptions of overweight, lifestyle behaviour and health service use. Methods The study will be a prospective cohort study of parents of children enrolled in the National Child <b>Measurement</b> <b>Programme</b> and key service providers from 5 primary care trusts (administrative bodies responsible for providing primary and secondary care services). We will conduct baseline questionnaires, followed by provision of weight feedback and 3 follow up questionnaires {{over the course of a}} year. Questionnaires will measure change in parental risk perception of overweight, health behaviours and health service use. Qualitative interviews will be used to identify barriers and facilitators to change. This study will produce preliminary data on National Health Service costs associated with weight feedback and determine which feedback approach (letter and letter plus telephone) is more effective.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to review the evidence on the consequences associated with the introduction of national performance measurement systems in the National Health Service (NHS), with the aim of informing the development of similar national performance <b>measurement</b> <b>programmes</b> proposed for Australia. Narrative review of the published evidence on the unintended and adverse consequences of performance measurement systems in the NHS is the data source. We identified 20 different dysfunctional consequences of national performance measurement systems in the NHS in four headings. These are poor measurement (measurement fixation, tunnel vision, myopia, ossification, anachronism and quantification privileging), misplaced incentives and sanctions (complacency, silo-creation, overcompensation, undercompensation, insensitivity and increased inequality), breach of trust (misrepresentation, gaming, misinterpretation, bullying, erosion of trust and reduced staff morale), and politicisation of performance systems (political grandstanding and creating a diversion). Performance <b>measurement</b> <b>programmes</b> can contribute to systems improvement, delivering benefits to health services and patients, as evidenced by the dramatic reduction in waiting times in the NHS following the incorporation of targets and indicators for waiting times. Nevertheless, experience from the NHS shows that in addition to generating desired improvements, performance measures can induce a range of unintended and dysfunctional consequences. We recommend Australia to heed the lessons of the NHS, and strive to balance effective performance measurement and management against the potential drawbacks and adverse consequences. Any national performance measures need to be piloted and carefully evaluated to assess potential benefits and pitfalls. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Progress {{in fields}} such as {{astronomy}} and fundamental physics can require increasingly complex instrumentation operating at millikelvin temperatures. Such instruments often have demands on materials and components which have not been seen previously, particularly for space based instrumentation. The large scale of these projects and tight timescales forces as conservative design as possible. However, building these instruments with conventional techniques and materials is often impractical and sometimes impossible. It is therefore common for the design stage of such instruments to include test and <b>measurement</b> <b>programmes.</b> This adds risk to the development schedule, and such programmes also suffer from the problem that they are tightly focused on the exact needs of one particular instrument. We are setting up a laboratory to measure material properties and develop cryogenic components for general use in future large millikelvin instruments. By decoupling these measurements from a particular instrument programme, we {{have the freedom to}} make more speculative measurements, such as measuring new polymers whose cryogenic properties are completely unknown. We describe our set-up and the results of initial work. 1...|$|E

40|$|The Antarctic Seasonal Ice Zone (ASIZ) is {{potentially}} a large contemporary sink for anthropogenic CO 2 {{due to the}} formation of bottom water along the Antarctic coast. However, south of 55 °S, the lack of measurements of the fugacity of CO 2 in surface seawater (fCO 2), or the concentration and ratio of stable carbon isotopes of atmospheric CO 2, has meant that it has been difficult to determine whether the ASIZ acts as a net source or sink for atmospheric CO 2.

At frequencies above 10 GHz, the effects on radio propagation of clouds, snow and, in particular, rain have to be considered. Measured data, and models to predict the effect of rain on communication systems, are therefore required before establishing satellite communication systems. Crane (1990) has indicated that out of 317 rain attenuation data bases available from CCIR either from radiometer or beacon receiver measurements, only 18 are in the wet tropical region.

40|$|Predicting the {{evolution}} of climate over decadal timescales requires a quantitative understanding of the dynamics that govern the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) 1. Comprehensive ocean <b>measurement</b> <b>programmes</b> aiming to monitor MOC variations have been established in the subtropical North Atlantic 2, 3 (RAPID, at latitude 26. 5 ° N, and MOVE, at latitude 16 ° N) and show strong variability on intraseasonal to interannual timescales. Observational evidence of longer-term changes in MOC transport remains scarce, owing to infrequent sampling of transoceanic sections over past decades 4, 5. Inferences based on long-term sea surface temperature records, however, supported by model simulations, suggest a variability with an amplitude of plusminus 1. 5 – 3 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m 3 s- 1) on decadal timescales in the subtropics 6. Such variability {{has been attributed to}} variations of deep water formation in the sub-arctic Atlantic, particularly the renewal rate of Labrador Sea Water 7. Here we present results from a model simulation that suggest an additional influence on decadal MOC variability having a Southern Hemisphere origin: dynamic signals originating in the Agulhas leakage region at the southern tip of Africa. These contribute a MOC signal in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic that is of the same order of magnitude as the northern source. A complete rationalization of observed MOC changes therefore also requires consideration of signals arriving from the south...|$|E
