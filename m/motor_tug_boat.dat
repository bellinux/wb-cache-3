40|$|The {{increase}} {{of information technology}} development makes the District Government especially Department of Transportation, Communication and Information (Dishubkominfo) Katingan, Central Kalimantan must to provide better public services for the community. E-Government Implementation should be improved by changing the conventional public service into an online system to achieve good governance system, or also known as E-Governance. Making the government official website is one ways to provide online public services, facilitate communication between community and government, as well as making people to be pro-active towards any particular policy issues related to levies on Dishubkominfo Katingan. E-Govemance's software engineering design {{in the form of}} this website will be equipped with security protection systems as a foitti of multiple layered security password on the website, which aims to prevent the public data that must pay levies misused by others. First password is done by login using user name and password received from the office of the Department of Transportation, Communication and Information Katingan, while the second password is the OTP (One-Time-Password) in the form challenge key which organized by several random numbers that can only used for one-time transactions and will change in the next transaction transmitted through the mobile user. This safety protection system adopted from e-commerce payment systems who utilize the simcard in the mobile user as a smartcard, so that it can deliveries OTP via SMS gateway platform. The design of this E-Governance software engineering is limited to people who have a compulsory levy of river transport vehicles (<b>motor</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boats,</b> barges and speed boats), because for now they had difficulty for manage the letter as they life far from the Capital District. Although for later development this system can be use for all retribution that must be pay through Department of Transportation, Communication and Information Katingan. The design of this e-governance levies have been successful, as evidenced by the design result at SKPL and DPPL documents, and this design has been receipt on Quality in Research seminar (QiR) in Bali at 4 - 7 July 2011 by the form of paper with the title "Design of E-Governance Retribution at the Department of Transportation, Communication and Information of Katingan Regency, Central Kalimantan Province". ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} of bollard pull harbour tug focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description of bollard pull harbour <b>tug,</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> functions, <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for <b>tug</b> <b>boats,</b> stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement of the bollard pull harbour tug are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis is important part because it deals with how the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> moving in a stable and balanced during its operation...|$|R
