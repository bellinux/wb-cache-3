25|$|Singing and {{percussion}} are {{the most}} important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and <b>multipart</b> singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical vocables (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.|$|E

500|$|... "Disposable Heroes" [...] is an anti-war {{song about}} a young soldier whose fate is {{controlled}} by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, {{it is one of}} the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of [...] "Leper Messiah" [...] challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of [...] "Lie!". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song [...] "Ziggy Stardust". [...] "Orion" [...] is a <b>multipart</b> instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and <b>multipart</b> guitar harmonies. [...] "Damage, Inc." [...] rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach's [...] "Come, Sweet Death". The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Manufacturing process {{planning}} (MPP) {{is concerned with}} decisions regarding selection of an optimal configuration for processing parts. For <b>multiparts</b> reconfigurable manufacturing lines, such decisions are strongly influenced by the types of processes available, the relationships for sequencing the processes and the order of processing parts. Decisions may conflict, hence the decision making tasks {{must be carried out}} in a concurrent manner. This paper outlines an optimization solution technique for the MPP problem in reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs). MPP is modelled in an optimization perspective and the solution methodology is provided through a metaheuristic technique known as simulated annealing. Analytical functions for modelling MPP are based on knowledge of processes available to the manufacturing system as well as processing constraints. Application of this approach is illustrated through a multistage parallel-serial reconfigurable manufacturing line. The results show that significant improvements to the solution of this type of problem can be gained through the use of simulated annealing. Moreover, the metaheuristic technique is able to identify an optimal manufacturing process plan for a given production scenario...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{explores the}} {{capabilities}} of genetic algorithms in handling optimization of the criticalissues mentioned above {{for the purpose of}} manufacturing process planning in reconfigurable manufacturingactivities. Two modified genetic algorithms are devised and employed to provide the best approximate processplanning solution. Modifications included adapting genetic operators to the problem specific knowledge andimplementing application specific heuristics to enhance the search efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: The genetic algorithm methodology implements a genetic algorithmthat is augmented by application specific heuristics in order to guide the search for an optimal solution. The case study is based on the manufacturing system. Raw materials enter the system through an input stageand exit the system through an output stage. The system is composed of sixteen (16) processing modulesthat are arranged in four processing stages. Findings: The results indicate that the two genetic algorithms are able to converge to optimal solutionsin reasonable time. A computational study shows that improved solutions can be obtained by implementinga genetic algorithm with an extended diversity control mechanism. Research limitations/implications: This paper has examined the issues of MPP optimization in a reconfigurablemanufacturing framework {{with the help of a}} reconfigurable <b>multiparts</b> manufacturing flow line. Originality/value: The results of the case illustration have demonstrated the practical use of diversity controlimplemented in the MGATO technique. In comparison to MGAWTO, the implemented MGATO improves thepopulation diversity through a customized threshold operator. It was clear that the MGATO can obtain bettersolution quality by foiling the tendency towards premature convergence...|$|R

2500|$|Author and musicologist Walter Everett {{recognises}} {{the album}} {{as a successful}} combination of [...] "rich <b>multipart</b> vocals brimming with expressive dissonance treatment, a deep exploration of different guitars and the capos that produced different colors from familiar finger patterns, surprising new timbres and electronic effects, a more soulful pentatonic approach to vocal and instrumental melody tinged by frequent twelve-bar jams that accompanied the more serious recording, and a fairly consistent search for meaningful ideas in lyrics". Everett credits several of these qualities, as on Revolver, as the inspiration for many progressive rock bands of the early 1970s. Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, he also identifies Rubber Soul as a work that was [...] "made more to be thought about than danced to", and an album that [...] "began a far-reaching trend" [...] in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music.|$|E
