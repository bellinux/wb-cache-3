5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, <b>mainsail,</b> main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|With {{the wind}} strengthening, Schomberg marshalled his forces and {{advanced}} on Roquebert's squadron. The French were clustered together {{in support of}} Néréide, whose crew were attempting to make hasty repairs while the squadron limped in a northwesterly direction towards Madagascar. Following the French lights, Schomberg pursued the French in the darkness and when Clorinde lost a man overboard and stopped to rescue him at 21:50, Roquebert was forced to fall back and protect his consort from being overwhelmed. Steering Renommée directly at Astraea, Roquebert opened fire at close range but was soon surrounded, with Astraea on one side, Racehorse on the other and Phoebe raking her stern. In a ferocious 25 minute engagement, Roquebert was killed and the French flagship suffered severe damage, surrendering after a shot from Racehorse ignited her <b>mainsail.</b> The British ships were also badly damaged: Racehorse was unable to launch a boat to take possession of Renommée due to a fallen topmast on her deck and Astraeas boats all badly damaged by shot and leaked severely during the short row to the stricken French vessel.|$|E
25|$|A brig is a {{sailing vessel}} with two square-rigged masts. During the Age of Sail, brigs {{were seen as}} fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval {{warships}} and merchant vessels. They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use {{with the arrival of}} the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind. They are not to be confused with a brigantine, which has different rigging (a brigantine has a gaff-rigged <b>mainsail,</b> while a brig has a square <b>mainsail</b> with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the <b>mainsail).</b>|$|E
60|$|Large <b>mainsails</b> {{were given}} {{them for their}} boats, with a {{lighthouse}} painted on each, and every man obtained besides a silver medal of exemption from impressment.|$|R
50|$|Roller furling is {{a method}} of furling or reefing a sail by rolling it around a stay or {{rotating}} spar. Roller furling is most prominent on foresails such as jibs, followed by <b>mainsails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bermuda <b>mainsails</b> {{may have}} slides {{attached}} to the luff that match tracks on the mast and boom. These may be {{attached to the}} luff through grommets with webbing or a nylon shackle or with webbing sewn directly on the sail.|$|R
25|$|The fleet {{comprises}} mostly sloops, that is yachts with {{a single}} mast on which is hoisted a fore-and-aft rigged <b>mainsail</b> and a single jib or genoa, plus extras such as a spinnaker.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, StGiles House was requisitioned {{and used}} as a girls school {{evacuated}} from London called, Miss Faunce's Parents' National Union School. At that time, the family took up residence at the dower house, known as <b>Mainsail</b> Haul.|$|E
25|$|A dinghy {{is a type}} {{of small}} open {{sailboat}} commonly used for recreation, sail training, and tending a larger vessel. They are popular in youth sailing programs for their short LOA, simple operation and minimal maintenance. They have three (or fewer) sails: the <b>mainsail,</b> jib, and spinnaker.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's a daisy," [...] said Dan, enthusiastically, {{misunderstanding}} the look. [...] "Wait till our <b>mainsail's</b> bent, an' {{she walks}} home {{with all her}} salt wet. There's some work first, though." [...] He pointed down {{into the darkness of}} the open main-hatch between the two masts.|$|R
50|$|Most coypu <b>mainsails</b> are {{normally}} raised by feeding the luff into the track on the mast, although some variants have gunter rig sails. The mainsheet is {{fixed to the}} stern of the boat. A jib is used for normal use and only one size is available.|$|R
50|$|Leech {{lines are}} found on <b>mainsails</b> and large jibs {{to tighten the}} leech and prevent fluttering. They run through a sleeve on the leech from the head to the clew, where there is usually a clam cleat to tighten it. Occasionally, foot lines perform an {{analogous}} function on a loose-footed sail.|$|R
25|$|In April 2011, Branson {{appeared}} on CNN's <b>Mainsail</b> with Kate Winslet. Together they re-enacted a famous {{scene from the}} 1997 film Titanic for the cameras. On 17 August 2011, he was featured in the premier episode of Hulu's first long-form original production entitled, A Day in the Life.|$|E
25|$|A {{fractional}} rigged sloop has its forestay attached {{at a point}} {{below the}} top of the mast, allowing the <b>mainsail</b> to be flattened to improve performance by raking {{the upper part of the}} mast aft by tensioning the backstay. A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{and sport}} {{catamarans}} typically {{are designed to}} have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the <b>mainsail.</b> Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} large <b>mainsails,</b> spinnakers are also {{generally}} much larger for a given hull size than had previously been used. Many sportsboats are fitted with an extendible bowsprit of 4-8 feet (1.2-2.5m) length, which moves the tack of the spinnaker away forward from the hull and allows better airflow and a larger sail size.|$|R
2500|$|Catamarans {{are fast}} twin hulled boats that {{fall under the}} {{definition}} of dinghy, unlike dinghies catamarans have high aspect ratio rigs with fully battened <b>mainsails</b> and a rotating mast, this allows the rig to be highly aerodynamic and gives a catamaran with two slim hulls its great speed advantage over traditional monohulls. Dinghy-sized catamarans are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Beach Catamarans".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] {{returned}} the cockswain; [...] "them cutters carries a press of canvas when {{they seem to}} have but little; their gafts are all the same as young booms, and spread a broad head to their <b>mainsails.</b> But it's no hard matter to knock a few cloths out of their bolt-ropes, when she will both drop astarn and to leeward." ...|$|R
25|$|Bound from Samoa to Australia, Slocum {{encountered}} gales {{and heavy}} seas that foundered the American clipper ship Patrician running a course south of Spray. A French mail steamer blown off course reported seeing Spray {{at the height}} of the storm and wondered what sad fate had befallen the little ship. Slocum's log records that, at the time that passengers of the steamer were up to their knees in water in the big ship's saloon, Spray was laying snug under a goose-winged <b>mainsail.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a <b>mainsail</b> above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E
25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom <b>mainsail</b> (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
25|$|Mhadei {{was built}} to a stock design by van de Stadt called Tonga 56 {{measuring}} 56 feet in length and displacing 23 tons. It was decided to build a wood-core and fibreglass sandwich hull for better performance than steel or aluminium. The boat has two <b>mainsails,</b> two Genoa's, a stay-sail, one try-sail and two gennaker's. She is also fitted with satellite communications and electronic navigation systems.|$|R
50|$|The large <b>mainsails</b> {{differ from}} western style gaff rigs though, {{as they often}} {{do not have a}} boom and the sail is not lowered with the gaff. Instead it is reefed towards the mast, much like a curtain, thus {{allowing}} the gaff to be used as deck crane in the harbour. The lower part of the mast itself may resemble a tripod or is made of two poles.|$|R
6000|$|Proudly {{the flood}} comes in, shouting, foaming, advancing, [...] Long it holds at the high, with bosom broad outswelling, [...] All throbs, dilates--the farms, woods, streets of cities--workmen at work, [...] <b>Mainsails,</b> topsails, jibs, {{appear in the}} offing--steamers' pennants [...] of smoke--and under the forenoon sun, [...] Freighted with human lives, gaily the outward bound, gaily the [...] inward bound, [...] Flaunting from many a spar the flag I love.|$|R
25|$|On 9 April 1799, after reconnoitering two French frigates in L'Orient, St Fiorenzo and HMS Amelia sailed towards Belle Île. Conditions were hazy and {{although}} Neale had sighted some vessels, {{it was only}} when he had passed the island that he discovered three French frigates and a large gun vessel. At that instant a sudden squall carried away Amelias main-top-mast and fore and mizzen top-gallant masts; the fall of the main-top-mast tore away much of the <b>mainsail</b> from the yard. Neale shortened St Fiorenzos sail and ordered Amelia to keep close to St Fiorenzo to maintain the weather gage, and to prepare for battle. An action commenced but the French vessels avoided close-quarter action and, although the British ships came under fire from shore batteries, they had to bear down on the French three times to engage them. After nearly two hours the French wore ship and sailed away to take refuge in the Loire, with the gun-vessel returning to Belle Île.|$|E
25|$|This {{traditional}} schooner design had {{a number}} of drawbacks. The shallow hull did not, in fact, contribute significantly to speed, and the wide stern design actually hindered fast sailing. The ships shallowness of hull gave them a high center of gravity that made them prone to capsizing and sinking in heavy seas, often with significant or total loss of life among their crews. The foremast rising to the same height as the mainmast often meant either that the jib when raised {{to the top of the}} foremast caused an inefficient, asymmetrical sail pattern, or that the upper parts of the foremast were left unused; having a foremast that was taller than necessary added extra expense to the cost of the ships construction and also meant that she had an unnecessary amount of weight aloft, making her less stable and more prone to dangerous rolling and capsizing. The large jib also created problems, moving the sails center of effort too far forward when the schooner shortened sail and the <b>mainsail</b> was reefed, making the ship harder to handle. Moreover, handling the large jib required crew members to work on the bowsprit in bad weather, a dangerous practice that resulted in men being swept overboard and drowned.|$|E
25|$|The French fleet, {{composed}} of 14 galleons, 13 pataches, 17 galleys and 3 fireships, was soon put on line {{and opened fire}} on the Spanish fleet. Sourdis' vice-admiral was ahead with 6 ships and 5 galleys, Sourdis followed him with 11 ships and 7 galleys, while 12 ships and 5 galleys closed the formation. Sourdis sailed towards the Point of Salou, attempting to bar the way to Maqueda. The Spaniards immediately responded to the fire with their galleons, causing serious damage to the French galleons, and forcing the French fleet to leave the harbor entrance. With the blockade broken, and the French fleet engaged in battle with the Spanish galleons, the Spanish convoy of 65 ships, escorted by some Spanish galleys, entered the port, to the great joy of the defenders. Having achieved the main objective, the Spanish galleys were reorganized and attacked the flank of the French fleet. At the same time, Maqueda fell upon the French vanguard supported by his galleons. In {{the middle of the}} action, the ship under admiral Orellana lost its <b>mainsail</b> and had to be relieved by the Testa de Oro. The French galleons Forte and Licorne were put out of action, but Sourdis did not lost a single ship. Having managed to hold off a superior fleet, he ordered the withdrawal on 25 August. But if he had saved his whole fleet, the Spaniards had obtained the naval control of the area. The siege of Tarragona was lifted, and the Spanish fleet was able to provision the towns of Roses, Perpignan and Collioure.|$|E
5000|$|The weave {{density of}} {{polyethylene}} strips {{in the inner}} layer determines {{the quality of the}} material. Common tarps have a weave of about 6 x 8. [...] "Canopy grade" [...] white polytarps, on the other hand, have a weave of 12 x 14 or 14 x 14. Increasingly, white polytarp is used to construct <b>mainsails,</b> jibs, and mizzens, while the lightweight polytarp materials are reserved for making spinnakers.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes a storm {{would blow}} up suddenly, {{and then the}} nets had to be got on board with all speed, and the topsails lowered and <b>mainsails</b> reefed, and the fleet of perhaps a hundred vessels would go racing back into Harwich, there to anchor just above the Guard, or under shelter of the Shotley Spit, or a short way up the Orwell, {{according}} to {{the direction of the}} wind.|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this time}} that both the OROHENA and the Hira, running in close to the shore, began firing guns and {{signalling}} frantically. The three men stepped outside {{in time to see the}} two schooners go hastily about and head off shore, dropping <b>mainsails</b> and flying jibs on the run in the teeth of the squall that heeled them far over on the whitened water. Then the rain blotted them out.|$|R
500|$|According to its website, {{the ferry}} {{operated}} informally from 1759 {{and in an}} organized way from 1799. The earliest ferries {{are believed to have}} been rowboats or canoes; [...] "a double-ended sailing scow was in service by 1800. [...] This vessel was about [...] long, with a <b>mainsail</b> that would swing completely around the mast to provide a simple means of reversing course." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 28, 1823, {{months after}} the El Scipión case was settled, Cofresí {{attacked}} a ship registered to the harbor of Patillas and robbed the small fishing boat of 800 pesos in cash. Cofresí attacked {{with other members of}} his gang and that of another pirate, Manuel Lamparo, who was connected to British pirate Samuel McMorren (also known as Juan Bron). That week he also led the capture of John, an American schooner. Out of Newburyport and captained by Daniel Knight, on its way to Mayagüez the ship was intercepted by a ten-ton schooner armed with a swivel gun near Desecheo Island. Cofresí's group, consisting of seven pirates armed with sabers and muskets, stole $1,000 in cash, tobacco, tar and other provisions and the vessel's square rig and <b>mainsail.</b> Cofresí ordered the crew to head for Santo Domingo, threatening to kill everyone aboard if they were seen at any Puerto Rican port. Despite the threat, Knight went to Mayagüez and reported the incident.|$|E
500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, but never mind my leg: take care of my flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her <b>mainsail</b> and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 the Sou’wester {{sailboat}} was created. 62 original Sou’Westers were built, {{making it}} the largest fleet of single design cruising boats of its time. During the 1950s, Hinckley began experimenting {{with the use of}} fiberglass to construct his yachts’ hulls. His first fiberglass boat, the Bermuda 40 sailing ship, was released in 1959. The last Hinckley-built wooden boat was the 1960 “Osprey.” Throughout the 1960s the company provided navigation systems along with auto-pilot and electric-powered furling <b>mainsails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Radial sails have {{panels that}} [...] "radiate" [...] from corners {{in order to}} {{efficiently}} transmit stress and are typically higher-performance than cross-cut sails. A bi-radial sail has panels radiating from two of three corners; a tri-radial sail has panels radiating from all three corners. <b>Mainsails</b> {{are more likely to}} be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) {{are more likely to be}} tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners.|$|R
