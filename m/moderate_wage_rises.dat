50|$|The Callaghan Government also {{introduced}} {{a range of}} measures aimed at <b>moderating</b> pressures for <b>wage</b> <b>rises</b> {{and to create a}} favourable climate “for an orderly restoration of collective bargaining.” These included the granting of family income supplements to bring the incomes of lower-paid workers up to the level of social security benefits, the lowering of marginal tax rates on smaller incomes by rises in personal allowances, and increases in children’s allowances (which were payable to the mother). However, child tax allowances were lowered, which had the effect of reducing the take home pay of fathers. The impact of consumer price rises was also mitigated by higher income limits for free school meals, an increased milk subsidy, and a substantial reduction in the duty on petrol. In addition, electricity prices were lowered for families in receipt of supplementary benefits.|$|R
30|$|The {{decline in}} unit labor costs in Germany is related, among other things, to the {{behavior}} of social partners.

30|$|An often {{mentioned}} {{reason for}} {{the decline in the}} labor income share is that <b>wages</b> <b>rise</b> very slowly due to the large pool of surplus labor in the rural area. This is not a real reason. If <b>wages</b> <b>rise</b> more slowly than productivity, employment will rise quickly. These two effects cancel each other and do not affect the labor income share if the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital is one. Using the firm level data in industry, we find that the elasticity is indeed not significantly different from one.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a model where individual workers bargain with firms over their wages and where their bargaining power {{is so strong}} that some workers are unemployed. The result is that an increase in the elasticity of demand facing individual firms raises employment (as in the case where the labor market clears) but that <b>wages</b> <b>rise</b> only modestly. In fact, consistent with the findings of Wilson (1997), some job-specific wages actually fall. Nonetheless, average <b>wages</b> may <b>rise</b> either because <b>wages</b> of non-rationed workers rise or because there is cyclical upgrading of jobs. Assuming that workers are also rationed in financial markets, the increase in employment that accompanies the increase in the demand elasticity for individual products also increases consumption substantially. Thus, the model rationalizes the finding that real <b>wages</b> <b>rise</b> less in booms than does consumption. At the same time, the model is consistent with a lack of secular movements in hours and unemployment as well as a secular proportionality of consumption and real wages. ...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the scope}} of {{empirical}} research is limited, the focus is typically on wage and employment effects.

40|$|Wage Policies and Employment under Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates. - Under {{flexible}} {{exchange rates}} <b>moderate</b> <b>wage</b> policies lead to increased employment via an interaction between profitability and real-balance effects. The employment increase, which results from a lower nominal wage increase, is smaller than under fixed exchange rates. The reason for this difference is that <b>moderate</b> <b>wage</b> policies under fixed exchange rates cause an additional expansion in the money supply, thereby increasing the employment effects of the wage policies. If expectations vis- 0 -vis price and exchange rate changes are taken into consideration, it is not impossible that a small increase in domestic wages will cause a decrease in inflation expectations {{and an increase in}} the demand for the domestic currency. A drop in real demand thereby induced, could be counteracted by a monetary policy aiming at ensuring that the target inflation rate is not undershot...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} North America {{have found that}} {{although}} minimum wages have little effect on employment, they tend to reduce job turnover rates. Using individual-level data, evidence consistent with this is found for the U. K. The minimum wage is found to reduce both the likelihood of an employed worker leaving his/her current job {{and the likelihood of}} an unemployed worker entering employment. Most of the job separation effect is due to workers changing jobs rather than exiting employment, which suggests that it is primarily explained by employed workers reducing their proclivity to quit when their current <b>wage</b> <b>rises.</b> Using pseudo-panel data at the industry/region level, further evidence is found that hiring and separation rates fall when the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>rises...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper applies {{principles}} from {{evolutionary biology}} {{to the study}} of unions. We show that unions which maximize the present discounted wages of current members will be displaced in evolutionary competition by unions with more <b>moderate</b> <b>wage</b> policies that allow their firms to live longer. This suggests that unions with constitutional incumbency advantages that allow leaders to <b>moderate</b> members' <b>wage</b> demands may have a selective advantage. The model also suggests that industries with high turnover of firms will have low unionization rates, and that there may be one equilibrium with high unionization and long-lived firms and another with low unionization and short-lived firms. These predictions seem broadly consistent with the data. ...|$|R
