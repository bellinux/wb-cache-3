50|$|Over 1000 {{species of}} Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) have been {{recorded}} at Minsmere. The 32 recorded butterfly species include the silver-studded blue, the Camberwell beauty and the Queen of Spain fritillary. In September 2004 the moth species Catocala conjuncta, previously unrecorded in Britain, {{was found on the}} reserve. To acknowledge its place of capture it was given the common name <b>Minsmere</b> <b>crimson</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Catocala promissa, {{the light}} <b>crimson</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of the Erebidae family. The species {{can be found}} in Europe and Anatolia up to Armenia.|$|R

50|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna of {{the reserve}} has been surveyed in detail in 2002 and 2012, and surveyors found a rich and diverse fauna {{with an abundance of}} ancient woodland associated species. A total of 650 species have been identified and the reserve is now known to be of SSSI quality for saproxylic invertebrates (dead wood specialists). Of special interest is the rare fungus weevil Pseudeuparius sepicola, a Red Data Book species. The nationally scarce wood-cricket Nemobius sylvestris is very common in Briddlesford Copse and a population of the ash-black slug (Limax cinereoniger) was also recently discovered at the reserve - the largest terrestrial slug in the world. The rides and railway cuttings also provide a valuable habitat for a variety of woodland butterflies including silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the dark <b>crimson</b> <b>underwing</b> moth (Catocala sponsa).|$|R
