40|$|The quality {{assurance}} system for semi-industrial production scale of <b>multichip</b> <b>hybrid</b> circuits is presented. The hybrids are parts of the silicon strip detector modules of the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) of the forthcoming ATLAS detector. The edcap hybrid houses the readout and data transmission ASICs, providing the full functionality needed for binary readout of double-sided silicon strip detector modules. The hybrids are assembled in the industry using pretested components. The full {{quality assurance}} testing, including visual inspection, electrical testing and burn-in tests, is performed in the institutes of the SCT collaboration. The testing procedures and test results are presented. I...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{maximization}} in <b>multichip</b> <b>hybrid</b> pixel sensors is {{a crucial}} issue in large volume productions planned for future High-Energy Physics experiments. Bump bonding process optimization can guarantee statistical single bump failure rates at the acceptable level of 10 – 100 ppm; nevertheless, systematic effects connected to process repeatability can affect the functionality of a full chip in a module to a much larger extent. Because of this, the reversibility of the bonding procedure has been investigated. A feasibility study on single chip assemblies for the ATLAS experiment has been successfully completed, proving the possibility of reworking. As a result of it, a dedicated facility has been conceptually designed, engineered and commissioned. The characteristics of the facility in terms of motion, temperature and tensile strength control are outlined, together with the main results...|$|E
40|$|Direct Digital Synthesis {{technique}} is fast evolving and {{is becoming a}} key point {{in the design of}} advanced communication equipments. The growing interest in the use of such a type of {{technique is}} strictly related to the increase of speed and bandwidth in the components and the corresponding achievement of attractive performance in terms of frequency resolution and spectral purity. The increase in the synthesised bandwidth forces the use of very high speed technologies and the use of gallium arsenide devices becomes mandatory to obtain the required performance. The gallium arsenide technology has been playing since many years ago a key role in high-speed analog communication, electronic warfare and analog MMICs but in the recent past has become an astounding weapon also for digital applications. Furthermore processes which combine low-power RF analog and LSI digital functions are now available and they represents a valid alternative to using discrete-components and <b>multichip</b> <b>hybrids</b> for low-power microwave designs. After a brief review of the DDS concept the paper describes the basic design of the Gallium arsenide numerically controlled oscillator which is the key element of the DDS chain. The experimental results are shown with a particular attention to the spectral purity performance and the modulation capability. The trend of the future on-board applications is given with emphasis on the projects in which Alenia Spazio is presently reusing this specific development...|$|R
50|$|The main {{vehicle for}} testing of high {{reliability}} flatpack packages has been MIL-PRF-38534 (General Specification for Hybrid Microcircuits). This document outlines the general requirements of fully assembled devices, {{whether they are}} single chip, <b>multichip,</b> or of <b>hybrid</b> technology. The test procedures of these requirements are found in MIL-STD-883 (Test Methods and Procedures for Microelectronics) as a listing of test methods. These methods cover {{various aspects of the}} minimum requirements that a microelectronics device must be able to attain before it is considered a compliant device.|$|R
5000|$|The MIL-STD-883 {{standard}} establishes uniform methods, controls, {{and procedures}} for testing microelectronic devices suitable for use within military and aerospace electronic systems including basic environmental tests to determine resistance to deleterious effects of natural elements and conditions surrounding military and space operations; mechanical and electrical tests; workmanship and training procedures; and such other controls and constraints as have been deemed necessary to ensure a uniform level of quality and reliability suitable to the intended applications of those devices. For {{the purpose of this}} standard, the term [...] "devices" [...] includes such items as monolithic, <b>multichip,</b> film and <b>hybrid</b> microcircuits, microcircuit arrays, and the elements from which the circuits and arrays are formed. This standard is intended to apply only to microelectronic devices.|$|R
40|$|To enjoy {{working in}} manufacturing, {{one needs to}} be {{comfortable}} with chaos. In fact, it is best if one can thrive on chaos and constant motion. Two years after joining Hewlett Packard as a research and development engineer, I transferred to manufacturing into a production manager role. I went from responsibility for {{a small piece of}} a larger project to managing close to 100 people in a 24 -hour-a-day, 7 -days-a-week operation manufacturing light-emitting diodes (LEDs). I was responsible for the operators in three distinct areas—bulk crystal growth, epitaxial growth, and wafer fabrication. After production management for two years, I became a process engineering manager at the Colorado Springs Technology Center of Agilent Technologies (formerly Hewlett Packard). The Tech Center designs and manufactures <b>multichip</b> modules and <b>hybrid</b> assemblies for Agilent Technologies instruments...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic electrical-thermal {{modeling}} simulation {{technique was}} developed to allow up-front design of thermal and electronic packaging {{with a high degree}} of accuracy and confidence. We are developing a <b>hybrid</b> <b>multichip</b> module output driver which controls with power MOSFET driver circuits. These MOSFET circuits will dissipate from 13 to 26 watts per driver in a physical package less than two square inches. The power dissipation plus an operating temperature range of - 55 {degrees} C to 100 {degrees} C makes an accurate thermal package design critical. The project goal was to develop a simulation process to dynamically model the electrical/thermal characteristics of the power MOSFETS using the SABER analog simulator and the ABAQUS finite element simulator. SABER would simulate the electrical characteristics of the multi-chip module design while co-simulation is being done with ABAQUS simulating the solid model thermal characteristics of the MOSFET package. The dynamic parameters, MOSFET power and chip temperature, would be actively passed between simulators to effect a coupled simulator modelling technique. The project required a development of a SABER late for the analog ASIC controller circuit, a dynamic electrical/thermal template for the IRF 150 and IRF 9130 power MOSFETs, a solid model of the multi-chip module package, FORTRAN code to handle I/Q between and HP 755 workstation and SABER, and I/O between CRAY J 90 computer and ABAQUS. The simulation model was certified by measured electrical characteristics of the circuits and real time thermal imaging of the output multichip module...|$|R
