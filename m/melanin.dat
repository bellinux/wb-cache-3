40|$|<b>Melanins</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} pigments in animals and are involved in visual communication by producing colored traits that often evolve as intraspecific sig-nals of quality. Identifying and quantifying <b>melanins</b> are therefore essential to understand the function and evolution of melanin-based signals. However, the analysis of <b>melanins</b> is difficult due to their insolubility {{and the lack of}} simple methods that allow the identification of their chemical forms. We recently pro-posed the use of Raman spectroscopy as a simple, noninvasive technique {{that can be used to}} identify and quantify <b>melanins</b> in feathers and hairs. Contrarily, other authors later stated that <b>melanins</b> are characterized by a lack of defined Raman signals. Here, we use confocal Raman microscopy to confirm previous analyses showing that the two main chemical forms of <b>melanins</b> (eumelanin and pheomel-anin) exhibit distinct Raman signal and compare different excitation wavelengths to analyze synthetic pheomelanin and natural <b>melanins</b> in feathers of different species of birds.

40|$|Pneumocystis {{continues}} to represent an important opportunistic fungal pathogen {{of those with}} compromised immunity. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} identify factors that affect its viability and pathogenicity. We previously reported the first identification of <b>melanins</b> in Pneumocystis. In the present study, we sought to further characterize these components and define the function for these <b>melanins.</b> <b>Melanins</b> extracted from Pneumocystis and melanized Pneumocystis cells were analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, revealing spectra consistent with <b>melanins</b> from other fungi. Immunofluorescence assays using anti-melanin monoclonal antibodies showed that <b>melanins</b> are widely present across Pneumocystis host species, including mouse-, ferret-, and human-derived Pneumocystis organisms, as well as Pneumocystis carinii derived from rat. Using immunoelectron microscopy, <b>melanins</b> were found to localize to the cell wall and cytoplasm of P. carinii cysts, as well as to intracystic bodies within mature cysts. Next, the role of <b>melanins</b> on the maintenance of Pneumocystis viability was determined by using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR measurement of the heat shock protein mRNA under adverse environmental conditions. Using a new method to promote the melanization of Pneumocystis, we observed that strongly melanized Pneumocystis retained viability to a greater degree when exposed to UV irradiation or desiccation compared to less-pigmented organisms. These studies support our previous identification of Pneumocystis <b>melanins</b> across the genus, further characterize these Pneumocystis components, and demonstrate that <b>melanins</b> protect Pneumocystis from environmental stressors...|$|R
40|$|The fungal {{pathogens}} Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum produce melanin-like pigments in {{the presence}} of l-dopa in vitro and during mammalian infection. We investigated whether melanization affected the susceptibilities of the fungi to amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, or flucytosine (5 FC). Using the standard macrodilution MIC protocol (the M 27 A protocol) of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for yeast, we found no difference in the susceptibilities of melanized and nonmelanized C. neoformans and H. capsulatum isolates. Killing assays demonstrated that melanization reduced the susceptibilities of both fungi to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Laccase-deficient C. neoformans cells grown with l-dopa were significantly more susceptible than congenic melanin-producing yeast to killing by amphotericin B or caspofungin. Preincubation of amphotericin B or caspofungin with <b>melanins</b> decreased their antifungal activities. Elemental analysis of <b>melanins</b> incubated with amphotericin B or caspofungin revealed an alteration in the C:N ratios of the <b>melanins,</b> which indicated binding of these drugs by the <b>melanins.</b> In contrast, incubation of fluconazole, itraconazole, or 5 FC with <b>melanins</b> did not significantly affect the antifungal efficacies of the drugs or the chemical composition of the <b>melanins.</b> The results suggest a potential explanation for the inefficacy of caspofungin against C. neoformans in vivo, despite activity in vitro. Furthermore, the results indicate that fungal <b>melanins</b> protect C. neoformans and H. capsulatum from the activities of amphotericin B and caspofungin and that this protection is not demonstrable by standard broth macrodilution assays...|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of a horse's skin, eye, and coat-color is determined by pigment chemicals called <b>melanins.</b> Two types of <b>melanins</b> are used by mammals, such as horses and humans: eumelanin, which is visually black to brown, and phaeomelanin, visually red to yellow.

5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of <b>melanin,</b> known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The <b>melanin</b> that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} {{opposite}} of albinism. An unusually {{high level of}} <b>melanin</b> pigmentation (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{quantification}} of <b>melanins</b> is {{a complex}} task due to the chemical heterogeneity of the pigments {{and the difficulty of}} their isolation. The best accepted procedure currently consists in the chemical cleavage of <b>melanins</b> and the subsequent detection of degradation products by HPLC, which implies the destruction of samples. Here, we show that Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique {{that can be used to}} quantify <b>melanins.</b> We made parallel analyses of the characteristics of pheomelanin and eumelanin Raman spectra as measured by confocal Raman microscopy and of degradation products of pheomelanin (4 -amino- 3 -hydroxyphenylalanine, 4 -AHP) and eumelanin (pyrrole- 2, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid, PTCA) as measured by HPLC in feathers of red-legged partridges and hairs of wild boars and humans. We found strong correlations between the spectral Raman characteristics and 4 -AHP and PTCA levels, which indicates that the Raman spectra of <b>melanins</b> can be used to determine their content. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40|$|Birds exhibit an {{extraordinary}} diversity of plumage pigmentation patterns. It has been overlooked, however, that complex patterns {{can be produced}} only with the contribution of <b>melanins</b> because these are the only pigments under direct cellular control. We tested this hypothesis {{for the first time}} examining the plumage patterning of all species of extant birds. Thirty-two percent of species show complex plumage patterns, the vast majority (98 %) including the contribution of colors produced by <b>melanins.</b> Only 53 species show complex patterns that do not contain melanin-based colors, and these species display unusual colorations and belong to three families where innovative metabolic modifications of conventional carotenoid pigments have been described.

40|$|Hair is {{a uniquely}} {{mammalian}} trait with important functions, most easily appreciated in furred mammals. Our {{skin and hair}} color contribute very significantly to our overall visual appearance by highlighting striking variations between human sub-groups. Although <b>melanins,</b> hemoglobins, and carotenoids define the color perceived at the skin surface, our hair color relies only on {{the presence or absence}} of different <b>melanins.</b> The hair shaft's physical aspects provide only minor color modification. Various selective evolutionary pressures have determined that within the context of our specific ethnic backgrounds a bewildering array of natural shades are seen; ranging from yellows, reds, and browns to black and that harbinger of lost youth, gray/white hair. Skin/hair follicle <b>melanins</b> are formed in cytoplasmic organelles called melano-somes produced by neural crest-derived pigment cells called melano-cytes and are the product of a complex, phylogenetically ancient, biochemical pathway called melano-genesis.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{synthetic}} <b>melanins,</b> melanin-like polymers and melanin-based copolymers have {{been the focus of}} growing attention as soft biocompatible functional materials for engineering high performance, low cost optoelectronic devices, such as memory devices, light emitting diodes and field effect transistors. The unique combination of physicochemical properties of <b>melanins,</b> such as broad band absorption in the UV-visible range, intrinsic free radical character, water-dependent hybrid ionic-electronic conductor behaviour and excellent biocompatibility, have inspired use of melanic polymers as valuable functional materials for organic bioelectronics.

50|$|<b>Melanins</b> are {{produced}} in organelles called melanosomes. The production of <b>melanins</b> is called melanogenesis. Melanosomes {{are found in}} specialized pigment cells called melanocytes, but may also be engulfed by other cells, which are then called melanophages. Hair acquires pigment from melanocytes in the root bulb, which deposit melanosomes into the growing hair structure. A critical step {{in the production of}} <b>melanins</b> is the catalysis of tyrosine by an enzyme called tyrosinase, producing dopaquinone. Dopaquinone may become eumelanin, or phaeomelanin. Eumelanin, meaning true black, is a dense compound that absorbs most wavelengths of light, and appears black or brown as a result. Phaeomelanin, meaning rufous-black, is characterized by the presence of sulfur-containing cysteine, and it appears reddish to yellowish as a result. Melanosomes containing eumelanin are eumelanosomes, while those containing phaeomelanin are phaeomelanosomes. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) binds to the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and commits melanocytes to the production of eumelanin. In the absence of this signal, melanocytes produce phaeomelanin. Another chemical, Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), can attach itself to MC1R and interfere with MSH/MC1R signalling. In many mammals, variation in the level of ASP switches melanocytes between eumelanin and phaeomelanin production, resulting in coloured patterns.|$|R
40|$|<b>Melanins</b> are {{a family}} of {{heterogeneous}} polymeric pigments that provide ultraviolet (UV) light protection, structural support, coloration, and free radical scavenging. Formed by oxidative oligomerization of catecholic small molecules, the physical properties of <b>melanins</b> are influenced by covalent and noncovalent disorder. We report the use of tyrosine-containing tripeptides as tunable precursors for polymeric pigments. In these structures, phenols are presented in a (supra-) molecular context dictated by {{the positions of the}} amino acids in the peptide sequence. Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in peptide sequence-encoded properties such as UV absorbance, morphology, coloration, and electrochemical properties over a considerable range. Short peptides have low barriers to application and can be easily scaled, suggesting near-term applications in cosmetics and biomedicine...|$|R
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment <b>melanin,</b> and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of <b>melanin</b> in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E

Secondaries are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest.

5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of <b>melanin</b> pigment. Bears however have a single type of <b>melanin</b> and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E
