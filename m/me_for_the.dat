5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|If Mussorgsky's {{compositions}} {{are destined}} to live unfaded for fifty years after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, {{and not for the}} mere studying of his personality and artistic sins.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cambridge University in 1987 {{and working in}} {{advertising}} for three years, Langan joined Granada Television's drama serials department where she script edited daytime soap operas. From there, she transferred to Granada's newly created comedy department, where she developed the acclaimed television series Cold Feet, and other one-off comedies. In 2000, she left Granada to become a freelance producer, and produced the romantic comedy series Rescue <b>Me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BBC.

25|$|Marxian {{economics}} {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena.

What did the world want <b>me</b> <b>for?</b> <b>The</b> title {{made me think of}} an entire generation of Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Hernandez found {{serialization}} {{an impediment}} {{to the type of}} storytelling he was attempting with Poison River. [...] Since its completion, he has chosen to serialize certain works, such as Julio's Day (2012) and <b>Me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Unknown in the second volume of Love and Rockets; and to publish others as stand-alone graphic novels, such as Sloth (2006) and Chance in Hell (2007).

500|$|The “biggest” of {{the four}} soldiers, Sam {{is known for his}} child-like personality. He befriends a young Italian boy, Angelo Torancelli, and becomes a father figure to the child. Sam is first to {{discover}} a finely carved statue head, the Head of the Primavera, which he believes to carry magical powers. Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee. He fought hard to win the role of Sam, which resulted in him physically preparing for the part: “My physical prep was a little different than everybody else’s, because Spike wanted <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movie, but he told me I had to lose weight to do it. I had nine weeks to lose 60 pounds. We got it done.” ...|$|E
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together.

She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
