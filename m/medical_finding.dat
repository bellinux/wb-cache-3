40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to present a novel method for fuzzy medical image {{retrieval}} (FMIR) using vector quantization (VQ) with fuzzy signatures in conjunction with fuzzy S-trees. In past times, a task of similar pictures searching was not based on searching for similar content (e. g. shapes, colour) of the pictures but on the picture name. There exist some methods for the same purpose, {{but there is still}} some space for development of more efficient methods. The proposed image retrieval system is used for finding similar images, in our case in the medical area - in mammography, in addition {{to the creation of the}} list of similar images - cases. The created list is used for assessing the nature of the finding - whether the <b>medical</b> <b>finding</b> is malignant or benign. The suggested method is compared to the method using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) instead of fuzzy signatures and fuzzy S-tree. The method with NCD is useful for the creation of the list of similar cases for malignancy assessment, but it is not able to capture the area of interest in the image. The proposed method is going to be added to the complex decision support system to help to determine appropriate healthcare according to the experiences of similar, previous cases.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prognosis}} for an abnormal <b>medical</b> <b>finding</b> {{is affected by}} both early detection and adherence to the presecribed schedule for follow-up examinations. In this study, we examined the time to follow up after an abnormal finding and determined the {{risk factors related to}} delays in follow up in a population-based screening program. Methods The study population consisted of patients who were newly diagnosed with gastric cancer through a gastric cancer screening program sponsored by the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) in 2005. Due to the skewed nature of the distribution of time to follow up, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) are presented, and we analyzed the number of days preceding the follow-up time as a binary variable (≤ 90 days or > 90 days). We used logistic regression analyses to evaluate the risk factors for a long delay. Results The median number of days to follow-up initiation after an abnormal finding was 11 (IQR 7 – 27); 13. 9 % of the patients with gastric cancer obtained their follow-up evaluation more than 90 days. Age, type of health insurance, screening method, and screening results were risk factors for delays in follow up. Conclusions This study examined delays {{from the time of the}} discovery of an abnormal finding to time of the follow-up evaluation. Because inadequate follow up of abnormal exam results undermines the potential benefits of cancer screening, it is important to organize services that minimize delays between cancer screening and treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{a web-based}} {{software}} architecture and framework for management and diagnosis of {{large amounts of}} medical data in an ophthalmologic reading center is proposed. Data management for multi-center studies requires merging of standing data and repeatedly gathered clinical evidence such as vital signs and raw data. If ophthalmologic questions are involved the data acquisition is often provided by non-medical staff {{at the point of}} care or a study center, whereas the <b>medical</b> <b>finding</b> is mostly provided by an ophthalmologist in a specialized reading center. The study data such as participants, cohorts and measured values are administrated at a single data center for the entire study. Since a specialized reading center maintains several studies, the medical staff must learn the different data administration for the different data center. With respect to the increasing number and sizes of clinical studies, two aspects must be considered. At first, an efficient software framework is required to support the data management, processing and diagnosis by medical experts at the reading center. In the second place, this software needs a standardized user-interface that has not to be trained/taylore /adapted for each new study. Furthermore different aspects of quality and security controls have to be included. Therefore, the objective of this work is to establish a multi purpose ophthalmologic reading center, which can be connected to different data centers via configurable data interfaces in order to treat various topics simultaneously...|$|E
