Junji Ito's initial desire was to create a story about strange changes that would occur to people living in a very long, traditional Japanese terraced house. This story would have been based on Ito's personal experience living in such a house as a child. During the process of finding a way to draw such a long building, Ito was inspired by the shape of a <b>mosquito</b> <b>coil</b> and decided he could make the building long by having it spiral. Ito has noted that the spiral is a [...] "mysterious pattern" [...] and described writing Uzumaki as an attempt to learn the secrets of the spiral. Ito sought inspiration by methods such as staring at spirals, researching spirals, creating spiral patterns by draining water from bath tubs, eating foods with spiral patterns, and raising snails. Looking back on the series in 2006, Ito stated that while he was still uncertain what the spiral stood for, he thought it might be representative of infinity.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{mosquito}}</b> <b>coil</b> is {{a mosquito}} repelling incense, usually {{made into a}} spiral, and typically made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder. The coil is usually held {{at the center of}} the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of fireproof netting to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the outer end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the center of the spiral, producing a mosquito-repellent smoke.

This practice is currently used in numerous households in Asia, Africa, and South America. However, the smoke may contain pollutants of health concern. We conducted {{the present study}} to characterize the emissions from four common brands of <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> from China and two common brands from Malaysia. We used mass balance equations to determine emission rates of fine particles (particulate matter < 2. 5 µm in diameter; PM 2. 5), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aldehydes, and ketones. Having applied these measured emission rates to predict indoor concentrations under realistic room conditions, we found that pollutant concentrations resulting from burning <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> could substantially exceed health-based air quality standards or guidelines. Under the same combustion conditions, the tested Malaysian <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> generated more measured pollutants than did the tested Chinese <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils.</b> We also identified a large suite of volatile organic compounds, including carcinogens and suspected carcinogens, in the coil smoke.

50|$|<b>Mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> are {{considered}} to be safe insecticides for humans and mammals, although some studies highlight concerns when they are used in closed rooms. Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. Other studies in rats conclude that <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> are not a significant health risk, although some organisms may experience temporary sensory irritation like that caused by smoke from the combustion of organic materials such as logs. In one study, rats were directly exposed to a coil's smoke for six hours a day, five days a week for thirteen weeks. They showed signs of sensory irritation from the high smoke concentration, but there were no adverse effects on other parts of the body.

The annual worldwide consumption {{of the four major}} types of residential insecticide products [...] aerosols, <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils,</b> liquid vaporizers, and vaporizing mats [...] is in the billions of units. <b>Mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> are burned indoors and outdoors in East Asia and to a limited extent {{in other parts of the}} world, including the United States.

The number of coil users in China is in the millions. In Indonesia alone, an estimated seven billion coils are purchased annually. Coils containing pyrethroid insecticides, particularly d-allethrin, may contain octachlorodipropyl ether (S- 2, S- 421) as a synergist or active ingredient. Use of those coils likely exposes children and adults to some level of bis(chloromethyl) ether (BCME).

All household members were recruited to the study, with only those households excluded with pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, members with chest complaints or allergies or members that regularly slept away from home. The main outcome of interest was Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence detected by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) during six repeated monthly cross-sectional surveys.

5000|$|In 2002, the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} an article that found products containing essential oils such as catnip or geranium oil, when combined with a suitable carrier oil such as soybean, {{have been found to}} be effective as natural repellents. This was based on testing done by Johns Hopkins and Cornell Universities. Other commercial products offered for household mosquito [...] "control" [...] include small electrical mats, mosquito repellent vapor, DEET-impregnated wrist bands, mosquito fogging, and <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> containing a form of the chemical allethrin. Mosquito-repellent candles containing citronella oil are sold widely in the U.S. These have been used with mixed reports of success and failure.|$|R

These products dominate the pest control market; therefore, {{it is vital}} to characterize mosquito responses elicited by the chemical actives and their potential for disease prevention. The aim of this review was to determine effects of <b>mosquito</b> <b>coils</b> and emanators on mosquito responses that reduce human-vector contact and to propose scientific consensus on terminologies and methodologies used for evaluation of product formats that could contain spatial chemical actives, including indoor residual spraying (IRS), long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and insecticide treated materials (ITMs). PubMed, (National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U. S. National Library of Medicine, NIH), MEDLINE, LILAC, Cochrane library, IBECS and Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System search engines were used to identify studies of pyrethroid based coils and emanators with key-words "Mosquito coils" "Mosquito emanators" and "Spatial repellents". It was concluded that there is need to improve statistical reporting of studies, and reach consensus in the methodologies and terminologies used through standardized testing guidelines. Despite differing evaluation methodologies, data showed that coils and emanators induce mortality, deterrence, repellency as well as reduce the ability of mosquitoes to feed on humans. Available data on efficacy outdoors, dose-response relationships and effective distance of coils and emanators is inadequate for developing a target product profile (TPP), which will be required for such chemicals before optimized implementation can occur for maximum benefits in disease control...|$|R
