50|$|As most fashion {{magazines}} and home economics magazines {{from the first}} half of the 20th century attest, tatting had a substantial following. When fashion included feminine touches such as lace collars and cuffs, and inexpensive yet nice baby shower gifts were needed, this creative art flourished. As the fashion moved to a more modern look and technology <b>made</b> <b>lace</b> an easy and inexpensive commodity to purchase, hand-made lace began to decline.|$|R

60|$|He {{became a}} member of a little Baptist society, and soon began to preach. Crowds came to hear him, drawn by his earnest spirit and his quaint {{striking}} manner. But when Charles the Second became king, no religious services were allowed except those of the Church of England, and all other meetings were forbidden. Bunyan however went on preaching, until he was sent to prison in Bedford. In Bedford jail he stayed twelve years. To find a means of living in jail, he <b>made</b> <b>lace,</b> and sold it as a support for himself and his blind daughter.|$|R

He seems to have formed business partnerships, buying <b>made</b> <b>lace</b> goods and selling them on to wholesale and retail customers. In the mid-1830s, he was shown in local business directories as a lace manufacturer.

The women <b>made</b> <b>lace</b> and took in laundry, which they washed in the hot springs. The men carved wood and manufactured saddle pads for horses. They also raised cattle and cultivated 200 acre of land. In 1880, after numerous suits and countersuits, European-American John G.

50|$|The {{popularity}} of napkin holders corresponded with the invention (and popularization) {{of the paper}} napkin by the Scott Paper Company in 1930, although cloth napkins had existed - often as handkerchiefs - since Greek and Roman times. Wrought iron napkin holders and rings were a common part of a blacksmith's repertoire during the 19th century {{as well as other}} holders and household items. <b>Mechanically</b> <b>made</b> napkin holders have replaced many of those made by hand, as blacksmithing is now primarily an art form, as opposed to a means of creation of household utility items.|$|R

50|$|The reticella was {{the design}} {{that was the}} {{catalyst}} of the transition between fabrics <b>made</b> into <b>lace</b> by subtracting threads after needling, and <b>lace</b> <b>made</b> from scratch without fabric support. The reticella design required one to draw out threads after stitching onto fabric. As that design evolved, {{an increasing number of}} threads required withdrawing. Eventually, so many threads were drawn-out that the foundation became very flimsy and lace makers devised a new framework that did not require original foundation fabric. This {{came to be known as}} punto in aria.|$|R

In the fabrication of perfumes for the pouncet box, and sweetmeats prepared with honey and sugar, she proved to have a dainty hand, so that Lambert, who would not touch her jewels, declared that she was fully earning her maintenance by the assistance that she gave to him.|$|R

I identify the different cultural identities that arise from new developments, higher standard of living, and increased consumer culture.

5000|$|In the 19th century a new wig-making method {{began to}} replace the weft method most {{commonly}} used prior. A small hook called a [...] "ventilating needle", similar to the tambour hooks used for decorating fabric with chain-stitch embroidery at that period, is used to knot a few strands of hair at a time directly to a suitable foundation material. By the 1870s, the <b>lace</b> machine had <b>made</b> <b>lace</b> affordable through mass production {{and the use of}} lace as foundation material for wigs entered popular use. Using lace allowed for a more natural-looking wig because the flesh-colored lace is almost imperceptible. The more common use was a strip of lace just at the front, known as a lace front wig, which gives the impression of a natural hairline.|$|R
