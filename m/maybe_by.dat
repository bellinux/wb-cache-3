25|$|Certified {{four times}} {{platinum}} in the United Kingdom, {{in the year}} following its release the album came to define the emerging Britpop scene, along with the album Definitely <b>Maybe</b> <b>by</b> rivals Oasis. Britpop in turn would form {{the backbone of the}} broader Cool Britannia movement. Parklife therefore has attained a cultural significance above and beyond its considerable sales and critical acclaim, cementing its status as a landmark in British rock music. It has sold over five million copies worldwide.|$|E

Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis [...] "a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really.... He's not a comic guy.

Ask any middle-aged {{socially}} conscious intellectual {{to list the}} books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, {{and he or she}} will most likely mention The Autobiography of MalcolmX.

500|$|Castellaneta's normal {{speaking}} voice {{does not}} bear any resemblance to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin {{to his chest}} and is said to [...] "let his I.Q. go". While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments, such as the line [...] "I am so smart, s-m-r-t" [...] from [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and he tries to visualize a scene {{so that he can}} give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, [...] "except, <b>maybe,</b> <b>by</b> a die-hard fan".|$|E

500|$|Castellaneta is {{most famous}} {{for his role as}} Homer Simpson on the longest running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not [...] "get enough power behind that voice" [...] and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he [...] "dropped the voice down", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to [...] "let his IQ go." [...] Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it.

The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, Riding the Bullet, and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market [...] "probably by 2013 and <b>maybe</b> <b>by</b> 2012".

Its customers included not only royalty, such as Alfonso XIII of Spain (warrant granted in 1913); Edward VIII, duke of Windsor; the French president Paul Deschanel, noted for his elegant Charvet cravats; but also members of the high society gravitating around dandies such as Robert de Montesquiou and Evander Berry Wall, or artists as Jean Cocteau, who called Charvet [...] "magic" [...] and wrote that it is [...] "where the rainbow finds ideas", and his friend Sergei Diaghilev. According to Proust, whose shirts, ties and waistcoats were from Charvet, <b>maybe</b> <b>by</b> imitation of Montesquiou, the latter was [...] "the sign of a certain world, of a certain elegance". Proust also spent long moments at Charvet {{in search of a}} perfect tone for his cravats, such as a [...] "creamy pink". His tank tops ( [...] in French) also came from Charvet. In his Remembrance of Things Past (1919), Marcel, the narrator, waiting for the appointed hour of his lunch engagement at Swann's house, whiles away his time [...] "tightening from time to time the knot of [...] magnificent Charvet tie". In 1908, Charvet won a Grand Prix at the London Exhibition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pyramid shaped {{pyrolysis}} flame is a {{new method}} to synthesis carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Oxy-acetylene flame {{was used as the}} source of heat, CO as the source of carbon, and iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) as the source of catalyst. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to illustrate the experimental results. Our results show straight, uniform and high degree graphitization CNTs were produced whereas lots of deformity tubes were present, as bamboo-shaped tubes, filled tubes, diameter changed tubes, irregular tubes, etc. In order to understand the synthesis mechanism of deformity tube, many models were presented for the different shape tubes. Synthesizing bamboo-shaped tubes <b>maybe</b> decide <b>by</b> capillary siphon and the low melting state of catalyst particles. Besides capillary siphon and the low melting state of catalyst particles, filled tubes mainly connect with the continuous supply of catalyst atom clusters. The diameter changed tubes <b>maybe</b> influenced <b>by</b> the diameter changing of catalyst particles and the action of other materials. Irregular tubes <b>maybe</b> affect <b>by</b> temperature and other factors...|$|R

The sound and sight of this bird with its lively grey-blue eyes, so close and ardent, startled me. I leapt up, ran across the table, tripped over a hairbrush, and fell sprawling beside my father's watch. I hear its ticking, and also the little soothing whistle with which he was wont to comfort his daughter at any such mishap. Then perhaps I was five or six.|$|E

But as you did come, and as you were dragged away by those devils, I {{want you to know that}} all your wealth and position and influence--all that power behind you--would never have saved you from hell to-night.

That made it a sort of lottery for him, for if we never came back at all he would never have to pay, so he could afford to take his risks and offer me a good price. I reckon he thinks he has got them at a gift. He has given two pieces of paper, one for you and one for me, saying that he owes the two of us the money; so if I should go under and you should get back, you will draw it all right." ...|$|E
