The standard Sirdar class engines were similar to the single [...] gauge 2-4-2T engine Hope which had entered service in Walvis Bay in 1899, but without the leading and trailing pony wheels. Kerr, Stuart was a supplier of contractor's engines and often built locomotives to standard designs, but without frame stretchers and axles, and kept them in stock until an order was placed. This allowed them to be delivered with a minimum of delay.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{the river}} {{cross-section}} by <b>barrage</b> <b>construction</b> causes {{rises in the}} average river water levels and discharge rates in the rainy season. The time series patterns for groundwater levels measured at 23 riverside monitoring wells along the lower Nakdong River are compared for two cases: before and after water-filling at the Changnyeong-Haman Barrage. Monthly average groundwater levels indicate a distinct increase in groundwater levels in the upstream riverside close to the barrage. River-water level management by barrage gate control in August, during the rainy season, resulted in a 0. 1 m decrease in groundwater levels, while water-filling at the barrage in December caused a 1. 3 m increase in groundwater levels. The results of hierarchical cluster analysis indicate that seven groundwater monitoring wells and river water levels {{were in the same}} group before <b>barrage</b> <b>construction,</b> but that this number increased to 14 after <b>barrage</b> <b>construction.</b> Prin-cipal component analysis revealed that the explanation power of two principal components corresponding to river fluctu-ation, PC 1 and PC 2, was approximately 82 % before <b>barrage</b> <b>construction</b> but decreased to 45 % after construction. This finding indicates that the effect of the river level component that contributes to change in groundwater level, decrease...|$|R

One of the most {{prominent}} critics was the then Cardiff West MP, Rhodri Morgan (Labour), who was later to become First Minister of the Welsh Assembly. Morgan, like Thatcher, said that the scheme would cost too much money. It was reported by the Daily Mirror in March 2000 that the costs of the <b>barrage</b> <b>construction</b> alone had risen to £400 million, and there would be additional £12 million a year charge for maintenance and operation. Morgan said, [...] "This is far higher than was ever identified to Parliament during the passage of the Barrage Bill".|$|R

40|$|The {{impounding}} of estuaries {{is currently}} a popular approach to urban regeneration in the UK, with barrages constructed (Tees, Wansbeck, Tawe, Cardiff Bay, Lagan and Clyde) or proposed (Usk, Loughor, Neath, Hayle, Avonmouth and Ipswich) nationwide. Impounding fundamentally alters the dynamics of estuaries with consequences in terms of sedimentation patterns and rates, ecology, flooding, groundwater, etc. This thesis presents the findings from research into the effects of impounding on estuarine water quality. A series of surveys {{of a range of}} physical and chemical parameters were carried out within four estuaries representing the complete range of tidal modification by <b>barrage</b> <b>construction.</b> Internal versus external controls on water quality are distinguished. General water quality in estuarine impoundments is good, but significant problems occur where water bodies show entrenched density stratification, with anoxia and associated increases in ammonia and metal concentrations developing. Stratification related problems are worse in partial than total tidal exclusion impoundments (although a higher rate of tidal overtopping shortens the isolation periods of deep anoxic waters), and low water quality at depth is observed over the majority of the year. The potential for eutrophication is increased by <b>barrage</b> <b>construction,</b> although phosphorus (generally the limiting nutrient) is shown to be catchment sourced, with internal cycling from sediment insignificant. Sediment thickness is shown not to be a control on water quality, although sediment build-up over time eventually leads to a loss of amenity value. Sterol fingerprints are used to identify sewage inputs to the impoundments. Advice for barrage planners and designers is given, including the exclusion and removal of saline water, provision of destratification/aeration devices, control of nutrient inputs, and modelling of sediment loads and deposition. This study has shown that catchment management is fundamental in the sustainability of estuarine impoundments...|$|R

Regression analysis is used in measuring a contractor’s competitiveness between bids (by using the lowest bid / own bid ratio) and within bids (by using the lowest bid / cost estimate ratio) according to type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client type. The model was tested on a large and reputable Hong Kong contractor. This particular contractor's bidding behaviour was found to be largely unaffected by type of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> but significantly affected by client type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work.</b> Three quadratic models (regressing lowest bid / cost estimate on size of <b>construction</b> <b>work)</b> are also successfully developed for projects from the private sector, the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Housing Authority respectively...|$|R
