The first, the magnetic induction intensity model of any point in the cylindrical permanent magnet external was established based on the equivalent current model of permanent magnet. The second, the mathematical formula was derived using the Biot-Savart law and the superposition principle of magnetic field. Then its magnetic induction intensity was calculated by multiple numerical integration function of MATLAB, and the characteristics and distribution were obtained. On this basis, the simulation {{and analysis of the}} permanent magnet with height 7 mm and diameter 2 mm was finished. The results showed that the closer the field point was to the permanent magnet end face, the stronger the magnetic induction intensity was, and the magnetic induction intensity at the edge of end face was stronger than at the center.

A 100 % viscose twisted staple yarn was covered through an in-house developed process with a polymeric solution containing micrometric sized barium hexaferrite <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder.</b> The in-house developed process allows deposition of micrometric thickness polymeric paste layer on the yarn surface. Barium hexaferrite is a hard magnetic material exhibiting high chemical stability and corrosion resistivity, relatively large saturation and residual magnetization and microwave absorbing properties.

The concentration of <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder</b> in the polymeric solution has a direct influence on the coating amount, diameter and density.

The study mainly focused on diffusion, {{which is one}} of the transport mechanisms. The transport properties depend on many parameters like: polymeric matrix used, type of powder, its amount and granulation. The structure of the pattern formed by magnetic particles in the membrane matrix was studied. Description of the system was based on the phenomenological and molecular (random walk on a fractal lattice) approaches. Two parameters were calculated: the fractal dimension of random walk d_{w}, and the fractal dimension of membrane structure d_{f}. The knowledge of both parameters made it possible to use the generalized equation of diffusion on the fractal structure obtained by Metzler et al. The research was carried out to determine the influence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder</b> granulation on the transport properties.

Highly reflective <b>magnetic</b> <b>powders</b> {{have been available}} commercially for latent fingerprint development on dark background surfaces for a few years, however there are needs of a superior darker variety of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder</b> which would be ideally suitable for obtaining good contrast on light background surfaces. A novel dark <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder</b> is therefore suggested for the application in latent fingerprint development on light backgrounds. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the manufacturing techniques {{for the production of}} metallic powders and previous experiences, a series of dry milling trials were proposed using a high energy vibratory mill. In these milling trials, atomized iron powders of appropriate particle dimensions were chosen as the starting material. The starting atomized iron powders are mixed with a specific process controlling agent in cylindrical plastic pots, which are fixed on the vibratory mill. Stainless steel balls were used as the milling medium. The amount of starting iron powders and the milling time are designated so as to obtain flakes of different particle dimensions. After the designated milling process, the powders were carefully exposed to the air to avoid catching fire and separated from the steel balls. Thereafter, the samples of the powders were inspected using scan electron microscope and the result reveals that some good quality flakes with leafy characteristics and high aspect ratio were developed. The samples of the powders were also used to develop latent fingerprints on a common background at the university???s forensic investigation laboratory, and the result indicates that some flakes obtained can be considered as good quality darker variety of <b>magnetic</b> <b>powder</b> for fingerprint development...|$|R
