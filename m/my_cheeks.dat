25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern-first at position [...] Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: [...] "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and everyone around me was crying; {{it was a very}} sad sight." ...|$|E

He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not <b>my</b> <b>cheeks.</b> It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly {{felt that there}} was much about the album that should not work, including [...] "sickly-sweet vocals", [...] "theme-park-level arrangements" [...] and [...] "cheesy song choices". Despite this, she commented: [...] "When the Glee kids nail something—like a version of Van Halen's [...] "Jump" [...] that made <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> sore from smiling—the title of this joyful franchise could not be more apt." [...] Allmusic's Andrew Leahey observed that the soundtrack felt [...] "a bit rushed" [...] due to its release four weeks after Volume 1 and the fact it features songs from half as many episodes as the first album. He criticized: [...] "As before, this album sometimes strays away from choral arrangements and sounds more like a collection of karaoke recordings." [...] Overall, however, Leahey believed that returning fans would find the album enjoyable.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Loncraine's 1995 filmic {{adaptation}} of Richard Eyre's 1990 stage production of Richard III features considerably less material from 3 Henry VI than had Olivier's film. Starring Ian McKellen as Richard (reprising his role {{from the stage}} production), John Wood as Edward, Nigel Hawthorne as George and Annette Bening as Queen Elizabeth, the film begins prior to the Battle of Tewkesbury, with Henry VI (portrayed by Edward Jewesbury) still in power. The opening scene depicts Henry and his son Edward (played by Christopher Bowen) preparing for the forthcoming battle. However, a surprise attack is launched on their headquarters by Richard, and both are killed. This scene is without dialogue. The last line of 3 Henry VI is also used in the film; Edward's [...] "For here I hope begins our lasting joy" [...] appears as a subtitle after the coronation of Edward and is altered to read [...] "And now, they hope, begins their lasting joy", with [...] "they" [...] referring to the House of York. The film then moves on to the coronation of Edward IV (again without dialogue), before Richard delivers the opening speech of Richard III as an after-dinner toast to the new king. Like Olivier's film, Loncraine includes several characters in the coronation scene who are not present {{in the text of}} 3 Henry VI; Buckingham (played by Jim Broadbent), Richmond (played by Dominic West) and Elizabeth Plantagenet (played by Kate Steavenson-Payne). Richmond will later go on to be Henry VII, and Elizabeth (King Edward's daughter) will become his queen. As with Jane Shore, Elizabeth is mentioned several times in Richard III, although she never appears in the text. Loncraine's film also used a line from 3 Henry VI in its poster campaign – [...] "I can smile and murder whiles I smile" [...] (3.2.182), although [...] "whiles" [...] was changed to [...] "while." [...] This line is also included in the film – after Richard concludes his opening speech to Edward, he enters the men's room and continues in soliloquy form to line twenty-seven of Richard III before then referring back to the earlier play [...] "Why, I can smile and murder while I smile/And wet <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> with artificial tears/And frame my face to all occasions" [...] (ll. 182-185). The film then moves on to the arrest of George.|$|E
