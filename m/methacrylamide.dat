40|$|Multifunctional {{monomers}} on {{the basis}} of acryl- and methacryl derivatives were synthesized and different protective groups were used. After polymerization the protective groups were removed by different methods. Various initiators for the NMP of the monomers were synthesized and the reaction conditions were optimized. The results showed that NMP was not a suitable method for multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives to achieve well-defined homopolymers, although it was successful for control of polymerization of styrene and block copolymerization of multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives with alkoxyamine terminated polystyrene. The ATRP of multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates has been successfully performed, as well as the block copolymerization of multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates. Relatively low polydispersities of the corresponding polymers (PD= 1. 18 - 1. 36) and reasonably high rates of polymerization could be achieved when Me 6 TREN and PMDETA were used as ligands. However, the ATRP of multifunctional acrylamides and <b>methacrylamides</b> failed. The RAFT-polymerization of styrene, acrylamide and acrylate using BDTB as a CTA and AIBN as an initiator afforded polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution (PD= 1. 13 - 1. 26). A kinetic investigation and the further synthesis of block copolymers using dithioester-terminated homopolymers as macroCTAs showed that the RAFT polymerization of acrylamide M 9 b proceeded in a living manner. However, BDTB does not control the reaction of methacrylic monomers, such as methacrylates and <b>methacrylamides.</b> The bulk phase behavior of the block copolymers were examined by means of DSC and the surface behaviors of block copolymers as thin layers were examined with AFM. Two-phase transitions in the block copolymers were observed clearly by DSC, indicative of the appearance of phase separations, which were seen in an AFM image. In conclusion, multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives failed to achieve well-defined homopolymers by NMP. However, this method was successful for block copolymerization of multifunctional acryl- and methacryl derivatives with alkoxyamine terminated polystyrene. Multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates were successfully homopolymerized and block copolymerized by ATRP. Multifunctional acrylates and acrylamides were suitable for homopolymerization and block copolymerization by the RAFT process.

A series of amide monomers were synthesized by amidation of methacryloyl chloride with amines and grafted onto commercial poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes using irradiation from atmospheric pressure plasma (APP).

30|$|For {{the oil and}} gas industry, CO 2 EOR {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} as a feasible technology to improve oil recovery. The EOR mechanisms include interfacial tension (IFT) reduction, CO 2 dissolution into oil to reduce its viscosity and swell oil, permeability improvements as the reaction of carbonic acid (due to CO 2 dissolution in water) with the limestone/dolomite, and wettability alteration due to asphaltene precipitation. It is notable that CO 2 and oil may become miscible when the reservoir pressure exceeds the minimum miscible pressure (MMP) which can greatly reduce the residual oil saturation and improve oil recovery (Li et al. 2015). However, viscous fingering (due to the viscosity contrast of CO 2 and oil) and gravity segregation (due to the lower density of CO 2) can develop quickly and lead to lower macroscopic sweep efficiency during the process of CO 2 injection. Reservoir heterogeneity leads to more severe early breakthrough of CO 2 in production wells (Hamouda et al. 2009; Hou and Yue 2010; Enick et al. 2012). Early breakthrough of CO 2 at production wells can reduce the sweep efficiency and undermine the oil recovery factor (Chakravarthy et al. 2006; Nezhad et al. 2006). A key issue of CO 2 flooding is to mitigate the problem of gas channeling, especially for the reservoirs associated with high-permeability zones (thief zones) (Xing et al. 2010). Different techniques have been developed for blocking channels with high permeability and controlling the mobility of CO 2, such as the water-alternating-gas (WAG) process (Christensen et al. 2001; Luo et al. 2013; Majidaie et al. 2015), injection of CO 2 foam (Khalil and Asghari 2006; Yu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013 a), and use of CO 2 thickener (Enick et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011; Mclendon et al. 2012). However, the technologies mentioned above have their own limitations, for example technical feasibility, economy, environmental friendliness, and safety. Gel polymer systems have been applied successfully in oil and gas wells to control unwanted water production in recent years. A gel system consists of polymer, crosslinker, water as the solvent, and some additive materials. The polymers used in gel systems mainly include polyacrylamides (PAM), partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (PHPA), xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose, furfural alcohol, acrylic/epoxy resins, silicate based gels, and block copolymers. Meanwhile, the crosslinker can be classified into two groups: organic (such as phenol, formaldehyde, and polyethyleneimine (PEI)) and inorganic (such as Cr 3 +, Al 3 +, Zr 3 +) (Dalrymple et al. 1994; Prada 1998; Niu et al. 2013). For inorganically crosslinked gels, nanotechnology was used to extend the gelation time of PHPA/Cr 3 + systems (Cordova et al. 2008). The particles based on PEI and dextran sulfate (DS) can sequester Cr 3 +. In addition, PHPA/Cr 3 + system assisted by foam was evaluated to block deep wormholes (Asghari et al. 2005). Copolymers of PAM were also studied for crosslinking with Cr 3 + (Prada et al. 2000). Colloidal dispersion gels (CDGs) were investigated for blocking of “thief zones” in heterogeneous formations (Chang et al. 2006). With respect to the organically crosslinked gels, a system was designed by the PDVSA Research and Development Center that can exhibit blocking performance at temperature up to 160  °C. The PAtBA (PAM tert-butyl acrylate)/PEI system was developed for near-wellbore treatments, and it also can tolerate temperature up to 160  °C in fields. In order to enhance the strength of gels, materials were also added into the PAtBA/PEI system like cement, silica flour, and rigid-setting materials (RSMs). For the deep modification of injection profiles, two gel systems were identified: microspheres using PAM monomers crosslinked with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and microspheres produced by crosslinking 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) with diacrylamides and <b>methacrylamides</b> of diamines (El-Karsani et al. 2014). Polymer microsphere emulsion attracts considerable attention for water shutoff material with relatively low viscosity that can be injected continuously and prepared using formation water produced from oilfields (Guo et al. 2014). Preformed particle gels (PPGs) were also used to overcome different drawbacks, which include the uncertainty of gelling due to shear degradation and gelant composition changes caused by dilution by formation water and chromatographic fractionation, inevitable in situ gelation systems (Elsharafi and Bai 2016). Although generally gel treatment is performed with waterflooding for conformance control, several laboratory experiments and field applications have been conducted to divert CO 2 (Martin and Kovarik 1987; Martin et al. 1988; Seright 1995; Hughes et al. 1999; Karaoguz et al. 2007; Hou and Yue 2010; Pipes and Schoeling 2014). However, gelation time limits the application of this technology mentioned above. In matrix treatments, it must be long enough so that the gel can penetrate into the reservoir to ensure sufficiently deep placement. It is difficult to control the gelation time with various factors affecting it, such as temperature, salinity of mixing water, and concentration of polymer. Hence, new types of gel systems need to be developed for blocking the gas channeling during the CO 2 injection process with more reliable operation.|$|R

40|$|Biochemically {{modified}} proteins {{have attracted}} significant attention {{due to their}} widespread applications as biomaterials. For instance, chemically modified gelatin derivatives have been widely explored to develop hydrogels for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Among the reported methods, modification of gelatin with methacrylic anhydride (MA) stands out as a convenient and efficient strategy to introduce functional groups and form hydrogels via photopolymerization. Combining light-activation of modified gelatin with soft lithography has enabled the materialization of microfabricated hydrogels. So far, this gelatin derivative {{has been referred to}} in the literature as gelatin methacrylate, gelatin <b>methacrylamide,</b> or gelatin methacryloyl, with the same abbreviation of GelMA. Considering the complex composition of gelatin and the presence of different functional groups on the amino acid residues, both hydroxyl groups and amine groups can possibly react with methacrylic anhydride during functionalization of the protein. This can also apply to the modification of other proteins, such as recombinant human tropoelastin to form MA-modified tropoelastin (MeTro). Here, we employed analytical methods to quantitatively determine the amounts of methacrylate and <b>methacrylamide</b> groups in MA-modified gelatin and tropoelastin to better understand the reaction mechanism. By combining two chemical assays with instrumental techniques, such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) and liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), our results indicated that while amine groups had higher reactivity than hydroxyl groups and resulted in a majority of <b>methacrylamide</b> groups, modification of proteins by MA could lead to the formation of both <b>methacrylamide</b> and methacrylate groups. It is therefore suggested that the standard terms for GelMA and MeTro should be defined as gelatin methacryloyl and methacryloyl-substituted tropoelastin, respectively, to remain consistent with the widespread abbreviations used in literature...|$|E

40|$|New {{anti-infective}} {{materials are}} needed urgently as alternatives to conventional biocides. It {{has recently been}} established that polymer materials designed to bind {{to the surface of}} bacteria can induce the formation of cell clusters which enhance the expression of quorum sensing controlled phenotypes. These materials are relevant for anti-infective strategies as they have the potential to inhibit adhesion {{while at the same time}} modulating Quorum Sensing (QS) controlled virulence. Here we carefully evaluate the role that charge and catechol moieties in these polymers play on the binding. We investigate the ability of the cationic polymers poly(N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] <b>methacrylamide)</b> (pDMAPMAm, P 1), poly(N-dopamine methacrylamide-co-N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] <b>methacrylamide)</b> (pDMAm-co-pDMAPMAm, P 2) and p(3, 4 -dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine <b>methacrylamide),</b> p(l-DMAm, P 3) to cluster a range of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), Vibrio harveyi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) under conditions of varying pH (6, 7 and 8) and polymer concentration (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/mL). We identify that clustering ability is strongly dependent on the balance between charge and hydrophobicity. Moreover, our results suggest that catechol moieties have a positive effect on adhesive properties, but only in the presence of cationic residues such as for P 2. Overall, our results highlight the subtle interplay between dynamic natural surfaces and synthetic materials, as well as the need to consider synergistic structure–property relationship when designing antimicrobial polymers...|$|E
40|$|Two type of {{nitrogen}} containing pregelled starch derivatives having amide groups (CONH 2) {{were used in}} heavy metal ions removal from its solutions. These pregelled starch derivatives were carbamated pregelled starch (CPS) and poly (<b>methacrylamide)</b> -pregelled starch graft copolymer (PMamPSGC). Different factors affecting adsorption of metal ions onto these substrates such as metal ion concentration, pH, treatment time and temperature as well as type of starch derivatives were studied. Results obtained reflect the following findings: (a) the adsorption values of both nitrogen containing starch derivatives in question increase by increasing the metal ion concentration up to 50 mmol L - 1 then levels off, (b) poly (<b>methacrylamide)</b> -pregelled starch graft copolymer was selective adsorbent for Hg 2 + at pH 0. 5 - 1, (c) The adsorption values on these pregelled starch derivatives at different metal ions follow the order: Hg 2 + > Cu 2 + > Zn 2 + > Pb 2 +, (d) The adsorption efficiency % of metal ions in case of poly (<b>methacrylamide)</b> -pregelled starch graft copolymer is higher than that in case of carbamated pregelled starch irrespective of the metal ion used, (e) The adsorption values is higher at 30 �C then decreases by raising the temperature to 50 and 70 �C and (f) The adsorption values increase by increasing the treatment time up to 5 h then levels off...|$|E
