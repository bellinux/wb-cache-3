In a narration, the Didact proclaims the Forerunner's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear the <b>Mantle</b> <b>of</b> Responsibility, and humanity as the greatest threat in the galaxy. Master Chief removes his armor aboard Infinity; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty, the Chief's eyes are briefly shown.|$|E
5|$|Like all of Uranus' moons, Ariel {{probably}} {{formed from}} an accretion disc {{that surrounded the}} planet shortly after its formation, and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> ice. Ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps, canyons, and ridges. The surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons, most likely due to tidal heating.|$|E

40|$|The abundances of V, Cr, and Mn {{inferred}} for the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> {{the earth}} and moon decrease in that order and are similar in both mantles (but distinct {{from those in the}} <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the Eucrite Parent Body and Shergottite Parent Body), suggesting a common origin for the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> {{the earth and}} the moon. This hypothesis was investigated {{on the basis of a}} comparison between the depletions of V, Cr, and Mn in the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the earth and the moon, and the metal/silicate partition coefficients of these elements at 1260 C and 1 bar pressure among a S-bearing metallic liquid, a silicate melt, and a FeNi alloy. It was found that the earth and the moon depletions of V, Cr, and Mn are not correlated with metal/silicate partition coefficients; the V and Cr partitioned into S-rich metallic liquids under reducing conditions more strongly than Mn, consistent with the relative volatilities of these elements. This indicates that the depletion patterns of these elements in the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the earth and moon cannot be attributed primarily to terrestrial core formation...|$|R

Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|In early 902, Emir Ibrahim II {{was forced}} into abdication by his subjects, through the {{intervention}} of the Abbasid caliph. Ibrahim exchanged places with Abu'l-Abbas, who was named as his successor: Abu'l-Abbas left Sicily for Ifriqiya, while Ibrahim now resolved to take up the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> the Holy War, and accompanied a group of volunteers to Sicily in the summer. In an act that broke the long-standing stalemate on the island, Ibrahim and his followers advanced on Taormina, defeated the Byzantine garrison before its walls and laid siege to it. Left unsupported by the imperial government, the town fell on 1 August 902. Ibrahim then capitalized on his success by sending raiding parties against various strongholds in the vicinity, forcing either their capitulation and destruction or the payment of tribute.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E
5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|R

40|$|The {{indirect}} peroxidase {{method was}} employed to study the endocrine pancreas of the Cape fur seal. Immunoreactivity to insulin was confined to the cores of the islets and the insulin cells were more abundant than the other endocrine cell types, which occurred mainly in the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the islets. Of these, glucagon cells were the most numerous, followed by somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. The latter were observed in the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the islets and scattered in the exocrine tissue of the duodenal lobe. The marked variation in the shape {{and the distribution of}} the endocrine cells in the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> the islets seen in the pancreas of the seal, seems to be typical of carnivorous species like the cat and dog.

5|$|On 12 December 1575, {{after an}} interregnum of roughly {{one and a}} half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, {{representing}} a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski and others opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king, a Polish king. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected King of Poland and marry Stephen Báthory. In January 1576 Báthory passed the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> Voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland. On 1 May 1576 Báthory married Anna and was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. After being chosen as king in the Polish–Lithuanian royal election, 1576, Báthory also began using the title of the Prince of Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{giving of}} the first kvitel cements {{the status of a}} newly {{appointed}} Hasidic Rebbe. In Belz tradition, the first kvitel to a new Rebbe is proffered by a follower of the Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. Thus, when Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach assumed the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> leadership in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, he was given his first kvitel by Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk, a follower of the Ropshitz dynasty. Thirty-three years later, following the funeral of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, Rokeach's son and successor, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, received his first kvitelach from Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk and two other followers of the Ropshitz dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E

5|$|Thomas's fleet {{arrived at}} the capital first. Facing no {{opposition}} from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the mouths of the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army. Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of his huge force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had his young son Theophilos lead a procession along the walls, carrying {{a piece of the}} True Cross and the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae, in full view of both armies.|$|E
5|$|With Adair constitutionally ineligible to seek {{a second}} {{consecutive}} term, Desha was the first candidate to publicly declare his intention to seek the governorship in 1824. He began his campaign in late 1823 and faced little opposition until Christopher Tompkins declared his candidacy in May 1824. Tompkins was a little-known judge from Bourbon County who vehemently held {{to the principles of}} the Anti-Relief faction. Colonel William Russell, a military veteran of 50 years, also sought to carry the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> the Anti-Relief faction. While not as eloquent or well-versed in the faction's rhetoric, he had few political enemies and his military career brought him great respect among the electorate.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{one-shot}}, {{the events}} of The Killing Joke were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in the Birds of Prey series, {{she was in a}} wheelchair and became the computer hacker Oracle (this series was later adapted into a TV series of the same title). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, , involving the Joker murdering Robin (Jason Todd), The Killing Joke, leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later, Stephanie Brown. Gordon's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three yearsin DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, The New 52, which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV {{takes place}} in a high fantasy setting. The main {{location}} is Eorzea, a continent on the larger planet Hydaelyn: this contrasts Final Fantasy XI which uses one name to refer to the entire world and its regions. Eorzea is broken up among three main powers: the forest nation of Gridania; the desert-based Ul'dah sultanate; and the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa, Eorzea's dominant maritime power. Other important locations include the scholarly city-state of Sharlayan and the Garlean Empire, a hostile northern power with highly developed technology. Five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire invaded the land of Ala Migho, but were prevented from conquering Eorzea by the attacks of the ancient dragon Midgardsomr and his dragon hordes. In response to the Empire's threat, the three nations of Eorzea reform the Grand Companies, comprehensive centers of command which combine the cities' military and economic assets.

5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the <b>Mantle</b> <b>of</b> Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the <b>mantle</b> <b>of</b> the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

40|$|It {{is noted}} that {{it is helpful to}} divide the {{atmosphere}} of an early-type star into two parts: a photosphere and a mantle.

When modeling the mantle, one must take account of the deposition of nonradiative heat and momentum and one should recognize that the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> hot stars {{do not appear to be}} uniform or spherically symmetric. Five areas of discrepancy between classical theory and observation are noted and a possible way <b>of</b> modeling the <b>mantles</b> <b>of</b> early-type stars is outlined. The model consists of arcades of magnetic loops which form helmet-type structures in the equatorial band of the star, and of coronal-hole-type structures emmanating from weak unipolar regions which are chiefly distributed at polar latitudes...|$|R
