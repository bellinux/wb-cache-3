5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E

5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's {{career is}} in jeopardy, after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} and then chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> House's dismissal.

In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his money is not worth his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E
