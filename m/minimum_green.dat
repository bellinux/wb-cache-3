30|$|The above {{discussion}} {{makes clear}} that there is no unique and straightforward way towards a TUC-coordinated actuated control scheme, hence several alternative configurations, each carrying both benefits and shortcomings, which need to be carefully studied. As a basis for alternative configurations, the hybrid-TUC version is used. The green times decided by TUC are used as maximum green times for the actuated stages, while for <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times, the <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times also considered in TUC can be used. Note that stage skipping is not considered here, although it is an option worth to investigate in the future.|$|E

40|$|High {{intensity}} Activated cross WalK (HAWK), as {{an innovative}} pedestrian-activated beacon, {{has become a}} hot topic and was introduced in 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). According to the 2009 MUTCD?HAWK should be installed at least 100 feet from a stop-controlled intersection. This thesis first evaluates the distance between HAWK and stop-controlled intersection recommended by 2009 MUTCD. On {{the basis of the}} knowledge of HAWK operation, this thesis applies the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to model the pedestrian delay at an HAWK location. The HAWK pedestrian delay model includes the major street arrival rate, minor street arrival rate, pedestrian arrival rate and the distance between HAWK and intersection. Four different functional forms are investigated in order to select an appropriate one that could more accurately model pedestrian delay. The <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> time for vehicles, as an important variable in the HAWK pedestrian delay model and a peculiar element in HAWK operations, is also evaluated with VISSIM simulation based on different vehicle and pedestrian volume combinations. The impact of the HAWK on pedestrian delay is simulated by comparing pedestrian delay in scenarios with and without HAWK. The results indicate that the minimum distance between HAWK and stop-controlled intersection recommended in MUTCD may be inadequate for high demand situations. More distance from HAWK to stop-controlled intersection needs to be considered in order to avoid vehicle spillback to the upstream intersection. Based upon the results of training and validating datasets, it can be indicated that the HAWK pedestrian delay model developed in this study is capable of effectively evaluating the pedestrian delay with a satisfactory accuracy. The study also identifies that a <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> time for vehicles should be considered {{in order to reduce the}} vehicular delay and different <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times be provide for vehicles based on different pedestrian volume and vehicle volume combinations. A model of <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> time for vehicles is then derived from HAWK pedestrian delay model. Finally, the study results indicate that a HAWK installation may increase pedestrian delay for the stop-controlled intersection scenario when vehicle demand is low...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design a {{real-time}} robust arterial signal control system that gives priority to buses while simultaneously maximizing progression bandwidths and optimizing signal timing plans at each intersection along the arterial. The system architecture is divided into three levels. At the progression control level bandwidths are maximized. Existing progression strategies do not use real-time traffic data or use simple mathematical models to estimate traffic evolution. The proposed model eliminates this drawback by using real-time data to develop a neural network model for predicting traffic flows. Rather than using pre-specified values, queue clearance and <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times are computed as functions of the predicted queues. To eliminate uncertainty in the prediction due to the long time horizon, robust discrete optimization technique is used to determine the progression bands. At the intersection control level, signal timing plans are optimized subject to bandwidth constraints to allow for uninterrupted arterial flow, and <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> constraints for driver safety and to discharge average waiting queues. At the bus priority control level, whenever a bus is detected and is a candidat...|$|E

In the actuated control strategy, the <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> time is 10 [*]s, the maximum green time is 50 [*]s, and the extension of green time is set to 4 [*]s.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposal of novel signal design problem at isolated intersections, which {{assumes that the}} effective green times assigned to each signal phase follow dynamic user optimal (DUO) principle. At the DUO state, the average delays of vehicles using the signal phases with positive additional green times (the assigned effective green times minus the <b>minimum</b> effective <b>green</b> times) are equal and maximum. The proposed signal design problem is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem. The point queue (PQ) model is applied to represent traffic dynamics and to generate the cumulative traffic flows, which is further used to estimate the average delay of each signal phase. The existence of {{the solution of the}} proposed VI problem is proved and a solution algorithm based on the method of successive averages (MSA) is developed to solve the proposed signal design problem.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} agricultural systems on soil {{organic carbon content}} and CO 2 emission are investigated in this work. In a long-term experiment a conventional system, characterized by traditional agricultural practices (as deep tillage and chemical input) was compared with an organic one, including <b>minimum</b> tillage, <b>green</b> manure and organic fertilizers. Both systems have a three-year crop rotation including pea – durum wheat – tomato; the organic system is implemented {{with the introduction of}} common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare bicolor) as cover crops. In the year 2006 (5 years after the experimentation beginning) was determined the soil C content and was measured the CO 2 emissions from soil. The first results showed a trend of CO 2 production higher in organic soils in comparison with conventional one. Among the two compared cropping systems the higher differences of CO 2 emission were observed in tomato soil respect to the durum wheat and pea soils, probably due to the vetch green manuring before the tomato transplanting. These results are in agreement with the total organic carbon content and water soluble carbon (WSC), which showed the highest values in organic soil. The first observations suggest a higher biological activity and CO 2 emission in organic soil than conventional one, likely due to a higher total carbon soil content...|$|R

More specifically, the maximum green time of the main TUC stage is increased by a value equal to the total unused green time of the previous cycle, while the maximum green times of the actuated stages are decreased by values equal to their respective unused green times; the updates are of course subject to any applicable <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> time constraints.|$|E
30|$|The latter {{detectors}} {{have been}} located at 30  m {{in order to}} create a gap time parameter of 2  s. After some experimentation with the Chania urban network, it was found out that, due to low demands, actuated stages serving secondary movements were running most times at or close to their <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times. As a consequence, gap times higher than 2  s for the respective secondary movements were letting no room at all for actuation, and were thus indifferent for their own traffic conditions and the traffic conditions of the whole network, as well.|$|E
30|$|In case of {{configuration}} B, {{the high}} traffic loads {{in combination with}} the fact that the main TUC stages are (even with increased <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times) actuated and at the same time do not benefit from any unused green times, create negative effects for the traffic conditions all over the network. That is, after all, why control configuration case B presents the worst performance from all other considered coordinated actuated control cases in all considered demand scenarios. Its performance is even worse than TUC in all but demand scenario 2, where actuation indicates some, though very small, improvement.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of 1.5  µg mL− 1 bulk ZnO in Hoagland solution decreased nitrogenase activity {{in all the}} legumes. The maximum reduction was recorded in moth bean (71.2  %), while the <b>minimum</b> was in <b>green</b> gram (22.9  %) roots. However, a similar concentration of nano-ZnO stimulated nitrogenase activity in all the legumes except moth bean.

The stimulatory effect of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles on pectate lyase up to 10.5  µg mL− 1 due to chaperon-like activity has also been reported by Dutta et al. [22]. Additionally, the elevation of native state activity of the enzyme {{may be responsible for}} the observed increase as reported for pectate lyase in the {{presence of}} hydroxyapatite nanoparticles [23]. Higher stability of keratinase exposed to iron oxide nanoparticles is also known [24]. As for the present investigation on nitrogenase, either one or all of these reasons may be responsible for the stimulatory response to ZnO nanoparticles application up to a certain concentration.|$|R

30|$|According to case A, at each junction, {{the main}} TUC stage is defined {{to be the}} coordinated stage; all other stages are actuated. Offset {{reference}} point is thus {{the end of the}} green time of the main TUC stage. This implies that the main TUC stage takes advantage of all spare green time due to gap outs of the preceding actuated stages. This also implies, however, that the main stage may start earlier than ordered by TUC, thus disturbing the TUC-specified offsets. To avoid potentially harmful and/or undesired early gap outs of stages that according to historical data carry heavy loads, values higher than those considered by TUC may be used as <b>minimum</b> <b>green</b> times (e.g. 80 % of maximum green times). Alternatively, a higher gap time could be considered for these stages.|$|E

50|$|The {{absorbance}} {{spectrum of}} pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow <b>minimum</b> in the <b>green</b> {{region of the}} spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low {{as it is for}} the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity. According to the Beer-Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, T, decreases exponentially with thickness t, T = e−at, where a is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let G = e−aGt be the green transmittance and R = e−aRt be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (G/R) = e(aR-aG)t. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness t increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red.|$|R

The State of California is once again the first to mandate green building through its state building code. CALGreen requires all new construction to follow a <b>minimum</b> set of <b>green</b> building measures and provides additional green building measures that are voluntary, unless a jurisdiction mandates them. This thesis is a cost/benefit analysis of constructing a proposed office building to meet the mandatory and/or voluntary CALGreen requirements at 10799 International Drive. The extra initial costs totaled 1. 088 percent, 5. 292 percent, and 22. 304 percent above the baseline building for the mandatory CALGreen, voluntary Tier 1, and voluntary Tier 2 buildings, respectively. The quantifiable private benefits originated from utility savings by creating lower operating expenses in the base year, higher property values, and additional rent. The private benefits from the utility savings totaled 21, 157 for the mandatory CALGreen building, 167, 670 for the CALGreen Tier 1 building, and 348, 584 for the CALGreen Tier 2 building.
