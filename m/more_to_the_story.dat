5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to add <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing {{the characters in the}} end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he wanted to talk to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E

50|$|This film is <b>more</b> true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> than is <b>the</b> first film, Cheaper by the Dozen (1950).

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Arkham Asylum and Arkham City {{composer}} Nick Arundel {{returned to}} score Arkham Knight, while his partner on those games, Ron Fish, {{was replaced by}} composer David Buckley. On his continued involvement in the series, Arundel said [...] "One {{of the good things}} about doing a sequel, is you get the opportunity to redo , to revisit things... We have a set of material that we want to keep consistent, like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [...] theme and tailor it <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> for this game. How can we get the Scarecrow element out of that one theme." [...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel. Singer and record producer Trent Reznor served as a music consultant on Arkham Knights [...] "Be the Batman" [...] trailer.|$|E
2500|$|By 1993, it was announced, in Variety {{among other}} sources, that Lucas {{would be making}} the prequels. He began penning <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> now {{indicating}} the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals; at first {{they were supposed to}} be a [...] "filling-in" [...] of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a [...] "Saga". In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay to the first prequel, initially titled Episode I: The Beginning. Following the release of that film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two, and began work on Episode II.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene, the Doctor reads from La Vita Nuova.

5|$|Among the deleted {{scenes are}} some that added <b>more</b> {{background}} information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> with commentary available by the editor and director.

2500|$|Another fresh {{incarnation}} of Superman {{was introduced in}} September 2011 {{in the wake of}} DC’s Flashpoint event and as part of The New 52 publishing relaunch, and was retired in 2016 following the restoration of the post-Crisis Superman. The New 52 Superman's backstory is detailed in the first story arc of the second volume of Action Comics (2011–2012). This latest {{incarnation of}} Superman incorporates elements of nearly every previous version, and starts off as a reporter for the Daily Star (later changing to the Daily Planet). He and Lois are friends but not lovers, his parents are dead, and it is not until adulthood that he emerges as Superman. Later, after joining the Justice League, he starts a relationship with Wonder Woman. During the Truth storyline his secret identity is revealed to the world and he largely loses his powers after using a new power he calls a 'Solar Flare'. He struggles with vulnerability for the first time while fighting crime in an improvised way, while also dealing with not being taken as seriously, problems in his relationship with Wonder Woman that eventually cause him to end it, and regaining his powers. However, a combination of different trials prove fatal, Superman begins to slowly die, eventually turning to dust after saving lives one last time. After this Superman's death, the Post-Crisis Superman takes both his place as the current Superman, and his place in the current Justice League, and, with the DC Rebirth initiative (the publisher's attempt to set right unpopular character changes) this Superman is told that there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of his replacing New 52 Superman than he realises. At the conclusion of the [...] "Superman Reborn" [...] storyline, the histories of the pre-Flashpoint and New 52 Superman and Lois Lane are merged, effectively writing over the New 52 era as if it never happened and creating another soft reboot for characters in the Superman franchise.|$|E

He meets his end at the hands of Nagumo, who tears out his organs.

25|$|In 1994, {{an audio}} drama was {{released}} on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring Leonard Nimoy as the Time Traveller (named John in this adaptation) and John de Lancie as David Filby.

50|$|A false ending has two contexts; in literature, {{film and}} video games it is a {{narrative}} device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> In a musical composition, it is a complete stop of the song for one or more seconds before continuing.|$|E

A comprehensive study of long-run land use changes in eight tropical oil-producing countries shows that oil wealth tends to favour higher forest-cover conservation, as oil's powerful macroeconomic effects curtail both logging and agricultural expansion.
