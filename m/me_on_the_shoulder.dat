500|$|Broderick {{said of the}} Ferris Bueller role, [...] "It eclipsed everything, I should admit, and to {{some degree}} it still does." [...] Later at the 2010 Oscar tribute to Hughes, he said, [...] "For the past 25 years, nearly every day someone comes up to me, taps <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and says, 'Hey, Ferris, is this your day off?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Voges {{learned of}} the news during a tour match between his side, the Cricket Australia XI, and the ECB Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill. Of his {{learning}} of the selection, Voges said: [...] "Tony Dodemaide tapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and he said: 'Come with me. You're being substituted'. I thought I was in trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaime Murray {{completed}} the lead actors, playing Stacie Monroe who, as the grifters' only female member, is self-styled as [...] "the lure". Murray, described {{by one of}} the Hustle production team as [...] "that rare specimen â€“ a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act", and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5ft7in height with Stacie's description as having [...] "legs that go on for miles", was reportedly [...] "terrified" [...] to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying [...] "when we were filming the first couple of episodes I was absolutely petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn't see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God! I'm working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and ask me to get my coat!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{you should}} have heard him just whoop, and cackle, and carry on! He reached up and hit <b>me</b> one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Mell {{still looked}} at him, and still patted <b>me</b> kindly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{and said to}} himself, in a whisper, if I heard right: 'Yes, I thought so.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} me, and Mr. Mell's hand gently patted me upon <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I looked {{up with a}} flush upon my face and remorse in my heart, but Mr. Mell's {{eyes were fixed on}} Steerforth. He {{continued}} to pat <b>me</b> kindly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but he looked at him.|$|R
60|$|My {{guardian}} patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and seemed}} much amused.|$|E

6000|$|Concluding the Marriage Service of the Church of England {{in those}} {{well-known}} words, my uncle Starkweather shut up his book, {{and looked at}} me across the altar rails with a hearty expression of interest on his broad, red face. At the same time my aunt, Mrs. Starkweather, standing by my side, tapped <b>me</b> smartly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I take my {{leave of}} you, Mr. Creakle, {{and all of}} you,' said Mr. Mell, glancing round the room, and again patting <b>me</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> 'James Steerforth, <b>the</b> best wish I can leave you is that you may come {{to be ashamed of}} what you have done today. At present I would prefer to see you {{anything}} rather than a friend, to me, or to anyone in whom I feel an interest.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was over! Great Heaven! it was over, and {{we began}} to count our losses. Four of the Zulus were dead and two others were badly wounded--no, three, {{including}} Mavovo. They brought him to <b>me</b> leaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of Babemba and another Mazitu captain. He was a shocking sight, for {{he was shot in}} three places, and badly cut and battered as well. He looked at me a little while, breathing heavily, then spoke.|$|R
60|$|He {{stretched}} {{out a hand}} to pat <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> then thought better of it and drew it back.|$|E
60|$|Breaking from Parsons and Booth, I ran to meet him. He shook both {{my hands}} and then clapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Major drew a {{long breath}} of relief, and patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in high {{approval}} of what I had said to him.|$|E
60|$|I {{gave him}} my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my mother: she kissed me, patted <b>me</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and sat down again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I knew quite well {{that he was looking}} at us both; and I turned to the window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were {{drooping}} their heads in the cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, youngster!" [...] cried Jack Martin, giving <b>me</b> a slap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>the</b> day I {{joined the}} ship, [...] "come below and I'll show you your berth. You and I {{are to be}} messmates; and I think we shall be good friends, for I like the look o' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{friendly}} bout {{at point}} and edge, Robin and Randal Rutherford, being off duty, must needs carry {{me to the}} Tennis Court, where Tremouille and the King were playing two young lords, and that for such a stake as would have helped to arm a hundred men for the aid of Orleans. It was pretty to see the ball fly about basted from the walls, and the players bounding and striking; and, little as I understood the game, so eager was I over the sport, that a gentleman within the [...] "dedans" [...] touched <b>me</b> twice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> before I was aware of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "This I know," [...] {{says her}} father, {{slapping}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "this I know, {{that you are}} content to see Richard without primping." ...|$|E
60|$|I got up {{and took}} my hat. She patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I could have {{throttled}} her at that moment. And yet she was right.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you know}} {{anything}} more,' said I, standing composedly before her--she had patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{and sat down in}} my chair--'of that attachment of Agnes?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} I {{believed}} the fancy was mutual, {{and that there}} was nothing my wife liked better than telling people about stores. I added, in generalisation, that when a woman had spent all her own money on dress, it did her quite as much good to see other women spending theirs; and Deering said he guessed that was about so. He gave <b>me</b> a push <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> to make <b>me</b> understand how keenly he appreciated the joke, and I perceived that we had won his heart too.|$|R
60|$|At length, our {{course was}} crossed by a deep dell or dingle, {{such as they}} call {{in some parts of}} Scotland a den, and in others a cleuch or narrow glen. It seemed, by the broken glances which the moon {{continued}} to throw upon it, to be steep, precipitous, and full of trees, which are, generally speaking, rather scarce upon these shores. The descent by which we plunged into this dell was both steep and rugged, with two or three abrupt turnings; but neither danger nor darkness impeded the motion of the black horse, who seemed rather to slide upon his haunches, than to gallop down the pass, throwing <b>me</b> again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of <b>the</b> athletic rider, who, sustaining no inconvenience by the circumstance, continued to press the horse forward with his heel, steadily supporting him at the same time by raising his bridle-hand, until we stood in safety {{at the bottom of the}} steep--not a little to my consolation, as, friend Alan, thou mayst easily conceive.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life, Hunter {{underwent}} various forms of treatment including several alternative medicine remedies - he attended a traditional Korean medicine clinic to undertake [...] "an ancient metaphysical healing process, Qi". Hunter reflected, [...] "I have thought a lot about the possibility of dying... Now, I believe it doesn't really matter when or where you die, but how you live your life. If somebody diagnoses you with cancer and tells you they are going to cut open your jaw and take out a tumor, you would panic unless you had something to sustain you. But my time with the Qi masters gave <b>me</b> a tap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and reminded <b>me</b> we are spiritual beings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{returned}} one of them, {{bending down}} and touching <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "this {{is a matter}} that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but you're arrested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That means you, Noel," [...] the {{sergeant}} said, patting <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "The colonel quite rightly believes {{that we can}} give him valuable information, an' is eager to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{had only}} started to meet Major Clarke's force when you first arrived," [...] I said despondently, whereat Simon Kenton clapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in a {{friendly}} fashion, as he cried: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had {{not gone}} far when we came across the track of a black bear. We both felt certain that the trail was not many hours old. We {{followed}} it for two miles, and found it went up to a slide of rocks; they had come down from a cliff some years before, for there were bushes growing among them. As a rule a black bear will always leave you alone if you leave him, and hasn't much fight in him at the best; so up we went, thinking we were sure of our bear-steak without much trouble in getting it. I was ahead, and had just climbed up on to a big rock, when, from a bush in front, the bear came out {{at me with a}} growl. I expect it had cubs somewhere, I had just time to take a shot from the hip and then he was <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> and gave <b>me</b> a blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> that ripped <b>the</b> flesh down to the elbow.|$|R
60|$|I first {{observed}} an alteration in {{his conduct}} while rubbing in <b>the</b> phosphorus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, {{he ran his}} nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited {{at the time to}} pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw myself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>shoulder,</b> and I fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, Lady, since here stands one whom God and you {{together}} {{have given}} me to guard. For his sake I would keep my life in me," [...] and she touched <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{flashed a}} look at me, then averted her face. For some moments she stood hesitating; then, coming closer, touched <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and said softly: [...] "Turn away, do not look at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold up, my brave fellow," [...] says Captain Carton, {{clapping}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> like a friend, {{and giving}} me a flask. [...] "Put your lips to that, and they'll be red again. Now, boys, give way!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{metaphor of}} [...] "standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of giants" [...] {{is often used}} to promote and {{validate}} the free software movement. In the book Free as in Freedom, Bob Young of Red Hat supports the free software movement by saying that it enables people to stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of giants. He also says that standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of giants is the opposite of reinventing the wheel.|$|R
