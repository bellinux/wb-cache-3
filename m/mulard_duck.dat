50|$|The {{incubation}} {{period of the}} hybrid eggs is between the mallard and muscovy, {{with an average of}} 32 days. About half of the eggs hatch into <b>mulard</b> <b>ducks.</b> <b>Mulards</b> tend to combine certain traits of the parent breeds. Due to their muscovy heritage, they produce leaner meat than Pekins; females tend to be raised for meat while males are used for foie gras. Like muscovy <b>ducks,</b> <b>mulards</b> have claws on their feet, but do not fly and perch; instead, they prefer to stay on water, as Pekins do.|$|R
50|$|Today in France, {{the leading}} foie gras {{producer}} and consumer, {{the use of}} hybrid ducks outnumbers the use of geese.

2500|$|Lesions {{can occur}} on the sternum of the birds due to {{necrosis}} of the skin. [...] This is observed more frequently in birds reared in cages {{rather than on the}} floor.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to determine the prevalence and infection pattern of duck circovirus (DuCV) in subclinical Pekin ducks on South Korean duck farms. A total of 147 samples collected from 92 duck farms in five provinces were examined from 2011 to 2012. The overall prevalence of DuCV PCR-positive pooled bursa of Fabricius and liver samples was 21. 8 % (32 / 147). The prevalence of DuCV PCR-positive samples increased significantly in 3 -week-old ducks compared with that in 1 -week-old ducks (P< 0. 05). DuCV in association with Riemerella and Salmonella infections (10. 9 %; 16 / 147) occurred {{at the same level}} as infection with DuCV alone (10. 9 %; 16 / 147). In comparison of the relationship between bacterial diseases (salmonellosis, Riemerella infection) and morbidity in farms with and without DuCV, morbidity was higher in circovirus-positive farms (50 %; 16 / 32) than in circovirus-negative farms (26. 1 %; 30 / 115). Our findings provide baseline information on the degree of DuCV infection and distribution and pattern of DuCV in ducks, and it is evident that DuCV can be associated with subclinical diseases and that subclinical infection could be economically important.

40|$|Specimens {{from the}} Harderian gland, the {{lacrimal}} gland and bursa of Fabricius in ducks with chlamy-diosis were processed by the classical histological methods and permanent preparations were ob-tained. On single and serial histological cross-sections from material fixed in non-aqueous fixator, histochemical tests for PAS reactivity, staining with alcian blue at pH 1. 0 and 2. 5 {{as well as}} staining with Mowrys alcian blue followed by PAS reaction were performed. The light microscopic observa-tion did not reveal considerable changes in the lacrimal gland. Structural and functional changes with various character and degree in the central lobular parts of the Harderian gland, the epithelium, the propria and thymus-like lobules of the bursa of Fabricius were observed.

About 95% of duck foie gras production from France comes from force fed Mulards and the remaining 5% from the Muscovy duck. After hatching, the Mulard ducklings are sexed. Males put on more weight than females, so the females are slaughtered, sometimes in an industrial macerator. Up to 40 million female ducks may be killed in this way. The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food, fertilisers and in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E
40|$|The 2006 {{epidemic}} due {{to highly}} pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H 5 N 1 in Hungary caused {{the most severe}} losses in waterfowl which were, according to the literature at the time, {{supposed to be the}} most resistant to this pathogen. The presence of pathological lesions and the amount of viral antigen were quantified by gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the organs of four waterfowl species [mute swans (n = 10), domestic geese (n = 6), mulard ducks (n = 6) and Pekin ducks (n = 5) ] collected during the epidemic. H 5 N 1 subtype HPAIV was isolated from all birds examined. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) was also applied on a subset of samples [domestic geese (n = 3), mulard (n = 4) and Pekin duck (n = 4) ] in order to compare its sensitivity with IHC. Viral antigen was detected by IHC in all cases. However, the overall presence of viral antigen in tissue samples was quite variable: virus antigen was present in 56 / 81 (69 %) swan, 22 / 38 (58 %) goose, 28 / 46 (61 %) <b>mulard</b> <b>duck</b> and 5 / 43 (12 %) Pekin duck tissue samples. HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 was detected by qRRT-PCR in all birds examined, in 19 / 19 (100 %) goose, 7 / 28 (25 %) <b>mulard</b> <b>duck</b> and 12 / 28 (43 %) Pekin duck tissue samples. As compared to qRRTPCR, the IHC was less sensitive in geese and Pekin ducks but more sensitive in mulard ducks. The IHC was consistently positive above 4. 31 log 10 copies/reaction but it gave very variable results below that level. Neurotropism of the isolated virus strains was demonstrated by finding the largest amount of viral antigen and the highest average RNA load in the brain in all four waterfowl species examined...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOcular opacity, {{associated}} with reluctance {{to move and}} inability to feed properly, was observed in approximately 1 % of all newly hatched females from several related flocks of <b>Mulard</b> <b>ducks.</b> A 5 -week follow-up study of ten 1 -day-old affected females was performed, and they were compared with 10 control animals. Clinical, ocular and ultrasonographic examinations, a complete necropsy of 2 animals per group with histological examination of the eye, were performed weekly. A bilateral immature cortical anterior cataract was diagnosed at ocular examination and confirmed by ultrasonography in affected ducks. Dyscoria was occasionally observed in affected animals. Severe cataract, with Morgagnian globules, severe anterior fibre liquefaction and disorganisation were observed by photonic microscopy. No retinal or choroidal lesions were observed. No progression of ultrasonographic and microscopic lesions could be detected during the five weeks of examination. The female predisposition for the ocular lesions suggests a congenital sex-linked recessive cataract...|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} of foie gras occurs on the pretext that migrating wildfowl seasonally eat such that their liver naturally enlarges. [...] However, the bird used predominantly in foie gras production is {{a hybrid of}} a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck. [...] It has been noted that the Muscovy duck is non-migratory, and both the Pekin and the mulard hybrid cannot fly. Domestic ducks (including the Pekin) are derived from the mallard duck, which is sometimes migratory and sometimes not. Therefore, although the domestic goose might well be adapted to store food before migration, it is less likely that the <b>Mulard</b> hybrid <b>duck</b> has the same potential.|$|R

Hence, ducks {{play an important role}} in the introduction and transmission of avian influenza (AI) in the Egyptian poultry population. Attempts to control outbreaks include the use of vaccines, which have varying levels of efficacy and failure. To date, the effects of vaccine efficacy has rarely been determined in ducks. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of a live recombinant vector vaccine based on a turkey Herpes Virus (HVT) expressing the H 5 gene from a clade 2. 2 H 5 N 1 HPAIV strain (A/Swan/ Hungary/ 499 / 2006) (rHVT-H 5) and a bivalent inactivated H 5 N 1 vaccine prepared from clade 2. 2. 1 and 2. 2. 1. 1 H 5 N 1 seeds in <b>Mulard</b> <b>ducks.</b> A 0. 3 ml/dose subcutaneous injection of rHVT-H 5 vaccine was administered to one-day-old ducklings (D 1) and another 0. 5 ml/ dose subcutaneous injection of the inactivated MEFLUVAC was administered at 7 days (D 7). Four separate challenge experiments were conducted at Days 21, 28, 35 and 42, in which all the vaccinated ducks were challenged with 106 EID 50 /duck of H 5 N 1 HPAI virus (A/ chicken/Egypt/ 128 s/ 2012 (H 5 N 1) (clade 2. 2. 1) via intranasal inoculation. Maternal-derived antibody regression and post-vaccination antibody immune responses were monitored weekly. Ducks vaccinated at 21, 28, 35 and 42 days with the rHVT-H 5 and MEFLUVAC vaccines were protected against mortality (80 %, 80 %, 90 % and 90 %) and (50 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90 %) respectively, against challenges with the H 5 N 1 HPAI virus. The amount of viral shedding and shedding rates were lower in the rHVT-H 5 vaccine groups than in the MEFLUVAC groups only in the first two challenge experiments. However, the non-vaccinated groups shed significantly more of the virus than the vaccinated groups. Both rHVT-H 5 and MEFLUVAC provide early protection, and rHVT-H 5 vaccine in particular provides protection against HPAI challenge. S 1 Table.
