40|$|The moult {{migration}} of Greylag Geese Anser anser from Scania, southernmost Sweden, was studied based on resightings of neck-banded individuals marked in the breeding areas. Most geese seen in moulting areas {{were recorded in}} the <b>marking</b> <b>area</b> {{both before and after}} moult. Lip to 1992, 72 % of all neck-banded Greylag Geese recorded front a moulting area were reported from Oostvaardeusplassen in the Netherlands, 600 km from the <b>marking</b> <b>area.</b> After 1992, there was a change in the moult migration and the majority of the reports of moulting Greylag Geese from Scania were from the Danish island of Saltholm a distance of 50 km away. Owing to the increase in the Greylag Goose population, the moulting sire at Oostvardersplassen probably reached its carrying capacity and the geese had to move their moult site. The moult {{migration of}} the study population is discussed in relation to the food availability of the two main moulting sites...|$|E
40|$|Articulating paper mark size {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} in the dental community to be descriptive of occlusal load. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine if any direct relationship exists between articulating paper <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> and applied occlusal load. A uniaxial testing machine repeatedly applied a compressive load, beginning at 25 N and incrementally continuing up to 450 N, to a pair of epoxy dental casts with articulating paper interposed. The resultant paper markings (n =  600) were photographed, and analyzed the <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> using a photographic image analysis and sketching program. A two-tailed Student’s t-test for unequal variances compared the measured size of the <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> between twelve different teeth (p <  0. 05). Graphical interpretation of the data indicated that the <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> increased non-linearly with increasing load. When the data was grouped to compare consistency of the <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> between teeth, a high variability of <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> was observed between different teeth at the same applied load. The Student’s t-test found significant differences in the size of the <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> approximately 80 % of the time. No direct relationship between paper <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> and applied load could be found, although the trend showed increasing <b>mark</b> <b>area</b> with elevating load. When selecting teeth to adjust, an operator should not assume the size of paper markings, accurately describing the markings’ occlusal contact force content...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{patterning}} is {{a promising}} technology for biomedical applications. In this research project, a novel laser based marking method for toric contact eye lenses has been proposed. Toric contact eye lenses {{are designed to}} address general blurring that occurs due to uneven cornea which is known as astigmatism. Toric lenses have two powers in them, created with curvatures at different angles of cone. For proper functioning of toric lenses their orientation with respect to eye is critical. So toric lenses are manufactured with some form of marking which helps in deciding the orientation with respect to eye. The proposed method {{is to use the}} principle of laser interferometry in marking the metal inserts which will subsequently be transferred to lens surface during injection molding. For the research project stainless steel was selected as the material from the commonly used materials for the lens inserts. The marking of stainless steel with respect to different laser parameters (e. g. peak pulse power, rep rate, polarization and marking time) was studied. Mathematical modeling has also been done to predict the effect of aspherical curvature of lens insert on marking parameters and to study the effect of laser interference on the marking quality and quantity of stainless steel. The proposed marking method will not only reduce the <b>marking</b> <b>area</b> on the toric lens but also increase the visibility of the marking. In addition, using the principle of interference in marking reduces the amount of laser energy required for marking which reduces the heat affected zone thereby increasing the life of high value added metal insert...|$|E

Material and MethodThe following OCRS were selected: Accufilm II, BK 20, BK 21, BK 22, BK 23, BK 28, and BK 31. The thickness was measured in three points of the OCRS with an electronic measuring device (TESA), and the mean was calculated. To produce the marks on the strips, composite resin specimens were adapted to a universal testing machine (Versat 2000) with 40 kgf load cell at a speed of 1. 0 mm/min. The mark images were photographed with a stereoscopic microscope (Stemi SV 11) and processed and analyzed by the 550 -Leica Qwin® analyzer.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} observe the {{attraction}} effects of the artificial reef models on Alepocephalus, the behavior and distribution of Alepocephalus in the experimental flume under the presence of five reef models with different shapes and structures were studied using experimental ethology method, and the attraction effects of different reef models were compared. The {{results indicate that the}} distribution of Alepocephalus is rather dispersed when no reef model is put into the <b>marked</b> <b>area</b> of the flume, and they prefer to stay in relatively dark area. In this case, the Alepocephalus distribution ratio of the reef <b>marked</b> <b>area</b> is 7 %. When reef models are put into the <b>marked</b> <b>area,</b> Alepocephalus shows obvious positive taxis to them. And the Alepocephalus distribution ratio of the reef <b>marked</b> <b>area</b> increased to a level between 16 % and 29 %. In addition, the apertured cubical reef model shows the best attraction effect with a distribution ratio of 29 %...|$|R

LDH usually be synthesized into powder, and is utilized to be a drug delivery. This work presents a method for directly forming Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH on the pure Mg substrate and the coating of the Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH could increase the ability of corrosion-resistant in C-SBF at 37. 5 。C. Moreover, {{the size of the}} platelet-like structure of Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH is affected by the pH value of the Fe 3 +/HCO 3 -/CO 32 - at 70 。C. the size of the platelet-like structure of Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH the CO 2 pH 6. 0 / 20 h sample is bigger than the CO 2 pH 4. 6 / 20 h sample. Repeatedly sliding on the CO 2 pH 4. 6 / 20 h sample could be an effective way to change the morphology of the CO 2 pH 4. 6 / 20 h sample. From the cross-sectional observation of the CO 2 pH 4. 6 / 20 h sample by TEM, Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH (the top layer), the middle layer and inner layer were observed. The thickness of Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH is around 1 um, the middle layer is around 2 ~ 2. 5 um and the inner layer is 1 ~ 2 um. The Mg-Fe-CO 3 LDH is composed of Mg, Fe, C and O. Moreover, the middle layer and the inner layer are composed of Mg, C and O.

We propose that this transform fault effect is due to along-axis variations in the final depth of melting in the subaxial mantle, reflecting the colder thermal regime of the ridge near the Kane transform. Calculations made with a passive mantle flow regime suggest that these along-axis variations in the final depth of melting would not produce {{the full range of}} crustal thickness variations observed in the <b>MARK</b> <b>area</b> seismic record.
