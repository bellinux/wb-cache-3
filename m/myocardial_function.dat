Sprague Dawley rats were orally administrated with probucol at different dosage or vehicle for 5 days {{and subjected to}} a CA model by electrical stimulation, followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid oxidation markers were measured in serum and myocardium. Hemodynamic parameters and <b>myocardial</b> <b>functions</b> of animals were analyzed. Expression of erythroid-derived 2 -like 2 (NFE 2 L 2) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP 1) in the myocardium were examined with immunohistochemistry. Results. Probucol treatment significantly increased the ROSC rate and survival time of CA-induced rats. After ROSC, levels of oxidation-specific markers were decreased, while activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased significantly in probucol treatment groups. The probucol treatment improves hemodynamic parameters and <b>myocardial</b> <b>functions.</b> These parameter changes were in a dose-dependent manner. In the probucol treatment groups, the expression of KEAP 1 was downregulated, while that of NFE 2 L 2 was upregulated significantly. Conclusion.

40|$|A time-domain {{filtering}} {{algorithm is}} proposed to recover <b>myocardial</b> kinematic <b>function</b> using output-only measurements without the time history of external loads. The main contribution of this work is that the overall effect of all the external loads on the myocardium is treated as a random variable disturbed by the Gaussian white noise because the external loads of the myocardium are usually unknown in practical exercises. The kernel of our proposed algorithm is an iterative, multiframe, and sequential filtering procedure consisting of a Kalman filter and a least-squares filter. In our proposed implementation, the initial guess of <b>myocardial</b> kinematic <b>function</b> and residual innovation of all the state variables are first computed using a Kalman filter via state space equations only driven by the Gaussian white noise, and then the residual innovation is fed into a least-squares filter to estimate the total external loads of the myocardium.

Moreover, the endothelium of the myocardial (heart muscle) capillaries, which is also closely appositioned to the cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), is involved in this modulatory role. Thus, the cardiac endothelium (both the endocardial endothelium and the endothelium of the myocardial capillaries) controls {{the development of the}} heart in the embryo {{as well as in the}} adult, for example during hypertrophy. Additionally, the contractility and electrophysiological environment of the cardiomyocyte are regulated by the cardiac endothelium.|$|E
5000|$|DATS can be metabolized by {{glutathione}} in {{red blood}} cells to form hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This conversion occurs at a consistent rate over a prolonged period of time, rendering DATS {{a good source of}} H2S. [...] H2S is a cardioprotective agent that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects,. A major topic of research is the impact of hydrogen sulfide on reducing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury is a significant threat to <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> that arises with the reintroduction of blood flow to the heart following an ischemic episode. Reperfusion triggers an inflammatory response and often results in oxidative damage. H2S decreases injury through many different effects such a decrease in oxidative stress, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and increased eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) activation. eNOS is activated via phosphorylation by H2S through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which increases the formation and bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). This negatively impacts mitochondria functionality. The mitochondria has been known to protect the heart from ischemic-reperfusion injury through the opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel,. This causes vasodilation and improves hemodynamics.|$|E

Less serious adverse effects may include abdominal pain, headache, blurry vision, throat and mouth irritation, vomiting, nausea, and coughing. A 2014 WHO report said, [...] "ENDS nicotine delivery system use poses serious threats to adolescents and fetuses." [...] Aside from toxicity exposure in normal use, there are also risks from misuse or accidents such as nicotine poisoning (especially among infants and children), contact with liquid nicotine, fires caused by vaporizer malfunction, and explosions resulting from extended charging, unsuitable chargers, or design flaws.

50|$|After {{qualifying}} {{in medicine}} in 1967, Poole-Wilson {{started his career}} with training posts in London hospitals. In 1973 he was awarded a British-American Research Fellowship, supported by the British Heart Foundation, and undertook research in the well-known heart lab at UCLA, California, then under the chairmanship of Glenn Langer. There he learnt to measure the movement of K, Na and Ca ions in the isolated, but arterially perfused, interventricular preparation which could be made truly ischaemic. He studied the effects of acidosis and ischaemia on <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> and Ca exchange and his early results suggested that developed force and Ca exchange were more responsive to acidosis within the cell than to extracellular acidosis. Something we are much more aware of today. Returning to the UK in 1976 he was appointed senior lecturer at the Cardiothoracic Institute (later to become the National Heart and Lung Institute NHLI) under Peter Harris for whom he had eternal regard. His honorary consultant physician status at the National Heart Hospital allowed him to investigate the mechanisms underlying K ion loss from hypoxic and ischaemic tissue both in the laboratory and in the clinic where {{he was one of}} the first to measure the K ion concentration and pH in the coronary vessels of humans using catheter-based ion sensitive electrodes.|$|E
40|$|Function of {{the heart}} begins long before its {{formation}} is complete. Analyses in mouse and zebrafish have shown that <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> is not required for early steps of organogenesis, such as formation {{of the heart}} tube or chamber specification. However, whether <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> is required for later steps of cardiac development, such as endocardial cushion (EC) formation, has not been established. Recent technical advances and approaches have provided novel inroads toward the study of organogenesis, allowing us {{to examine the effects}} of both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> on EC formation in zebrafish. To address whether <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> is required for EC formation, we examined s ilent heart (sih -/-) embryos, which lack a heartbeat due to mutation of cardiac troponin T (tnnt 2), and observed that atrioventricular (AV) ECs do not form. Likewise, we determined that cushion formation is blocked in cardiofunk (cfk -/-) embryos, which exhibit cardiac dilation and no early blood flow. In order to further analyze the heart defects in cfk -/- embryos, we positionally cloned cfk and show that it encodes a novel sarcomeric actin expressed in the embryonic myocardium. The Cfk s 11 variant exhibits a change in a universally conserved residue (R 177 H). We show that in yeast this mutation negatively affects actin polymerization. Because the lack of cushion formation in sih- and cfk- mutant embryos could be due to reduced <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> and/or lack of blood flow, we approached this question pharmacologically and provide evidence that reduction in <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> is primarily responsible for the defect in cushion development. Our data demonstrate that early <b>myocardial</b> <b>function</b> is required for later steps of organogenesis and suggest that <b>myocardial</b> <b>function,</b> not endothelial shear stress, is the major epigenetic factor controlling late heart development.

40|$|Concept of {{deterioration}} of <b>myocardial</b> contractile <b>function</b> under long-term intake of antiarrhythmic drugs may {{be regarded as}} one of the myths of modern cardiology. Multiple references to negative influence of majority of antiarrhythmic drugs on <b>myocardial</b> inotropic <b>function</b> are speculative. Studies on estimation of influence of arrhythmia treatment strategy on <b>myocardial</b> contractile <b>function</b> are almost absent. Aim. To estimate dynamics of <b>myocardial</b> contractile <b>function</b> in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) compared among those treated with amiodarone 200 mg daily and with bisoprolol 5 mg daily. Material and methods. A total of 47 IHD patients with persistent AF were enrolled into the study. Sinus rhythm (SR) was restored during the first 24 hours of hospitalization in all the pa- tients. After SR restoration the patients were randomly allocated to two groups receiving either amiodarone 200 mg daily during 6 months for SR maintenance (group 1) or bisoprolol 5 mg daily for ventricular rate (VR) control (group 2). To estimate <b>myocardial</b> inotropic <b>function</b> all patients underwent steady-state radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) and echocardiography during the first 24 hours after SR restoration and 6 months later. Results. We revealed changes in left ventricle (LV) diastolic function, reduction of left atrium (LA) contribution to LV diastole and enlargement of LA anterior-posterior dimension during the first 24 hours after SR restoration in the patients of both groups. 6 -month SR maintenance in the first group of patients promoted significant decrease in isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) from 103. 4 ± 1. 01 ms to 96. 4 ± 1. 1 ms (р= 0. 02) and reduction of LA anterior-posterior dimension up to 36. 1 ± 3. 8 mm (р= 0. 03). Target VR achievement in the second group of patients promoted restoration of LV diastolic function (decrease in IVRT from 104. 3 ± 1. 2 ms to 97. 3 ± 1. 2 ms; р= 0. 03) but did not influence LA size (44. 1 ± 3. 1 mm and 43. 5 ± 3. 0 mm, respectively). Atrial inotropic function was only changed in the patients of group 1, the patients of group 2 did not reveal significant change in LA contribution to LV diastole. Conclusion. 6 -month SR maintenance at amiodarone intake in IHD patients with persistent AF resulted in LA contraction, restoration of its contractility and improvement of LV diastolic parameters. Target VR for 6 months of bisoprolol intake led to LV diastolic function improvement, but did not influence LA dimension and contractile function. </p...|$|R
