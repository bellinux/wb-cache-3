5|$|The {{first time}} the Christmas hymns of the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of Bach's Magnificat were printed {{was in the same}} volume as the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat, in the 1862 Bach Gesellschaft XI/1 publication, which {{presented}} the hymns in an annex. In that publication the hymns were however not transposed to fit in the D major setting of the Magnificat. More recently publishers offer such transposed (and completed) versions of the hymns, {{so that they can be}} performed as part of the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat, for instance Novello in 2000 (Neil Jenkins) and Bärenreiter in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{score of}} the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of Bach's Magnificat was first {{published}} by Simrock in 1811, edited by Georg Pölchau, however without the Christmas hymns. These were published in 1862, in the appendix of Volume 11/1 of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe, a publication that contained the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat (and not the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version).</b>|$|E
5|$|A new {{critical}} {{edition of}} both BWV 243 and 243a {{was published in}} 1955 as Series 2, Volume 3 of the New Bach Edition. Although the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> remained the standard for life performance and studio recordings, {{half a century later}} also the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> had been published in new editions adapted to performance, it had been recorded several times, and its composition history had been further unravelled.|$|E

5|$|As natural {{trumpets}} {{were usually}} tuned in D in Saxony, this is given {{as a reason}} why Bach transposed the initial E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> to D major.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat. The E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|Novello {{published}} {{both the}} E-flat major and the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat {{in a single}} publication in 2000, edited by Neil Jenkins. This edition also offered a transposed version of the Christmas 1723 laudes {{so that they could}} be fitted in performances of the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat. The last measures of the Virga Jesse, missing from the autograph score, were in this edition completed on the base of a similar composition by Bach.|$|E

Philip Pickett's 1995 recording of the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> appeared on L'Oiseau Lyre. Other CD releases with BWV 243a that became available before {{the end of the}} century include a recording by Rilling and the Gächinger Kantorei, one with the Regensburger Domspatzen, and one with Rolf Schweizer, the Motettenchor Pforzheim and L'arpa festante playing on period instruments.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Maderna {{recorded}} BWV 243a, {{with the}} choir and orchestra of the Südwestdeutscher Rundfunk, and Hedy Graf, Hildegard Laurich, Adalbert Kraus and Michael Schopper as vocal soloists, in 1971. Its CD-release as volume 8 of the Maderna Edition by Arkadia was in 1991. The first recording on period instruments of Bach's Magnificat, {{with the four}} choral Christmas interpolations (BWV 243a), was released by Simon Preston and the Academy of Ancient Music in 1978 (L'Oiseau Lyre / Decca), coupled with Vivaldi's Gloria. Nicolaus Harnoncourt's first recording of the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> followed in 1984. Also Helmuth Rilling and John Eliot Gardiner had by then recorded the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat.|$|E

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Arnold Schering {{edited the}} full orchestral {{score of the}} D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of Bach's Magnificat for {{publication}} by Ernst Eulenburg and Edition Peters. Performances of the Magnificat by, among others, Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra were recorded in the 1940s and appeared on 78 rpm records. LP recordings of the early 1950s included live performances of the Magnificat directed by Otto Klemperer and by Herbert von Karajan, the last one with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as soprano.|$|E
5|$|The Neue Bach Ausgabe {{published}} Bach's Magnificat (both BWV 243a and BWV 243) in 1955, {{edited by}} Alfred Dürr. This Urtext score was reused in several ensuing publications by Bärenreiter, among which several with an English translation. More {{recordings of the}} Magnificat became available, for instance directed by Kurt Redel, Leonard Bernstein, Karl Richter and Karl Ristenpart. The {{second half of the}} 1960s saw the first recordings of the Christmas version of the Magnificat BWV 243a including the laudes, and new recordings of the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> by von Karajan, Karl Münchinger and Daniel Barenboim.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recording}} by Rilling, of the D <b>major</b> <b>version</b> with Christmas interpolations, with {{a performance}} time of 40:06, was reissued {{under the title}} Christmas Magnificats, and also issued in comparison to a recording of the Magnificat in D by Kurt Thomas under the title Compare.

5|$|The {{score of}} the E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version</b> of Bach's Magnificat was first {{published}} by Simrock in 1811, edited by Georg Pölchau, however with printing errors, and without the Christmas hymns. It was the first composition of Bach for vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra that was printed in orchestral score, {{but at the time}} this publication had little success in sales. When in 1822 young Felix Mendelssohn composed a Magnificat in D major he showed that he knew Bach's version.|$|E
5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat <b>major</b> <b>version,</b> BWV243a) it had the same expandable format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E
