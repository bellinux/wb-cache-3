50|$|Pulse oximetry was {{developed}} in 1972, by Takuo Aoyagi and Michio Kishi, bioengineers, at Nihon Kohden using the ratio of red to infrared light absorption of pulsating components at the <b>measuring</b> <b>site.</b> Susumu Nakajima, a surgeon, and his associates first tested the device in patients, reporting it in 1975. It was commercialized by Biox in 1981 and Nellcor in 1983. Biox was founded in 1979, and introduced the first pulse oximeter to commercial distribution in 1981. Biox initially focused on respiratory care, but when the company discovered that their pulse oximeters were being used in operating rooms/theaters to monitor oxygen levels, Biox expanded its marketing resources to focus on operating rooms in late 1982. A competitor, Nellcor (now part of Covidien, Ltd.), began to compete with Biox for the U.S. operating room market in 1983. Prior {{to the introduction of}} pulse oximetry, a patient's oxygenation could only be determined by arterial blood gas, a single-point measurement that takes several minutes for sample collection and processing by a laboratory. In the absence of oxygenation, damage to the brain starts within 5 minutes with brain death ensuing within another 10-15 minutes. The worldwide market for pulse oximetry is over a billion US dollars. With the introduction of pulse oximetry, a non-invasive, continuous measure of patient's oxygenation was possible, revolutionizing the practice of anesthesia and greatly improving patient safety. Prior to its introduction, studies in anesthesia journals estimated U.S. patient mortality as a consequence of undetected hypoxemia at 2,000 to 10,000 deaths per year, with no known estimate of patient morbidity.|$|E

The Intercomparison {{is a part of the}} Solid Precipitation Measurement Intercomparison organised by the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observations of the World Meteorological Organisation (CIMO/WMO). The Hellmann gauge (German type) is used as the standard precipitation gauge in Croatia.

An assessment of exiting simulators including hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) has shown {{that there is a}} need for a hardware simulator with a comprehensive description of WECS aerodynamics.;The report reviews the modelling of WECS and establishes models for both the aerodynamics and drive train dynamics. Once the models have been established the hardware and software used for the simulator are introduced. The hardware consists of a DC drive controlling a DC motor, which acts as a prime mover and provides a shaft torque for a grid connected induction generator. The software used to model the WECS 'front end' and to provide a torque demand, via a serial communications link for the DC drive, is the Matlab/Simulink environment with the Real-Time Workshop.;A model of a 45 kW WECS is developed from specifications provided, and implemented in Simulink as a software-only design. Verification of the model is obtained by comparing the performance of the simulation with <b>measured</b> <b>site</b> data.;Following the verification of the software-only model, the effects of including hardware in the simulation are modelled and assessed. Additionally, the effects of including the DC motor in the hardware test-bed are investigated and compensated for prior to the assessment of HILS.;The results of the HILS show that the simulator compares favourably with the <b>measured</b> <b>site</b> data and meets the objectives of the project brief. There are, however, some discrepancies between the simulated results and <b>measured</b> <b>site</b> data at high frequencies due to noise in the system.

40|$|The neutron {{moisture}} gauge {{is compared}} with the gravimetric-core soil sampling technique, tensiometers and resistance blocks in relation to stability, Held variability, spatial dependence and number of samples needed at a given level of significance. The variance of field water content measurements with neutron moisture gauges is {{lower than that of}} the gravimetric sampling, which therefore requires 2 to 6 times as many samples as the number of <b>measuring</b> <b>sites</b> of the gauges to attain the same level of significance. The space dependence of the measurements made with the subsurface gauge varied depending on the average field soil water content. No space dependence was evident when the water content was lower than 0. 2 cm³. cm- 3 (50 % saturation). Measurements with the tensiometers and resistance blocks manifested no spatial dependence and therefore randomly selected <b>measuring</b> <b>sites</b> can be adapted to Held research work where these methods are to be utilized. Soil water content measurements estimated with neutron moisture gauges showed well defined temporal stability (i. e., the lowest, average and the highest soil water content measurements occur at the same field site) which implies that soil water status of an entire field can be assessed with measurements limited to few locations. Measurements with both tensiometers and the resistance blocks are time variant (i. e., the site giving field average water content changes spatially in time) owing to their relatively smaller measuring domains (i. e., scale of the area which can be represented by a single measurement) as compared to neutron gauges. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} define the <b>measuring</b> <b>sites</b> of the tensiometers and resistance blocks as to assess soil water status of the entire field, as it could be done with the neutron gauge...|$|R

A {{measuring}} {{campaign was}} performed over the neighboring towns of Nova Gorica in Slovenia and Gorizia in Italy on 24 and 25 May 2010, {{to investigate the}} con-centration and distribution of urban aerosols. Tracking of two-dimensional spatial and temporal aerosol distributions was performed using scanning elastic LIDAR, operating at 1064 nm. In addition, PM 10 concentrations of particles, NOx concentrations and meteorological data were continuously monitored within the LIDAR scanning region. Based on the data we collected, we investigated the flow dynamics and the aerosol concentrations within the lower troposphere and found an evidence for daily aerosol cycles. We observed {{a number of cases}} with spatially localized increased LIDAR returns, which are associated with the presence of point sources of particulate matter. Daily aerosol concentration cy-cles were also clearly visible with a peak in aerosol con-centration during the morning rush hours and daily plateau at around 17 : 00 Central European Time. We also found that horizontal atmospheric extinction at the height of 200 m, av-eraged in limited region with a radius of 300 m directly above the ground-based <b>measuring</b> <b>site,</b> was linearly correlated to the PM 10 concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0. 84.

Methods: A new analysis method, which we named the gingival melanosis record (GMR), is a quantitative analysis method using clinical oral photographs. We obtained 659 clinical photographs from 263 patients from 16 general dental offices in Japan. Standardized <b>measuring</b> <b>sites</b> were automatically spotted on the screen, and the presence of gingival melanosis was determined at the <b>measuring</b> <b>sites.</b> We assessed the validity of the GMR with the previously reported Hedin’s classification using Spearman’s rank correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients.
