6000|$|... "Wonderful?" [...] {{echoed the}} Captain, puffing his pipe vigorously, {{as was his}} wont when a little puzzled for an {{expression}} or an idea. [...] "No, he ain't wonderful; that's not the word. He's a life-preserver, that's wot he is. None o' your hinflated injinrubber or cork affairs, but a reg'lar, hanimated, walkin', self-actin' life-preserver. Why, I've know'd him, off and on, since he was {{the length of a}} <b>marline</b> <b>spike,</b> d'ye see--an' I've seed him save dozens, ay dozens, of lives--men, women, and children,--in lifeboats, an' in luggers, an' swimmin'. Why, he thinks no more o' that wot he's done to-night, than he does of eatin' salt junk. He's got a silver medal from the Royal Life-Boat Institution, an' another from the Queen of Spain, and a gold 'un from some other king or queen, I don't 'xactly know who--besides no end o' thanks, written on paper, also on wot they calls wellum, in beautiful German text and small-hand;--ho! you know, nobody knows wot that feller's been a-doin' of all his life. If he was hung round with all the gold and silver medals he deserves to have, he'd go to the bottom--life-preserver though he is--like the sheet-anchor of a seventy-four, he would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The amazement of our {{visitors}} is very great. Myouk, {{his wife}} and baby, and his son Meetek, are now our guests. When they first came in sight of the brig they uttered a wild shout--the men did so, at least--and tossed their arms and opened their eyes and mouths. They have never shut them since. They go all round the vessel, staring and gaping with amazement. We have given them a number of useful presents, and intend to send them home loaded with gifts for their friends. It is necessary {{to make a good}} impression on them. Our lives depend very much on the friendship of these poor people. We find that they are terrible thieves. A number of knives and a hatchet were missed--they were found hidden in Myouk's sledge. We tried to prevail on Oomia to sell her long boots. To our surprise she was quite willing to part with one, but nothing would induce her to give up the other. One of the men observed her steal a knife out of the cabin and hide it in the leg of her boot. The reason was now plain. We pulled off the boot without asking leave, and found there a large assortment of articles stolen from us. Two or three knives, a spoon, a bit of hoop-iron, and a <b>marline</b> <b>spike.</b> I have tried to make them understand, by signs, that this is very wicked conduct, but they only laugh at me. They are not in the least ashamed, and evidently regard stealing as no sin.|$|E
50|$|The shark symbolised a U-boat and the <b>marline</b> <b>spike</b> {{the tool}} of the Merchant navy. The net and the mines were both symbols of the {{fishermen}} who now found themselves at war seeking a new deadly catch. Never before had {{one section of the}} Royal Navy been similarly honoured.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the badge {{measured}} {{roughly the size of}} an old shilling. The design had to symbolise the work of both the minesweeping and the anti-submarine personnel. The finished design took the form of a shield upon which a sinking shark, speared by a <b>marline</b> <b>spike,</b> was set against a background made up of a fishing net with two trapped enemy mines. This was flanked by two examples of the nautical knot and at the top the naval crown. Beneath the badge was a scroll bearing the letters M/S-A/S (Minesweeping Anti-Submarine).|$|E
5000|$|The 1951 children's novel Punchbowl Midnight by Monica Edwards {{features}} {{the story of}} the Unknown Sailor and the Sailor's Stone. One of the characters, Tamzin Grey, believes that she has been cursed because she scratched her initials on the stone with a penknife. [...] "It was for his money they did it, of course," [...] Lindsey said. [...] "And there's a curse, you know.""What sort of curse?""Someone put a stone where the crime was committed and it says on it, 'Cursed be the man who injureth or moveth this stone.'"..."Lindsey, are you sure it says 'injureth' as well as 'moveth'?""Of course. Why?""Well, it's a pretty slender outlook for me, then. I found the stone two days ago and I scratched my initials on it with the <b>marline</b> <b>spike</b> of my knife. Funny thing, I didn't notice any curse at all.""It's {{on the back of the}} stone," [...] said Lindsey.|$|E
