40|$|We {{investigate}} deep generative {{models that}} can exchange multiple <b>modalities</b> bi-directionally, e. g., generating images from corresponding texts and vice versa. Recently, some studies handle multiple <b>modalities</b> on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that <b>modalities</b> {{are forced to}} have a conditioned relation, i. e., we can only generate <b>modalities</b> in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all <b>modalities</b> and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all <b>modalities</b> are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of <b>modalities.</b> Furthermore, {{to be able to}} generate missing <b>modalities</b> from the remaining <b>modalities</b> properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective <b>modalities.</b> Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple <b>modalities</b> and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple <b>modalities</b> bi-directionally...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is aimed}} to {{determine}} the learning styles-oriented perceptual preferences (<b>modalities)</b> of the sixth grade students studying in primary schools in the central district of Edirne and the learning and teaching styles-oriented perceptual preferences (<b>modalities)</b> of their English teachers. This study was done in frame of survey research model. The subjects {{of this study were}} 642 sixth grade students and their 20 English teachers who were working at fifteen different primary schools in the central district of Edirne in 2010 - 2011 academic year. In order {{to determine the}} learning <b>modalities</b> of the students and the teachers, Grasha-Riechmann Learning Styles Inventory; and for the teaching <b>modalities</b> of the teachers Grasha Teaching Styles Inventory was used. Both scales were adapted to Turkish by the researcher. The obtained data were analyzed in the SPSS package program. To analyze the data collected, frequency, percentage, mean values were calculated and the independent t- test, one-way ANOVA and correlation tests were used. The findings of the study indicated that i) the students’ collaborative and participant learning <b>modalities</b> are more dominant than the other learning <b>modalities,</b> ii) gender is an important factor for avoidant, collaborative, dependent and participant learning <b>modalities,</b> iii) socio-economic status is not an important factor affecting the learning <b>modalities,</b> iv) students’ report card marks are determining factor for just the avoidant, dependent and participant learning <b>modalities.</b> When the learning <b>modalities</b> of the teachers were investigated, it was revealed that teachers’ participant and dependent learning <b>modalities</b> are more dominant than the learning <b>modalities</b> of collaborative, competitive, independent and avoidant. In terms of the teaching <b>modalities</b> of the teachers, it is identified that the teachers got the highest percentage point from the personal model sub-scale. Also, the findings showed that the sex variable {{is an important factor in}} favor of the females for the expert and personal model teaching <b>modalities.</b> The variable of seniority had no significant effect on the differentiation of teaching <b>modalities</b> of the teachers.

40|$|Introduction: Physical <b>modalities</b> are {{performed}} by physiotherapists based on physiatrists’ orders, so the residents pay {{less attention to}} the need and importance of learning the practical <b>modalities.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of teaching the practical aspects of <b>modalities</b> to residents of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in order to improve their skills and attitudes toward ordering and doing physical <b>modalities.</b> Methods: In an interventional, before after study, all residents of physical medicine and rehabilitation, took the medical history of the patients willingly participatedand performed physical examinationand ordered physical <b>modalities.</b> They were also assessed by performing the <b>modalities</b> on the patient. Following the primary assessment, an experienced physiotherapist taught the residents how to do physical <b>modalities.</b> After the practical education, residents were assessed by ordering the <b>modalities</b> and performing them on simulated patients. Their satisfaction of the educational program was evaluated after the intervention. Results: The mean scores of using <b>modalities</b> before and after the education were 23. 08 ± 5. 50 and 52 ± 10. 18 respectively (p= 0. 0001). The mean scores of ordering the <b>modalities</b> before and after the education were 1 and 1. 66 (p= 0. 038). The mean score of satisfaction was 91. 66 ± 8. 74 out of 100. Conclusion: Since physical medicine and rehabilitation residents and specialists who order physical <b>modalities</b> for patients do not perform it on their own patients, teaching the practical physical <b>modalities</b> can improve their skills.

40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} in modelling quantum systems using coalgebraic techniques, we introduce a fibred coalgebraic logic. Our approach extends the conventional predicate lifting semantics with additional <b>modalities</b> relating conditions on different fibres. As this fibred setting will typically involve multiple signature functors, the logic incorporates a calculus of <b>modalities</b> enabling {{the construction of}} new <b>modalities</b> using various composition operations. We extend the semantics of coalgebraic logic to this setting, and prove that this extension respects behavioural equivalence. We show how properties of the semantics of <b>modalities</b> are preserved under composition operations, and then apply the calculational aspect of our logic to produce an expressive set of <b>modalities</b> for reasoning about quantum systems, building these <b>modalities</b> up from simpler components. We then demonstrate how these <b>modalities</b> can describe some standard quantum protocols. The novel features of our logic are shown to allow for a uniform description of unitary evolution, and support local reasoning such as "Alice's qubit satisfies condition" as is common when discussing quantum protocols.

25|$|Considering evidentiality {{as a type}} of epistemic <b>modality</b> {{may only}} be the result of {{analyzing}} non-European languages in terms of the systems of <b>modality</b> found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic <b>modality</b> (and are thus ambiguous when taken out of context). Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001) finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).|$|E
