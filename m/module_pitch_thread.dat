50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b> Superfine <b>pitch</b> metric <b>threads</b> are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>pitch</b> gauges {{are used}} as a {{reference}} tool in determining the <b>pitch</b> of a <b>thread</b> that is on a screw or in a tapped hole.

This device also saves time, in that it removes the need for the user to measure and calculate the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> of the <b>threaded</b> item.|$|R
50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity.

50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger <b>pitch</b> (fewer <b>threads</b> per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller <b>pitch</b> (more <b>threads</b> per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
5000|$|The British Standard Fine (BSF) {{standard}} has {{the same}} thread angle as the BSW, but has a finer <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and smaller <b>thread</b> depth. This is more like the modern [...] "mechanical" [...] screw and was used for fine machinery and for steel bolts.|$|R

40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as <b>thread</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, <b>thread</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth, thread width and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.

2500|$|Improvements in {{tool design}} {{have been shown}} to cause {{substantial}} improvements in productivity and quality. TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the [...] "whorl" [...] design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable <b>pitch</b> <b>thread</b> to improve the downwards flow of material. Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the combined effect of macro and <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> on {{primary and secondary}} stability during healing, but before dynamic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of turned implants with different macro geometry were prepared. The test group possessed <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> in between the large threads and the control group did not have thread alterations. The two implant groups were placed in both femur and tibiae of 10 lop-eared rabbits, {{and at the time}} of implant insertion, insertion torques were recorded. After 4 weeks, all implants were subjected to removal torque tests. RESULTS: The insertion torque values for the control and test groups for the tibia were 15. 7 and 20. 6 Ncm, respectively, and for the femur, 11. 8, and 12. 8 Ncm respectively. The removal torque values for the control and test groups in the tibia were 7. 9 and 9. 1 Ncm, respectively, and for the femur, 7. 9 and 7. 7 Ncm respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the control and test groups. CONCLUSION: Under limited dynamic load, the addition of <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> did not significantly improve either the primary or the secondary stability of the implants in bone...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Thread</b> limit or <b>pitch</b> {{diameter}} {{limit is}} a standard used for classifying the tolerance of the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> diameter for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 <b>pitch</b> <b>thread</b> = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|R
