40|$|The {{suitability}} of commercial (terrestrial) solar arrays {{for use in}} low Earth orbit is examined. It is shown that commercial solar arrays degrade under thermal cycling because of <b>material</b> <b>flexure,</b> and that certain types of silicones used {{in the construction of}} these arrays outgas severely. Based on the results, modifications were made. The modified array retains the essential features of typical commercial arrays and can be easily built by commercial fabrication techniques at low cost. The modified array uses a metal tray for containment, but eliminates the high outgassing potting materials and glass cover sheets.

The modified array is found to withstand severe thermal cycling for long intervals of time...|$|E
40|$|The University of Newcastle has {{undertaken}} a systematic research program to identify, model and measure key design elements {{to reduce the}} energy consumption of belt conveyors. Research outcomes include the development of theoretical models to accurately predict the main resistances of belt conveyors, in parallel with developing extensive test facilities to verify the new models and to provide industry with data {{that can be used}} directly in the design process. This paper discusses the application of these models and test results for conveyor design, demonstrating the advantages of informed component selection to not only reduce energy consumption, but also total cost of ownership. In particular, the combination of design parameters is discussed in relation to the rotating resistance of idler rollers, conveyor belt indentation rolling resistance and conveyor belt and bulk <b>material</b> <b>flexure</b> resistance.

40|$|Monolithic SiC and Si 3 N 4 are {{susceptible}} to contact stress damage at static and sliding interfaces. Transformation-toughened zirconia (TTZ) was evaluated under sliding contact conditions {{to determine if the}} higher material fracture toughness would reduce the susceptibility to contact stress damage. Contact stress tests were conducted on four commercially available TTZ materials at normal loads ranging from 0. 455 to 22. 7 kg (1 to 50 pounds) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1204 C (2200 F). Static and dynamic friction were measured as a function of temperature. Flexural strength measurements after these tests determined that the contact stress exposure did not reduce the strength of TTZ at contact loads of 0. 455, 4. 55, and 11. 3 kg (1, 10, and 25 pounds). Prior testing with the lower toughness SiC and Si 3 N 4 materials resulted in a substantial strength reduction at loads of only 4. 55 and 11. 3 kg (10 and 25 pounds). An increase in material toughness appears to improve ceramic material resistance to contact stress damage. Baseline <b>material</b> <b>flexure</b> strength was established and the stress rupture capability of TTZ was evaluated. Stress rupture tests determined that TTZ materials {{are susceptible}} to deformation due to creep and that aging of TTZ materials at elevated temperatures results in a reduction of material strength...|$|E

40|$|Flexures are {{mechanical}} elements used in micro- and precision-engineering {{to precisely}} guide {{the motion of}} micro-parts. They consist of slender bodies that deform elastically upon {{the application of a}} force. Although counter-intuitive at first, fused silica is an attractive <b>material</b> for <b>flexure.</b> Pending that the machining process does not introduce surface flaws that would lead to catastrophic failure, the material has a theoretically high ultimate tensile strength of several GPa. We report on high-aspect ratio fused silica flexures manufactured by femtosecond laser combined with chemical etching.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the complex {{geological}} evolution of Valles Marineris, Mars, has been highly influenced by the manifestation of magmatism (e. g., possible plume activity). This {{is based on a}} diversity of evidence, reported here, for the central part, Melas Chasma, and nearby regions, including uplift, loss of huge volumes of <b>material,</b> <b>flexure,</b> volcanism, and possible hydrothermal and endogenic-induced outflow channel activity. Observations include: (1) the identification of a new > 50 km-diameter caldera/vent-like feature on the southwest flank of Melas, which is spatially associated with a previously identified center of tectonic activity using Viking data; (2) a prominent topographic rise at the central part of Valles Marineris, which includes Melas Chasma, interpreted to mark an uplift, consistent with faults that are radial and concentric about it; (3) HiRISE-identified landforms along the floor of the southeast part of Melas Chasma that are interpreted to reveal a volcanic field; (4) CRISM identification of sulfate-rich outcrops, which could be indicative of hydrothermal deposits; (5) GRS K/Th signature interpreted as water–magma interactions and/or variations in rock composition; and (6) geophysical evidence that may indicate partial compensation of the canyon and/or higher density intrusives beneath it. Long-term magma, tectonic, and water interactions (Late Noachian into the Amazonian), albeit intermittent, point to an elevated life potential, and thus Valles Marineris is considered a prime target for future life detection missions...|$|E
40|$|Transfemoral {{prostheses}} {{are often}} {{covered with a}} flexible Polyurethane foam cosmesis to provide an aesthetic finish and protect the mechanical components. Despite its flexibility, the cosmesis is known to hinder prosthetic joint movement and alter amputee gait particularly in the swing phase. In fact amputees can be advised to keep the limb in full flexion {{for a period of}} time when the limb is first issued in order to stretch the cosmesis and reduce its impact on joint movement. Over time the cosmesis ruptures, typically in the knee area, due to repeated <b>material</b> <b>flexure</b> during gait. Although the cosmesis limitations are evident in clinical practice, the information is largely anecdotal; the impact of the polyurethane cosmesis on the function of the prosthesis has not been addressed in the scientific literature. The aim of this study was to determine if the cosmesis affects the mechanical performance of the prosthesis and consequently alters amputee gait. Three transfemoral amputees were voluntarily recruited for the study (Strathclyde University ethics approval) conducted in a gait analysis laboratory using a VICON (MODEL?) motion analysis system. Temporal gait parameters and joint angles were recorded as the subjects walked at a self-selected speed along a 12 metre level surface under two test conditions: without wearing a cosmesis and wearing a newly fitted cosmesis. Surface markers were attached to the prosthesis or cosmesis at standardised landmarks for kinematic measurement. Differences were measured in the swing phase gait parameters with and without a cosmesis. This is likely to reduce over time as the cosmesis wears. Consequently longitudinal adjustments may be required to accommodate for the cosmesis effect on the mechanical performance of the prosthesis. The findings pose the question why the advanced prosthetic components optimally set up for each amputee are covered with a cosmesis which hinders their operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} flexure {{problem of}} non-linear incompressible elasticity is revisited for elastic materials whose mechanical response {{is different in}} tension and compression - the so-called bimodular <b>materials.</b> The <b>flexure</b> problem is chosen to investigate this response since the two regions, one of tension and one of compression, can be identified easily using simple intuition. Two distinct problems are considered: the first is where the stress is assumed continuous across the boundary of the two regions, which assumption has a sound physical basis. The second problem considered is core speculative: it is where discontinuities of stress are allowed. It is shown that such discontinuities are necessarily small for many applications, but might nonetheless provide {{an explanation for the}} damage incurred by repeated flexure.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of blending of metakaolin with silica rich palm oil fuel ash (POFA) on the strength distribution of geopolymer mortar. The broadness of strength distribution of quasi-brittle to brittle materials depends strongly {{on the existence of}} flaws such as voids, microcracks, and impurities in the material. Blending of materials containing alumina and silica with the objective of improving the performance of geopolymer makes comprehensive characterization necessary. The Weibull distribution is used to study the strength distribution and the reliability of geopolymer mortar specimens prepared from 100 % metakaolin, 50 % and 70 % palm and cured under ambient condition. Mortar prisms and cubes were used to test the <b>materials</b> in <b>flexure</b> and compression, respectively, at 28 days and the results were analyzed using Weibull distribution. In flexure, Weibull modulus increased with POFA replacement, indicating reduced broadness of strength distribution from an increased homogeneity of the material. Modulus, however, decreased with increase in replacement of POFA in the specimens tested under compression. It is concluded that Weibull distribution is suitable for analyses of the blended geopolymer system. While porous microstructure is mainly responsible for flexural failure, heterogeneity of reaction relics is responsible for the compression failure...|$|R

Callaway processes the prepreg in-house and supplied 254 mm x 254 mm x 1. 3 mm panels of carbon fiber {{sheet molding compound}} (CFSMC) for characterizing. Tensile strength was analyzed by conducting tensile tests per ASTM D 3039. Tensile coupons were cut to 254 mm long by 25. 4 mm wide. Tabs were constructed from 1. 6 mm thick GFRP printed circuit board material. A commercial grade two part epoxy was used to bond the tabs to the CFSMC. Tensile results were inconclusive due to consistent fractures occurring outside the gauge lengths of the specimens. Flexure strength was analyzed by conducting 3 -point bend tests per ASTM D 790. ASTM D 790 calls for a larger than normal support span-to-coupon thickness ratio of 32 : 1 for high strength composites. The support span was therefore set to 42. 6 mm.

40|$|Airframe {{noise is}} a {{significant}} component of environmental noise {{in the vicinity of}} airports. The noise associated with the leading-edge slat of typical transport aircraft is a prominent source of airframe noise. Previous work suggests that a slat-cove filler (SCF) may be an effective noise treatment. Hence, development and optimization of a practical slat-cove-filler structure is a priority. The objectives of this work are to optimize the design of a functioning SCF which incorporates superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) <b>materials</b> as <b>flexures</b> that permit the deformations involved in the configuration change. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the actuation force needed to retract the slat-SCF assembly while satisfying constraints on the maximum SMA stress and on the SCF deflection under static aerodynamic pressure loads, while also satisfying the condition that the SCF self-deploy during slat extension. A finite element analysis model based on a physical bench-top model is created in Abaqus such that automated iterative analysis of the design could be performed. In order to achieve an optimized design, several design variables associated with the current SCF configuration are considered, such as the thicknesses of SMA flexures and the dimensions of various components, SMA and conventional. Designs of experiment (DOE) are performed to investigate structural response to an aerodynamic pressure load and to slat retraction and deployment. DOE results are then used to inform the optimization process, which determines a design minimizing actuator forces while satisfying the required constraints...|$|R

IET has become a widely accepted standard method for the determination of accurate stiffness and damping values for monolithic materials.

40|$|A reaction-bonded {{silicon carbide}} (RB-SiC) ceramic {{material}} (Carborundum's Cerastar RB-SIC) has been joined using a reaction forming approach. Microstructure and mechanical properties of {{three types of}} reaction-formed joints (350 micron, 50 - 55 micron, and 20 - 25 micron thick) have been evaluated. Thick (approximately 350 micron) joints consist mainly of silicon {{with a small amount}} of silicon carbide. The flexural strength of thick joints is about 44 plus or minus 2 MPa, and fracture always occurs at the joints. The microscopic examination of fracture surfaces of specimens with thick joints tested at room temperature revealed the failure mode to be typically brittle. Thin joints (< 50 - 55 micron) consist of silicon carbide and silicon phases. The room and high temperature flexural strengths of thin (< 50 - 55 micron) reaction-formed joints have been found to be at least equal to that of the bulk Cerastar RB-SIC <b>materials</b> because the <b>flexure</b> bars fracture away from the joint regions. In this case, the fracture origins appear to be inhomogeneities inside the parent material. This was always found to be the case for thin joints tested at temperatures up to 1350 C in air.

40|$|Actuator is a {{fluid control}} component, {{which will be}} used in any of the fluid control requirements. The {{proposed}} actuator is normally closed and electro-mechanically actuated with armature configuration. The armature movement is the path opening to facilitate the actuator flow and is controlled by the flexure positioned over the armature. Flexure not only provides the armature movement but also guides in the designed path. Configuration and thickness of flexure plays vital role in the actuator design. Three configurations have been studied for this application. By considering the fabrication feasibility, flexure third configuration has been conceptualised for the actuator. Analysis has been carried out for the third configuration by considering the <b>flexure</b> <b>material</b> as SS 302. Based on design requirement, flexure has to travel by 0. 3 mm maximum on both sides from neutral position to get the desired armature movement of 0. 6 mm. Three variants of thickness viz., 100, 150 and 250 microns are selected for the flexure third configuration. By flexure stiffness analysis, {{it is clear that the}} force required for achieving the desired deflection of 0. 30 mm for 150 microns thickness is nominal and is extent of 0. 8 N.

The device is produced using a 100 -micron thick silicon wafer as a substrate with 0. 5 -micron thick silicon nitride shutters on top of it.

40|$|The {{response}} of samples of unidirectional and cross-ply Nicalon fibre-reinforced calcium aluminosilicate (CAS) {{to a variety}} of thermal regimes has been examined using microscopy techniques and retained mechanical property measurements. The degree of matrix damage has been investigated by observation and measurement of cracking features and the results used in simple models in order to relate the occurrence of matrix cracking to stress distributions in the laminates. Thermal shock induced matrix crack damage was first seen to appear on the end faces of the unidirectional [0] 16 laminate at a temperature differential of 400 °C and in the transverse plies, parallel to the longitudinal fibre direction, in the [0 / 90] 3 s cross-ply composite at a temperature differential of 350 °C. At more severe thermal shocks the next damage in both laminates was cracking in the matrix perpendicular to the fibre direction. The density of matrix cracking was seen to increase, initially, with increasing severity of thermal shock, but then to be less extensive at the highest temperature differentials (800 °C) used in this study. Crack density data for the unidirectional material at increasingly severe thermal shocks were compared with literature data for cracking under quasi-static loading using a simple thermal shock analysis incorporating a stress reduction factor. The effect of matrix cracking on retained mechanical properties has been examined by means of three-point flexure testing and values for Young's modulus, onset of non-linear behaviour and retained strength of the composites have been determined. Multiple thermal shock tests indicated that thermal treatment of previously cracked samples accelerated the rate of deterioration in the retained properties of the composite. It was proposed that the {{response of}} the samples to changes in the duration and severity of thermal treatments was consistent with interfacial modifications that have been reported to occur in this composite system at elevated temperatures. The suitability of applying a modified ACK model to predict critical temperature differentials for matrix cracking in the unidirectional laminate and longitudinal plies in the cross-ply composite has been tested. This approach combined applied thermal stresses, calculated using the simple thermal shock formula, with residual stresses, obtained from the model proposed by Powell et at. (1993). This method was found to be valid for the unidirectional material providing that some of the key parameters were determined independently. The use of a tunnelling crack model to predict thermal shock induced matrix cracking in the transverse plies of the cross-ply composite was less successful. This was partially attributed to the observed cracking patterns generated in the cross-ply <b>material</b> by <b>flexure</b> tests not conforming to those expected from stress calculations or reported from tensile tests...|$|R
40|$|A motor {{involves}} a simple design {{that can be}} embedded into a plate structure by incorporating ultrasonic horn actuators into the plate. The piezoelectric material that is integrated into the horns is pre-stressed with flexures. Piezoelectric actuators are attractive {{for their ability to}} generate precision high strokes, torques, and forces while operating under relatively harsh conditions (temperatures at single-digit K to as high as 1, 273 K). Electromagnetic motors (EM) typically have high rotational speed and low torque. In order to produce a useful torque, these motors are geared down to reduce the speed and increase the torque. This gearing adds mass and reduces the efficiency of the EM. Piezoelectric motors can be designed with high torques and lower speeds directly without the need for gears. Designs were developed for producing rotary motion based on the Barth concept of an ultrasonic horn driving a rotor. This idea was extended to a linear motor design by having the horns drive a slider. The unique feature of these motors is that they can be designed in a monolithic planar structure. The design is a unidirectional motor, which is driven by eight horn actuators, that rotates in the clockwise direction. There are two sets of flexures. The flexures around the piezoelectric <b>material</b> are pre-stress <b>flexures</b> and they pre-load the piezoelectric disks to maintain their being operated under compression when electric field is applied.

Piezoelectric transducers, employed ubiquitously in nanopositioning applications are then discussed in detail including practical considerations and constraints on transducer response. The reader is then given an overview of the types of nanopositioner before the text turns to the in-depth coverage of mechanical design including <b>flexures,</b> <b>materials,</b> manufacturing techniques, and electronics. This process is illustrated by the example of a high-speed serial-kinematic nanopositioner. Position sensors are then catalogued and described and the text then focuses on control. Several forms of control are treated: shunt control, feedback control, force feedback control and feedforward control (including an appreciation of iterative learning control). Performance issues are given importance as are problems limiting that performance such as hysteresis and noise which arise in the treatment of control and are then given chapter-length attention in their own right.

40|$|High-power {{ultrasonic}} actuators {{are generally}} assembled with a horn, backing, stress bolt, piezoelectric rings, and electrodes. The manufacturing process is complex, expensive, difficult, and time-consuming. The internal stress bolt {{needs to be}} insulated and presents a potential internal discharge point, which can decrease actuator life. Also, {{the introduction of a}} center hole for the bolt causes many failures, reducing the throughput of the manufactured actuators. A new design has been developed for producing ultrasonic horn actuators. This design consists of using flexures rather than stress bolts, allowing one to apply pre-load to the piezoelectric material. It also allows one to manufacture them from a single material/plate, rapid prototype them, or make an array in a plate or 3 D structure. The actuator is easily assembled, and application of pre-stress greater than 25 MPa was demonstrated. The horn consists of external flexures that eliminate the need for the conventional stress bolt internal to the piezoelectric, and reduces the related complexity. The stress bolts are required in existing horns to provide prestress on piezoelectric stacks when driven at high power levels. In addition, the manufacturing process benefits from the amenability to produce horn structures with internal cavities. The removal of the pre-stress bolt removes a potential internal electric discharge point in the actuator. In addition, it significantly reduces the chances of mechanical failure in the piezoelectric stacks that result from the hole surface in conventional piezoelectric actuators. The novel features of this disclosure are: 1. A design that can be manufactured from a single piece of metal using EDM, precision machining, or rapid prototyping. 2. Increased electromechanical coupling of the horn actuator. 3. Higher energy density. 4.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 46 - 47) Nanoindentation is {{a technique}} developed {{over the last two}} decades for studying the mechanical properties of materials at micro or nano scales. The availability of depth-sensing indentation instruments with capabilities for measuring displacements on the order of nanometers now makes it possible to study mechanical properties of finely structured materials where small volumes need to be probed. Flexure-based compliant mechanisms have been used in an ultra-precision stage, stage for nano imprint machines, AFM scanner, and MEMS structures, etc. Flexure stages employ a non-conventional flexure bearing' mechanism in the system, in which the moving platform is linked to a static base by flexure hinges. The platform's movement, driven by piezo actuators, is guided by the flexure mechanism. The guiding motion is generated by elastic deformation of the <b>flexure</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, the linkage is friction and stiction free, resulting in smooth motion. This thesis discusses the development of Nanoindentation system with a flexure-hinged mechanism. The key components which the system consists are: Flexure based linear motion stage (the Z-axis stage) that provides vertical positioning of the tool tip in addition to measuring the contact load of the tool upon the sample, Berkovich indenter is used as a tool tip and flexure based stage (the XY-stage) for positioning the sample horizontally below the tool. As load is applied to the indenter and sample, reaction forces cause the load frame to be elastically deflected. This can lead to an overestimate of penetration depth into the sample. Thus actual penetration depth is found by subtracting the load frame deflection out of the load-depth curve. To verify the system performance, we conducted standard indentation tests on a fused silica sample and a nickel specimen prepared by Current Activated Tip-based Sintering (CATS). For fused silica, hardness and elastic modulus determined through testing were shown to be close to literature values and for nickel sintered specimen the hardness determined through testing were shown to be close to the results determined from the Vickers test...|$|R

Polymer flow through the extruder is modeled as pipe flow with pressure drops using Bernoulli's equation with viscous losses; the model predicts that the pressure required to extrude is proportional to 1 /d⁴', where d is the nozzle diameter. Three different extruder designs are considered; a piston-based design, an auger-based design, and a pinch-wheel design. The pinch wheel design best meets the functional requirements after comparing the designs based on factors such as complexity and controllability. Flexural bearings are selected to provide a preload against the polymer filament; HDPE was chosen to be the <b>flexure</b> <b>material</b> after considering factors such as water-jet machinability and yield stress to elastic modulus ratio. Thermal imaging shows that the temperature profile along the heater barrel is not uniform, with the largest variation being 80 ± 2. 8 °C in large part due to errors in heater wire distribution during assembly. An exponential relationship is observed between the force required to extrude versus {{the temperature of the}} heater barrel with the force required to extrude dropping to between 1 and 2 N in the range of 200 to 240 °C. This data suggests trade-offs between maintaining a reasonable extruding pressure and maintaining good build resolution and speed. A discussion of the low cost rapid prototyping cycle follows, as well as instructions for assembly and use of the extruder. The paper ends with several suggestions to improve extruder performance and a list of ideas for bringing the extruder costs down. by Aaron Eduardo Ramirez. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Although the {{technique}} of external strengthening of reinforced concrete beams using externally bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials has been established as an effective tool for rehabilitating and strengthening reinforced concrete beams, it is still suffering from some drawbacks. A significant part of these drawbacks is attributed to the characteristics of currently available FRP strengthening systems. This study deals with the development and evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} two innovative ductile FRP systems for flexural/shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams. The systems are fabrics that are hybrid of glass and carbon fibers and designed to have the potential to avoid most of the drawbacks experienced by currently available FRP strengthening systems. The new systems are unique as they can provide yield plateaus similar to that provided by steel in tension. The ideal characteristics of a strengthening <b>material</b> for both <b>flexure</b> and shear were investigated. A parametric study was conducted on the loading behavior of triaxially braided fabrics. Based on these investigations, the systems were designed and manufactured. An experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in flexure/shear using the new systems. Reinforced concrete simple and continuous beams were strengthened in flexural/shear using the new systems applying different strengthening schemes. Identical beams were strengthened using some commercially available carbon fiber sheets, fabrics, and plates, as well as steel plates, in order to compare their behavior with those strengthened with the developed systems. The beams were loaded until failure and their responses were investigated for ductility, FRP exploitability, and failure modes. The beams strengthened in flexure with the new systems exhibited greater ductility than those strengthened with the carbon fiber strengthening systems and produced yield plateaus {{similar to those of the}} unstrengthened beams and also to those strengthened using steel plates. The test results showed that the strengths of the new systems were fully exploited. Guidelines for the design of the developed systems for flexural and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams were presented. Numerical examples of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in flexure or shear were also presented in order to clarify the design procedures. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
