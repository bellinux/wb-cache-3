500|$|Elizabeth's senior adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His {{political}} mantle {{passed to}} his son, Robert Cecil, who soon became {{the leader of}} the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and [...] "secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions". The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: [...] "So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort". In historian J. E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with [...] "unmistakable if veiled phrases".|$|E
500|$|After VE Day, the Churchills first {{returned}} to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to {{be greeted by}} what the horticulturalist and garden historian Stefan Buczacki describes as, [...] "the biggest crowd Westerham had ever seen". But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the June 1945 general election. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return – [...] "it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone". Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by Lord Camrose, raised the sum of £55,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for the sum of £43,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of £350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50 year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, {{at which point the}} property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, [...] "I feel how inadequate <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years".|$|E

2500|$|From 1601, in {{the last}} years of Elizabeth I's life, certain English politicians, notably her chief {{minister}} Sir Robert Cecil, maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. Cecil advised James not to press the matter of the succession upon the queen but simply to treat her with kindness and respect. The approach proved effective: [...] "I trust that you will not doubt," [...] Elizabeth wrote to James, [...] "but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them you in grateful sort." [...] In March 1603, with the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne. Strategic fortresses were put on alert, and London placed under guard. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March. Within eight hours, James was proclaimed king in London, the news received without protest or disturbance.|$|E

2500|$|Series three – {{the first}} Out of the Unknown series {{to be made}} in colour – was {{broadcast}} on Wednesday nights beginning on 7 January 1969 with the episode, “Immortality, Inc.”. One viewer of “Immortality, Inc.” was Beatle George Harrison who can be seen discussing the episode with Ringo Starr in the film Let It Be. Scheduled opposite the very popular ITV drama series The Power Game, the series suffered in the ratings and met with mixed reviews; the Daily Express found the series “most erratic”, sometimes “wonderfully inventive” but at other times “as silly as a comic strip in a child's magazine”. The production of “Random Quest” led its author, John Wyndham, to write to director Christopher Barry praising “the hard work and ingenuity of a great number of people concerned [...] excellent work by everybody – not forgetting the adapter. <b>My</b> <b>thanks</b> to everyone [...] for weaving it all together so skillfully”. “Beach Head” was entered into the Sixth Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza in July 1968, in the hope of repeating the earlier success of “The Machine Stops”, but did not win.|$|E
2500|$|Addressing Hamilton College students, Lord {{spoke of}} the {{necessity}} of the inclusion of the supernatural in Christian theology:A strong critic of Islam, in his lecture [...] "The Romance of History," [...] Lord defended the Crusades and harshly condemned the control of the Holy Land by Muslims, and also encouraged the conversion of the Jews:Lord publicized his view opposing slavery during the early 1850s, with a sermon published in newspapers in which he concludes that although God does not condone the practice, citizens have no right to oppose it as a legal and constitutional institution. The sermon caused a national controversy, as some incorrectly interpreted Lord's view as being that the government can essentially make legal any sinful action legal or mandatory, including murder and theft, among others. He was called a Judas and a Benedict Arnold, although the controversy simmered out fairly quickly as his true views became clarified. Indeed, he was eventually commended by fellow clerics, and by President Millard Fillmore, who sent him the following letter: [...] Washington, D.C., Jan. 13, 1851'Rev. J. C. Lord, [...] My Dear Sir: “The cares of state” leave me no time for general reading, and it was not till this evening, that I found leisure to peruse your admirable sermon on the “Higher Law and Fugitive Slave Bill.” I return you <b>my</b> <b>thanks,</b> most cordially and sincerely, for this admirable discourse.

2500|$|In March 1954, Orwig {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} as the athletic director at the University of Nebraska for $12,600 a year. [...] He remained at Nebraska until 1961, and during his tenure the Corhuskers started to emerge into national prominence. [...] Orwig was responsible during his seven years at Nebraska for creating the Touchdown Club, the Extra Point Club and the Husker Athletic Achievement Awards. [...] However, the football team did not fare well during Orwig's time there, as the football program went through three coaches (Bill Glassford, Pete Elliott, and Bill Jennings), and had a 27–44 record. [...] Orwig was the athletic director who hired Pete Elliott as the football coach at Nebraska in 1956. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I thought the world of him. I {{thought he was a}} great guy." [...] In 1961, Orwig quit his position at Nebraska to accept the athletic director job at Indiana; news reports indicated that Orwig had been offered $20,000 a year by Indiana, $5,000 more than he was making at Nebraska. [...] At the time, Orwig said: [...] "The decision to accept the Indiana University position as Director of Athletics was a most difficult one[...] [...] [...] The people of Nebraska and the University have been most kind to me over the past 7 years.
