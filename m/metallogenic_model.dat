The Aketasi gold deposit, located in Fuyun County，Xinjiang，has some characteristics of subvolcanic-strucural altered type gold deposit. The <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> can be generalized that Beitashan Formation of mid-Devonian {{was the original}} mineral source，and then plagiogranite emplace along the deep fracture, activating and extracting the gold element, achieving the first enrichment. The subsequent fault and the hydrothermal activities lead to the secondary enrichment of gold element,finally form Aketasi gold deposit. The inside and outside contact of plagiogranite rocks，the zone with mercury vapor anomalies and the geochemical anomaly aera of Au Ag are the favorable for gold deposits. Introuduction The Aketasi gold deposit, located 40 km southeast of Fuyun County, is controversial in ore genesis. Some consider the Aketasi gold deposit {{as a kind of}} magmatic hydrothermal deposit [1] or a mesothermal lode deposit [2], while others believe that the Aketasit is a epithermal gold deposit, [3]. Whereas, the exploration of Aketasi deposit has been inadequate, which lead to the knowledge being not definite.

40|$|Macedonia {{is located}} in the Serbian–Macedonian sector of the Eurasian Tethys metallogenic belt (Fig. 1). Mineralization related to Cenozoic {{activation}} in this area is expressed in the formation of a volcanoplutonic complex in the dispersed spreading setting [1]. Previous joint works with Macedonian geologists made it possible to establish that the present-day tectonic structure of Macedonia reflects dislocations closely related to Cenozoic magmatism and productive mineralization [2]. The Kadica–Bukovik ore district {{is located in}} the easternmost Surdulica–Osogovo–Pasos metallogenic zone characterized by the wide development of lead– zinc mineralization (Fig. 1). The zone incorporates systems of sheeted bodies and discordant dikes of quartz latites with an absolute age within 24 – 12 Ma. Recent discovery of the gold-bearing porphyry copper mineralization in the eastern Kadica ore district is inconsistent with its metallogenic specialization and previous <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> of this belt [2].

40|$|Identification of a {{new type}} {{mineralization}} often leads to discovery of {{a great number of}} ore deposits and ore provinces. Predicting and identifying new type mineralizations is an important aim of ore deposit study. To date the majority of orogenic-type gold deposits has been well shown by worldwide studies. However, the other commodities of orogenic-type are rarely discussed. This paper addresses the concept of orogenic-type deposits which formed by fluid systems mainly sourced from metamorphic devolatilization. The paper also develops genetic models for orogenic deposits at various scales, including deposit -, orefield/terrain - and province/orogen -scales. The genetic models are linked to a three -stage tectonic evolution of convergent orogens. According to these models, the transition from compression to extension of thickened accretionary or/and collisional orogens is conducive to mineralizations; and the syn -orogenic ore -systems must be characteristically lagged behind compressional orogenesis. As case studies, orogenic -type silver, lead -zinc, molybdenum and copper deposits are reported in the paper. This implies that China has great potential for orogenic-type deposits. The logics and validity of the <b>metallogenic</b> <b>models</b> are evidenced by introduction of several successful ore deposit prediction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Small mesothermal vein quam-gold-base-metal sulfide {{deposits}} {{from which}} some 20 t of Au-Ag bullion have been extracted, {{are the most}} common gold deposits in the Georgetown region of north Queensland-several hundred were mined or prospected between 1870 and 1950. These deposits are mostly hosted by Proterozoic granitic and metamorphic rocks and are similar to the much larger Charters Towers deposits such as Day Dawn and Brilliant, and in some respects to the Motherlode deposits of California. The largest deposit in the region-Kidston (> 138 t of Au and Ag since 1985) - is substantially different. It is hosted by sheeted quartz veins and cavities in brecciated Silurian granite and Proterozoic metamorphics above nested high-level Carboniferous intrusives associated with a nearby cauldron subsidence structure. This paper provides new information (K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotopic ages, preliminary oxygen isotope and fluid-inclusion data) from some of the mesothermal deposits and compares it with the Kidston deposit. All six dated mesothermal deposits have Siluro-Devonian (about 425 to 400 Ma) ages. All nine of such deposits analysed have delta(18) O quartz values in the range 8. 4 to 15. 7 parts per thousand, Fluid-inclusion data indicate homogenisation temperatures in the range 230 - 350 degrees C. This information, and a re-interpretation of the spatial relationships of the deposits with various elements of the updated regional geology, is used to develop a preliminary <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> of the mesothermal Etheridge Goldfield. The model indicates how the majority of deposits may have formed from hydrothermal systems initiated during the emplacement of granitic batholiths that were possibly, but not clearly, associated with Early Palaeozoic subduction, and that these fluid systems were dominated by substantially modified meteoric and/or magmatic fluids. The large Kidston deposit and a few small relatives are of Carboniferous age and formed more directly from magmatic systems much closer to the surface...|$|E
40|$|International audienceApatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (OH, F, Cl)) is an {{ubiquitous}} accessorymineral {{found in}} many types of rocks and environments. Thismineral has several key features for the characterizationand/or the dating of fluid circulation or magmatismresponsible for the emplacement of mineralization: 1. It often incorporates uranium during its crystallization. This makes it an excellent candidate for U-Pb dating. Moreover, apatite can also be dated by the fission tracks and(U-Th) /He methods. Therefore the same mineral can bringinformation on {{the age of the}} mineralization and itsexhumation history. 2. Apatite is an excellent trap for the P, F, Cl, OH, butalso for Rare Earth Elements (REE) [1]. 3. This mineral can easily react in the presence of brines,or aqueous fluids containing CO 2, HCl, H 2 SO 4 and/or F [2]. 4. In many ore deposit, the crystallization of apatite iscontemporaneous with mineralization processes [3]. 5. Its closure temperature with respect to the U-Pb system(375 - 550 °C) gives it a peculiar role for dating hydrothermalevents [4]. Accordingly, apatite is, a priori, an excellent proxy forobtaining extensive information about mineralizing fluidsand/or fertile magmas (temperatures, compositions and agesor durations of the events), information that is essential forestablishing a <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model.</b> We will present a comprehensive set of CL imaging,EPMA analyses, SIMS stable isotopes and U-Pb dating onapatite from several ore deposits in order to assess thepotential of this mineral for the study of ore deposits.

40|$|National audienceThe South African Witwatersrand Basin on the Kaapvaal Craton is {{the largest}} gold deposit {{in the world but}} the <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> is still not clear; the debate {{revolves}} mostly around the role of syngenetic (placer) vs. epigenetic hydrothermal processes. However, it is clear that several fluid events have been recorded throughout the basin. Consequently, it is important to determine the scale of these fluid circulations. For that purpose, we sampled calcite-quartz veins in three goldfields in close vicinity to gold-bearing reefs. In addition, we systematically sampled their host rocks (sedimentary or mafic rocks) in order to investigate the effects of rock-fluid interactions. We performed oxygen and carbon isotope analyses on both the veins and their host rocks, as well as a fluid inclusion study. We show that the oxygen isotope composition of quartz in veins is buffered by the host sedimentary rocks. It is therefore not possible to determine the nature of the original fluid. Another result is that carbon isotopes analyses in quartz-calcite veins hosted by mafic rocks present a range of values that suggest two distinct sources, regardless of their location within the Witwatersrand Basin. One end member is represented by organic matter found locally within the basin sedimentary rocks whereas the second end-member has a marine signature. The most likely candidate for this marine signature is the overlying limestones from the Chuniespoort Group. This implies a basin-scale downward fluid circulation from the overlying rocks down to the basin sedimentary rocks after ca. 2642 - 2432 Ma (age of the Chuniespoort Group deposition). We propose a model of large-scale circulation that allows elements to be transported over long distances within the Witwatersrand Basin. This does not mean that U and Au must have been brought to the basin from external sources, but rather, this means that redistribution of these elements from placer sources may have occurred on a large scale...|$|E

40|$|Global {{geological}} and geophysical data, while routinely used {{in conventional}} plate tectonic studies, {{has not been}} applied to models of an expanding Earth. Crustal reconstructions on Archaean to Recent models of an expanding Earth presented here are {{the first time that}} reconstructions have been extended back to the Archaean, and the first time that continental and oceanic geology has been utilised to constrain plate assemblage and palaeoradius of the Earth. A set of twenty four spherical models have been constructed, twenty three covering the Archaean to Recent and one projected to five million years into the future. Construction of these spherical models relies on the fundamental premise that crustal lithosphere is cumulative with time, and historical markers preserved in the oceanic and continental geology accurately constrain both palaeoradius and plate reconstruction from the Archaean to Recent. Post-Triassic reconstructions of oceanic lithosphere demonstrate a plate fit together along each plate margin at better than 99 % fit. During the Triassic, continents envelope the Earth as a complete continental shell at a reduced Earth radius, and marginal and epi- continental sedimentary basins merge to form a global network surrounding continental cratons and orogenic zones. Continental crust is reconstructed on Pre-Jurassic models using the primary crustal elements of cratons, orogens and basins, with expansion primarily manifested as crustal extension within an established network of epi-continental rifts, orogens and sedimentary basins. By removing all basin and pre-orogenic sediments a primordial proto-Earth at a palaeoradius of approximately 1700 kilometres is achieved during the Mesoproterozoic, comprising assembled cratons and Proterozoic basement rocks. For all models, an intracratonic to intracontinental spatial integrity is maintained throughout Earth history during processes of Precambrian and Palaeozoic continental crustal extension, Late Palaeozoic crustal rupture, Permo-Triassic continental break-up, and Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental dispersal to the Recent. Palaeomagnetic pole data delineate diametrically opposed palaeomagnetic pole clusters for each era back to the Archaean, without the need to consider random crustal dispersion-amalgamation-dispersal cycles. The palaeopole data is further supported by palaeogeographic, palaeobiogeographic, and palaeoclimatic indicators, which define palaeoequators and palaeoclimatic zones consistent with palaeomagnetic determinations. The distribution of latitude dependent lithofacies including glacigenic strata, carbonates, coal, and faunal and floral species is shown to coincide precisely with established palaeopoles and palaeoequators for all expanding Earth models. For climatic and biotic indicators a distinct latitudinal zonation paralleling the established palaeoequator is evident and a distinct northward shift in climatic zonation suggests that an inclined Earth rotational axis, inclined to the pole of the ecliptic, was well established during the Palaeozoic and persists to the Recent. Coastal geography on expanding Earth models shows that large Panthallassa, Tethys and Iapetus Oceans are not required during reconstruction. Instead, epi-continental Panthallassa and lapetus Seas represent precursors to the modem Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Tethys Sea represents a precursor of the present Eurasian continent. Emergent land surfaces during the Precambrian and Phanerozoic equate to the conventional Rodinia, Gondwana and Pangaea supercontinents and smaller subcontinents, and demonstrate a spatial intracratonic and intracontinental integrity throughout Earth history. On each spherical model constructed proto-continental development is evolutionary and defined by a progressive extension of epi-continental sedimentary basins, pulsed orogenesis, eustatic and transgression-regression of epi-continental seas, and opening of modem oceans during the Mesozoic to Recent. <b>Metallogenic</b> <b>modelling</b> of Precambrian and Phanerozoic metal deposits shows a broad global Precambrian metallogenic provinciality coinciding with cratons and intracratonic settings, to regional provinces clustering as specific metal associations. The Phanerozoic metallogenic distribution highlights the abundance of porphyry and granite associated metals concentrated within Phanerozoic orogenic belts, and orogenic belts are shown to crosscut and displace pre-existing Palaeozoic and Precambrian metallogenic provinces. A proposed causal model for Earth expansion has expansion due to an exponential increase in mass with time. Earth expansion then involves an increase in mass by condensation, or segregation of new matter from the Earth's core. This new matter accumulates at the core-mantle interface and the increase in volume results in a swelling of the mantle, which is then manifested in the outer crust as crustal extension. Matter generation within the Earth's core is seen as an endothermic reaction, which will ultimately result in a decay of the matter formation process and cessation of expansion with time...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA 1596 -m-deep {{borehole}} (CS- 1) {{located in}} {{the central part of}} the Cinovec (Zinnwald) granite cupola mineralized in Sn and W intersected zinnwaldite granite (ZG) followed by lithian annite ("protolithionite") granite (PG). These two types of granite are separated by a transition zone (TZ). We studied the chemical composition of major mineral phases (plagioclase, K-feldspar, micas) by EPMA and LA-ICP-MS analyses. The plagioclase composition corresponds to albite (Ab(99. 6 - 91. 1)) containing 0. 09 to 0. 18 wt. % Rb 2 O. Albite crystallized from the magma. K-feldspar is perthitic and shows an increase in Rb concentration (up to 0. 83 wt. % Rb 2 O) in the apical part of the cupola. The partition coefficient K-D-Rb(Mi-Kfs) is constant throughout the cupola, indicating a systematic re-equilibration of these two minerals with fluid. Lithian annite occurs below - 735 m. Its F content decreases with depth and from - 940. 5 m, OH exceeds F. Magnesium and Ti concentrations show a remarkable positive correlation with depth. The TZ and adjacent area are characterized by strong variations in the chemical composition of micas, reflecting the fluctuation of saturation-oversaturation of residual liquid by a F-rich fluid phase. The Rb concentration in zinnwaldite (up to 2 wt. % Rb 2 O) strongly increases in the apical part of the cupola owing to a significant transfer of volatiles. The chemical composition of mica evolves gradually from the TZ to the apical zone. The discovery of lithian annite included in quartz at - 97 m indicates the formation of zinnwaldite by interaction of lithian annite with F-rich fluid. The octahedral site of lithian annite allows the incorporation of Sn, Nb, Ta and W, replacing Ti. Because of the lithian annite -> zinnwaldite transformation, these elements with higher ionic charges are expelled from the mica structure, transferred to the fluid phase and concentrated in the apical part of the cupola. The LA-ICP-MS analyses of the micas confirm this process. We envisage the transport of Sn, Nb, Ta and W in the form of fluorides and the precipitation of cassiterite by hydrolysis of SnF 4. Tungsten was probably transported as H 2 WO 4, resulting from the reaction of WF 6 with H 2 O. A similar behavior of Nb and Ta is suggested. The hydrolysis of fluorides leads to a strong enrichment of fluid in HF, which induced albite instability and formation of greisens. Calculations show that the amounts of Sn and W released by the transformation lithian annite -> zinnwaldite transformation are close to the estimated reserves of these metals within the Cinovec cupola, corroborating the proposed <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E

The Pbsingle bondZnsingle bondAg Tighza deposit {{formed at}} 254 ± 16 Ma, and is clearly {{disconnected from the}} late-Variscan Wsingle bondAu deposit (295 - 280 Ma). The Pbsingle bondZnsingle bondAg mineralization precipitated from a complex hydrothermal fluid. It displays air-normalized 3 He/ 4 He ratio (0. 018 – 0. 103) typical of the upper crust. This crustal component is confirmed by the oxygen and carbon isotope compositions (δ 18 O = + 19 to + 25 ‰; δ 13 C = − 3. 6 to − 11. 2 ‰) and the ɛNd values (− 4. 84 to − 9. 01) of gangue carbonates, which show mixing of (i) fluids that have interacted with late-Carboniferous magmatic rocks, and (ii) fluids in equilibrium with the Paleozoic metasediments. In addition, the Pbsingle bondZnsingle bondAg mineralization has 40 Ar/ 36 Ar values in the range 284 – 315 typical of a meteoric fluid. The radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions (207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 70 – 15. 80 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 30 – 18. 50) suggest leaching of Pb from the surrounding Paleozoic metasediments and late-Variscan granites, whereas the low radiogenic signatures (207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 40 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 05) provide evidence of a deeper source attributed to the lower crust. Crustal thinning related to extensional tectonics in late-Permian and Early-Triassic lead to high-K calc-alkaline to alkaline magmatic activity, which is evidenced by a dense SW-NE-trending dike network that pre-dated the Atlantic Ocean opening (early Liassic times). This magmatic event induced a regional heat flux increase that triggered the circulation of a complex hydrothermal fluid, which has a strong crustal component, but also a meteoric and a lower crustal components. The polymetallic district of Tighza-Jbel Aouam thus results from superposition of an intrusion related porphyry-gold mineralization (Wsingle bondAu, 286 Ma) followed by a Pbsingle bondZnsingle bondAg epithermal mineralization (254 Ma), during two distinct magmatic-hydrothermal events.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} a three-year collaborative research project between the British Geological Survey (BGS), The Natural History Museum, London (NHM) and the Geological Survey Department, Cyprus (GSD). It was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Cyprus. The objectives of the programme were to develop new methodologies for the exploration and exploitation of cupriferous sulphide ore and re-establish metalliferous mineral exploration research on Cyprus and within the GSD. Initially the project only involved the BGS, the NHM and the GSD. However, early on, it became apparent that mining and mineral exploration companies held key datasets, needed to develop the new methodologies. Therefore, negotiations were conducted with the Hellenic Mining Company, Eastern Mediterranean Minerals and Hellenic Copper Mines. These established a framework for collaboration and all parties signed a confidentiality agreement. This allowed the BGS–NHM–GSD team to use proprietary data in their combined metallogenic–prospectivity analysis and the companies to have exclusive access to project results for six months after project completion. The project comprised five distinct components: •	Technology transfer and institutional strengthening. •	Development of new <b>metallogenic</b> <b>models</b> for ophiolite–hosted mineralization, including an examination of gold-rich epithermal-style mineralization associated with submarine basalts. •	Mineralogical and metallurgical analysis of low-grade copper mineralization, with a review of solvent extraction electro-winning (SX-EW) technologies. •	The use of legacy and new data at the regional to district scales for GIS-based prospectivity modelling. This included a reinterpretation of geophysical data. •	A pilot study, using the prospectivity analysis, to define and test the mineralization potential of prospectivity anomalies. To facilitate technology transfer and institutional strengthening the project delivered a number of office and field-based seminars and workshops. These included training in the use of GIS for prospectivity analysis, examination of potential epithermal style mineralization, lectures on: (i) epithermal mineralization in the Aegean, (ii) VHMS mineralization in the Urals and (iii) SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques—these were given to the Cyprus Society of Geologists and Engineers to ensure the widest dissemination. In addition, to give the project an international dimension, the prospectivity analyses were presented at two international conferences in Thessaloniki and Beijing. The project produced, using ArcSDM and a variety of geological, geophysical and remote sensing datasets, two prospectivity investigations: (i) a regional prospectivity map covering all of the Troodos Massif. This identified eight separate areas of high mineralization potential. The areas are generally located within 10 km of the boundary between the Troodos ophiolite and the autochthonous sedimentary cover sequences draping the ophiolite. (ii) A more detailed map focussed on an area of the northern Troodos. This identified drilling targets in the Memi–Alestos area. Key components to the prospectivity analysis undertaken by the project team included: (i) The digitisation of mineral occurrences and gossan distribution. (ii) The analysis of remote sensing data using band ratio image processing techniques to highlight regional alteration trends. (iii) The modelling and interpretation of airborne magnetic geophysics comprised the amalgamation of three generations of data into a single data set and the identification of lineaments and regions with positive and negative magnetic anomalies. In addition to the development of an ophiolite-hosted prospectivity GIS for the Troodos, the project addressed two new metallogenetic concepts for Cyprus—namely (i) The investigation of potential epithermal style VHMS mineralization using infrared spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques. This study identified high temperature advanced argillic alteration phases and concluded that sub-seafloor boiling was responsible for some of the gold enrichment recorded in Cyprus-type VHMS mineralization (ii) The development of low-grade supergene Cu mineralization associated with massive sulphide mineralization. This showed that the favourable interplay between the mineralization and topography {{played an important role in}} the development of the large secondary low-grade orebodies. A strategy for exploring for such a supergene copper target would be to assess all surface gossans developed in topographic highs and seek potential downslope areas of mineralization—the use of high resolution digital elevation models provided by techniques such as LiDAR could be a way forward in this respect Professor John Monhemius, Imperial College London, undertook a review of the use of SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques as applied to Cyprus. This study concluded that the decline in copper recoveries in the heap leach process used at Skouriotissa is due to increasing amounts of primary chalcopyrite, a refractory mineral that is very resistant to dissolution by oxidation, in the run-of-mine ore as mining gets deeper. Recent processes developed for the hydrometallurgical treatment of chalcopyrite all involve the use of extreme conditions, such as high temperature pressure leaching, ultra-fine grinding, or intensified bacterial leaching—these may not be appropriate for Skouriotissa and the best option for extending the life of the plant may be the discovery and exploitation of further reserves of supergene altered copper ores containing leachable copper oxide and secondary sulphide minerals This will allow production to continue using the heap leaching technology currently in use. If necessary, the effectiveness of this leaching method towards secondary copper sulphide minerals could be improved by introducing tanks for bacterially pre-oxidising the leach solutions under optimum conditions, prior to being sprayed on to the ore heaps. One key component of the project was to formulate and implement a pilot project based on the results of the regional GIS. The goal of the pilot project was to site a borehole to test if prospectivity analysis had the capability to predict the location of unknown mineralization. The application of a detailed prospectivity GIS using public domain and proprietary geophysical data focussed on the northern Troodos identified a high prospectivity zone in the Memi–Alestos region. Two boreholes were sited to test for the presence of mineralization beneath Upper Pillow Lava cover and one of these encountered over 20 m of argillically and propylitically altered lavas containing minor amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite. This shows that prospectivity analysis approach used in this project could be a useful tool for locating buried VHMS mineralization on Cyprus. This is especially so when high-resolution geophysical data are available. In terms of future work, the project identified development in the following areas: •	The need for national high-resolution geochemical and geophysical datasets to provide pre-competitive information for mineral exploration and environmental assessment •	The development of fuzzy logic techniques for prospectivity mapping •	Processing and interpretation of high-resolution airborne remote sensing data...|$|R
40|$| {{surrounding}} the different ore deposits has shown tobe {{the most likely}} metal source to these deposits. With regard to the role ofCo, the Co-rich deposits did also display characteristic isotopic signatures,and strongly support the existence of (still unknown) mafic bodies in thebasement that provided the Co to the mineralising fluids. For subsequentmineralisation phases, usually related to the Lufilian orogenesis, theimportance of remobilisation of ore metals is emphasised. The next step forwardin this research domain will be the detailed charactarisation of the localbasement beneath the ore deposits, in order to relate the geochemical signatureof each ore deposit with specific rock units. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"

40|$|International audienceSedimentary units {{deposited}} {{during the}} post-rift {{stage of the}} Erlian Basin located in northeast China present an alternation of sandstone and mudstone layers. This sedimentological architecture is at the origin of confined permeable reservoirs hosting sandstone-type uranium deposits. The study of the Nuheting deposit offered the opportunity to identify synsedimentary/early diagenetic uranium concentrations and diagenetic mineralization hosted in mudstone-dominated layers of the Erlian Formation, indicating that a stock of uranium was present in the basin prior to the genesis of sandstone-hosted uranium deposits. Therefore, this pre-existing stock may constitute {{a significant source of}} uranium for the formation of roll front deposits present {{in other parts of the}} Erlian Basin. Detailed petrographic and geochemical study of drill-core samples from the Nuheting deposit led to the characterization of different stages related to the formation of the uranium ore bodies and allowed to propose a new <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model.</b> Uranium mineralization of the Nuheting deposit is mainly hosted in dark gray silty mudstone of wetland depositional environment of the Late Cretaceous Erlian Formation. Petrographic observations and EMP analyses evidenced that a significant amount of uranium was associated with clay minerals (interstratMed clays, smectite, chlorite, palygorskyte, illite and kaolinite), either adsorbed on mineral surfaces as U (VI) ions or reduced mainly as UO 2 nano to microcrystals disseminated in the clayey matrix, which corresponds to synsedimentary/early diagenetic concentrations. Trace elements on pyrite analyzed by LA-ICPMS, petrographic observations and whole-rock geochemical data led to the characterization of a diagenetic uranium mineralization. High As (1 - 50 ppm), Mo (10 - 500 ppm) and Se concentrations in the whole rock and the incorporation of these elements in pyrite highlight reducing conditions within the host-rocks during the diagenesis of the Erlian Formation. During the early diagenetic stage, uranium was either desorbed from clay minerals and organic materials to be reduced or directly reduced and precipitated as P-rich coffinite and pitchblende on pyrite crystals. During the late diagenetic stage, uranium was redistributed in situ and locally deposited mainly as coffinite on pyrites. Finally, an epigenetic stage of cementation was identified with sulfate and carbonate minerals, which may enclose some uranium minerals. This epigenetic stage of fluid circulation may be responsible for a minor uranium remobilization. Therefore, the Nuheting deposit experienced three main stages: (i) a synsedimentary/ early diagenetic uranium concentration and mineralization, (ii) a late diagenetic in situ uranium remobilization and deposition on pyrite and (iii) an epigenetic cementation. Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicates that the organic matter contained in host-rocks of the Nuheting deposit is of type IV, inherited from land plant, and do not contain free hydrocarbons (very low S 1). Therefore, our results do not support that migrated hydrocarbons were involved as a reducing agent for uranium mineralization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe give {{arguments}} {{showing that}} the Pb Ag Ba F Tl anomalies on the 200 Ma paleo-(sub) surface in western Europe likely have an impact-driven epithermal origin. We propose that they derive from the dust cloud induced by a bolide fall at Rochechouart (NW French Massif Central, France), then removal by rain and percolation along reactivated crustal lineaments. Coeval alterite formation resulted from a greenhouse effect related, and favoured Ba and Pb release from feldspars. I Introduction Impact events are now well recognized as important markers of terrestrial geological history, as well as objects of prime economic potential. World class ore deposits are directly or indirectly related to giant (> 130 km-wide) meteorite craters, e. g., the Sudbury Cu-Ni-PGM ores or the Witwatersrand Au-U mineralizations in Paleoproterozoic cratons (Pirajno 2009). At the scale of North America, the current worth of impact-related valuable substances has been estimated to $ 5 billion per year (Grieve and Masaitis 1994). In hypervelocity impact craters, {{a huge amount of}} kinetic energy is converted to heat. Target rocks are partly molten and vaporized, they are brecciated and comminuted as a compression wave propagates through them. Hot and permeable fall back and fall out ejecta as well as impact-induced fractures below and around the crater are thus favourable settings for post-impact hydrothermal circulations. Based on mineralogy, geochemistry and fluid modelling, the concentrations of Au, U, Pb-Zn sulfides to be found in crater rocks are shown to result from long duration fluid flows (10 3 s to 10 6 years), which extend at the crater-scale and deeper than 1 km below it (e. g., Komor et al. 1988; Naumov 2005). It may seem paradoxical that, whereas terrestrial meteorite impacts may cause global environmental catastrophes (Pierazzo and Artemieva 2012), the economic potential of an impact has seldom been documented to extend at a continental scale so far. In France, the economic importance of the Hettangian paleosurface has long been recognized (e. g., Samama 1980; Lhégu and Touray 1980), but no single unified <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> was ever proposed to account for the complex interplay of hydrothermal and continental weathering processes on this paleosurface. Recently, Schmieder et al. (2010) suggested that some Hettangian Pb-Zn-U-F-Ba mineralizations could be related to the Rochechouart crater (RC), based on their new dating of the impact at 201 ± 2 Ma. Figure 1 a shows the crater, ≈ 20 km in diameter, located on the NW margin of the French Massif Central (FMC) part of the Variscan belt and on the NE edge of the Aquitaine basin. It affected a mixed crystalline target primarily composed of granitic, metamorphic and intrusive igneous rocks of the Variscan orogeny (Lambert 1977, 2010; Chévremont et al. 1996). In this context, we review and discuss some metallogenic and high-energy environmental effects recorded in the lower Hettangian (LH) of western Europe (WE), in the scope of the Rochechouart impact...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to compare the pegmatite-type Nb-Ta-Sn with the vein-type Sn-W deposits of the Mesoproterozoic Karagwe-Ankole Belt (KAB) in Rwanda. Both types of ore deposits are spatially and temporally related to the same granite generation (i. e. G 4 -granites of 986 ± 10 Ma; Tack et al., 2010; Dewaele et al., 2011), but one coherent and combined <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> that links both types of deposits is absent. Research will be carried out on the type and physico-chemical conditions and the geochemical evolution of the mineralising fluids form the Nb-Ta-mineralisation (pegmatites) to the Sn- (pegmatites, hydrothermal quartz veins) and W-mineralisation (hydrothermal quartz veins). Both types of mineralisation will be described and modelled in terms of magmatic and hydrothermal geochemical processes around granite intrusions (G 4 -granites). During {{this research}} the origin and the evolution of the mineralising fluids will be determined. Different techniques will be used to study the mineralisation: minor and trace element geochemistry, stable isotope geochemistry, Laser Raman spectrometry, fluid/melt inclusion microthermometry and [laser ablation] inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ([LA-]ICP-MS). All results will be synthesised and combined with existing data (e. g. Dewaele et al., 2011; De Clercq, 2012) to reconstruct a <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> for granite-related mineralisation in the KAB.

40|$|Mount Dore-style breccia-hosted copper-gold {{deposits}} {{define a}} 70 kilometre-long, north-trending lineament from Kuridala (65 kilometres south of Cloncurry), southwards. The type deposit lies 130 kilometres south of Cloncurry, and a {{detailed study of}} it was undertaken to produce a <b>metallogenic</b> <b>model</b> applicable (with suitable modifications) to all deposits having this style. Regional geology results {{from a combination of}} (i) at least two cycles of ensialic rift sedimentation, (ii) later compressional tectonics and associated metamorphism to a maximum middle amphibolite grade, and (iii) intrusion of late-tectonic granitoids (Beardsmore et al., 1988 and Newbery et al., in prep.). Mount Dore-style deposits are largely restricted to rocks of {{the upper part of the}} Middle Proterozoic Maronan Supergroup, a newly-recognized package of rift-basin sediments. The precise age of this unit is presently unknown; it could belong to either rift episode, or be older or younger. The Mount Dore deposit occurs within steeply east-dipping quartz-muscovite schists and carbonaceous slates of the uppermost Maronan Supergroup structurally overlying meta-calcarenites, calcilutites, marbles and metabasalts of the Staveley Formation. The structural history includes early, subhorizontal (D 1) detachment of the Staveley Formation from older units, followed by upright, northtrending, tight to isoclinal folding (D 2), accompanied by peak metamorphism in the lower to middle amphibolite facies (Jaques et al., 1982). The events are tentatively dated at 1545 Ma, by analogy with D 2 and metamorphic history derived for the western part of the Mount Isa Inlier (Page and Bell, 1986). Northwest-trending corridors of open, upright folds belonging to the D 3 deformation event are scattered across the region, and one of these passes through the Mount Dore orebody. Latest tectonism produced the Mount Dore Fault Zone, a moderately- to steeply east-dipping reverse fault-zone about 250 metres wide, which passes through Mount Dore and reactivates the D 1 structure. The fault zone contains a thin sliver of uppermost Maronan Supergroup, sandwiched between footwall Staveley Formation and hangingwall (truncated) Mount Dore Granite. The granite is dated at 1510 Ma (Nisbet et al., 1983). Mount Dore displays a complex history of brecciation and alteration. Both are related to movement along the Mount Dore Fault Zone and to associated hydrothermal activity. Brecciation was a continuum process, with any particular "event" first producing angular, commonly tabular, crenulated schistose fragments. The crenulation is identified with S 3, but is randomly orientated from clast to clast, arguing for post-D 3 brecciation. Subsequent reworking of the early fragments involved tectonic and hydrothermal milling. Replacement and infill in the breccias are extensive. Early alteration produced Kfeldspar (or biotite), tourmaline, sericite and quartz. Later alteration produced carbonate (dolomite and calcite), apatite and chlorite. All phases are associated with all brecciation styles, but the most pervasive alteration is associated with the intensively milled breccias. Sulphide mineralization is associated temporally with carbonate alteration, and occurs late in the history of development of the Mount Dore deposit. Primary sulphide mineralization comprises pyrite and chalcopyrite, with minor sphalerite and galena. Pyrite is early, and is replaced by the other phases. Chalcocite also clearly replaces earlier pyrite, but is restricted to shallow depths, and probably formed by deep leaching of the deposit during Recent weathering. Alteration, fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry identify a primary deep-seated, hot (> 500 oC?), oxidized, CO 2 -bearing, highly-saline (65 - 70 wt...|$|E
