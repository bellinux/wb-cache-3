40|$|Background: There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} regarding the stressful nature of the teaching profession and an extensive body of literature has shown a multitude of risks and protective factors that influence teachers’ professional well-being. In this framework, a growing interest has been observed in the research dealing {{with the effects of}} combining teaching with another job (<b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding)</b> on teachers’ professional well-being.

Thus, the need for further investigation to clarify the psychological and behavioural consequences of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> for teachers emerges. The present study will contribute to meeting this need by exploring the possible protective role of combining teaching with another job in a large sample of Swiss vocational education and training (VET) teachers in Canton of Ticino.

Conclusions: The study reinforced the positive interpretation of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> as a possible resource for teachers at both the instructional and personal levels. The added value of this condition should be taken into greater consideration at the policy and school levels through the creation of favourable conditions for teachers who are interested in and available to experience additional jobs outside school walls.

30|$|First, our {{findings}} reinforce the positive view of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> and {{provide evidence of}} the relevance of supporting teachers who express an intention of or interest in combining teaching with another job. The positive implications of combining teaching with other jobs has been shown at both the instructional and personal levels, and the added value of such a situation {{should be taken into}} greater consideration at the policy and school levels. However, we are far from considering <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> as the optimal condition for everyone in every context and every phase of one’s teaching career. In particular, we agree with those scholars who emphasise that the positive effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> depend on the voluntary choice to engage in such a condition. From this perspective, on one hand, we consider it important to create institutional conditions that encourage teachers to experience jobs outside the “walls of the school”—even for a restricted period or a restricted number of hours. On the other hand, however, we point out the need to interpret the added value of such an experience in relation to the each teacher’s particular career and personal biography.|$|E
30|$|In {{the next}} paragraph, {{we will discuss}} the {{indirect}} association found between combining teaching with another job and professional well-being {{in the context of}} the literature on <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding.</b> Afterwards, we will discuss possible mechanisms beyond the protective role of combining teaching with another job.|$|E
30|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} regarding the stressful nature of the teaching profession, which can expose teachers to a progressive loss of motivation, satisfaction and sense of competence, even {{to the extent of}} burn-out (Howard and Johnson 2004; Gu and Day 2007; Richardson et al. 2013; Spilt et al. 2011). In this filed, extensive literature has shown a multitude of risk and protective factors that influence professional well-being through dynamic interactions (for a review, see Beltman et al. 2011). In particular, some scholars have questioned the possible beneficial or detrimental effects of combining teaching with another job (i.e. <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding)</b> and a growing interest has been seen in the behavioural and psychological consequences of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> for employees and particularly for teachers. The relevance of investigating this topic is supported by the following.|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} showed that combining teaching with another job has an indirect impact on teachers’ professional well-being by reducing their perceived exposure to threatening factors and related stress. Moreover, <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> helps moderate {{the negative effects}} of school-related challenges as well as the difficulties in balancing work and other activities on professional well-being.|$|E
30|$|First, the {{protective}} role of combining teaching with another job {{may result from}} the fact that being involved in a job besides teaching may encourage teachers to view teaching challenges in a different light by reducing the negative emotional impact of such challenges and by modulating the perceived seriousness of problems. In other words, <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> might help teachers assume a more relativistic perspective of their problems by facilitating a comparison among different professional domains and by evaluating—in a more critical way—the nature of their problems. In addition, this protective role could be contributed to “taking a step back” from a problematic situation by favouring an emotional recovery. The emotionally supportive role of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> was supported by Sliter and Boyd (2014), particularly in cases in which one’s additional job is very satisfactory, is a source of mastery for the individual and is a consequence of a free choice. We have no information about the nature of our participants’ additional jobs, and we also do not know the motives that pushed them to take on a secondary job. However, by considering the satisfactory salary condition of Swiss teachers—at least those employed through full-time contracts—we can assume that <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> was a voluntary choice for most of the teachers in our sample. Consequently, it is plausible to assume that the participants’ secondary jobs would have been left if they were not perceived to be somehow satisfactory. Further studies are, nevertheless, needed to clarify these possibilities.|$|E
30|$|Third, {{as shown}} by Guest and colleagues (Guest et al. 2006), the past {{research}} exploring the effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> are quite heterogeneous, and related findings are still inconsistent. In particular, the terminologies and constructs {{used to describe the}} combining of multiple jobs are varied, including moonlighting (Wilensky 1963), portfolio working (Fenwick 2006), free working (Knell 2000) and boundary-less careers (Arthur 1994). Moreover, two main hypotheses have been adopted to interpret the phenomenon of combining multiple jobs. The first consists of the traditional and negative view, which involves a person seeking a second job because of the constraints of his or her first job (i.e. the deprivation hypothesis). According to this perspective, some scholars underscore the potential negative impacts of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> on individuals, including its possible detrimental effects to job satisfaction, quality of life and performance in the workplace (Parham and Gordon 2011; Arcuri et al. 1987; Maninger et al. 2011). By contrast, the second hypothesis emphasises the positive impacts of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> on individuals’ well-being. For example, Jamal et al. (1998) showed that Canadian teachers who combined teaching with another job reported less burn-out and stress, lower intentions to quit their primary jobs as teachers and higher job performance. The authors interpreted these findings {{within the framework of the}} “energic/opportunity” hypothesis by describing multiple job-holders as individuals who draw psychological and professional advantages—in terms of both personal satisfaction and professional development—from being involved in a variety of professional contexts. An additional inconsistent contribution comes from those studies which support and demonstrate a lack of difference in the job satisfaction of people who hold multiple jobs and those engaged in single jobs (Pearson et al. 1994; Guest et al. 2006). Finally, a number of scholars have questioned the quality and the characteristics of the jobs multiple job-holders are involved in. In particular, Zickar and colleagues (2004) reported the “role conflict” hypothesis, according to which if the primary and secondary jobs are very dissimilar, an employee is more likely to face role conflicts and feel less satisfaction, since more effort is required to shift among the different roles and to adapt roles and behaviours to the different jobs’ demands. In addition, Sliter and Boyd (2014) stressed the need to consider the motivation for <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> when examining its possible effect on professional well-being. Individuals forced to hold multiple jobs due to financial reasons may, for instance, experience greater negative consequences than people who voluntarily choose to have multiple jobs.|$|E
30|$|First, {{the degree}} of {{variance}} explained by the models tested {{in this study is}} quite low. Thus, many other factors should be considered. On the basis of the previous literature, in future studies, we will particularly explore the additional contributions of part-time vs. full-time employment contracts and teachers’ motives for holding secondary jobs. Specifically, exposure to threatening factors and professional well-being could be reasonably influenced by the number of hours individuals spend in teaching, independently from whether or not they hold a second job. On the one hand, the high association we found between professional status (only teachers vs. multiple job-holders) and working-time percentage makes it hard to distinguish between the possible independent effects of the two variables on professional well-being. On the other hand, the fact that, independently from professional status, a low correlation was found between work-time percentage and perceived exposure to threatening factors and professional well-being, which supports us in considering a specific and independent effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> on professional well-being. However, more advanced investigations are needed to clarify the possible interaction between <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> and time spent in the different jobs with respect to professional well-being. Further analysis might also explore more in depth the contributions of gender, family status and teaching career phases.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first phase of}} a {{three-phase}} HFS major applied research activity that examines public and private interactions in health sectors of developing countries. A review of literature and experiences is conducted on payment systems, organizational frameworks, <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding,</b> and competition between sectors. The report outlines the proposed field and analysis work (Phases II and III) for the topic. To remedy government budget constraints in health care, an option for developing countries is to encourage the private sector to assume a greater role in financing and providing health services, increasing interactions between the public and private sectors. When considering this alternative, concepts such as sharing public resources with private providers and determining the division of service financing and provision by sector must be taken into account. Because many physicians in developing countries allocate their time between jobs held in both sectors, <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> is examined using behavioral equations for health personnel time allocations. This approach models how the two sectors are affected by the choices made. The review of literature on public-private interactions shows that such interactions are not well documented, although private sectors in general have the finances for large investments. Field data collection on public-private interactions is recommended in four countries: Egypt...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire of}} workers {{to engage in}} moonlighting, a {{phenomenon}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> {{is a reflection of}} some of the changing labour market outcomes. Public sector workers who suffered loss of jobs through public sector retrenchment and privatisation as part of Ghana’s economic reform resorted to holding more than one job to earn enough to avert any substantial drop in their living conditions. Despite the seemingly conspicuous existence of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> in Ghana, much remains to be learnt about its determinants and characteristics of the phenomenon. This article employs the probit regression estimation technique based on the two most recent nationwide household surveys conducted in 1998 / 99 and 2005 / 06 to investigate the main determinants of moonlighting in Ghana. It provides empirical evidence to suggest that personal and household characteristics as well as location and labour market characteristics such as individual earnings and hours spent in the main job significantly influence an individual’s desire to engage in more than one job. The study concludes that apart from the financial motive that drives an individual’s decision to moonlight, the engagement of moonlighting on account of lower working hours in the individual’s main job could be a symptom of visible or time-related underemployment...|$|E
30|$|The study {{reinforced}} the positive interpretation of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> {{as a possible}} resource for teachers at both the instructional and personal levels. The added value of this condition {{should be taken into}} greater consideration at the policy and school levels through the creation of favourable conditions for teachers who are interested in and available to experience additional jobs outside school walls. However, further investigation is needed to better understand the positive impact of combining teaching with another job, particularly in relation to specific jobs’ structural characteristics and individuals’ biographical situations.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the introduction of this paper, the previous literature has shown inconsistent findings concerning the possible risk or protective roles of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> on individuals’ job satisfaction and well-being (Guest et al. 2006). Some scholars (Parham and Gordon 2011; Arcuri et al. 1987; Maninger et al. 2011) have argued that multiple job-holders experience greater risks in terms of psychological well-being {{and that they are}} less engaged in their primary job than single job-holders are. In contrast, other studies have shown that multiple job-holders report lower burn-out and turnover intentions (Jamal et al. 1998). Finally, several researchers have found no differences between multiple job-holders and single job-holders with respect to professional satisfaction or well-being (Pearson et al. 1994; Guest et al. 2006). The {{results of the present study}} indicate that combining teaching with another job has a primarily indirect effect on professional well-being. In particular, no difference was found between multiple job-holders and single job-holders in terms of job satisfaction, work engagement or a sense of confidence in facing professional challenges. Additionally, only a slight difference was found with respect to the two groups’ senses of competence as a teacher. These findings support those authors (Jamal et al. 1998; Guest et al. 2006; Pearson et al. 1994) who disagree with the “deprivation-constrains hypothesis”, according to which being involved in multiple jobs negatively impacts individuals’ quality of work life. Moreover, teachers who combined teaching with other jobs reported less exposure to professional challenges and perceived these those challenges as less stressful. Although our data did not inform us of the degree of burn-out of the participants, we can assume that the lower stress related to perceived challenges will be associated with lower risk of burning out. Furthermore, the moderating effect of combining teaching with another job on the association between professional challenges and certain variables of job well-being offers further evidence of the protective (albeit indirect) role of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding.</b> In sum, our findings support a positive view of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding,</b> particularly with regard to its contribution to reducing perceived challenges and stress rather than to reinforcing professional well-being.|$|E
30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} were first applied {{to develop a}} general picture of the three investigated groups (i.e. only teachers, multiple job-holders in similar fields and multiple job-holders in heterogeneous fields) with respect to gender, teaching experience and age. In addition, the association between <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> and working-time percentage in teaching was considered. In Switzerland part-time contracts are highly diffused, and variegated working-time percentages for employees exist, ranging from 5 to 10  % to 100  %. In the Canton of Ticino, full-time VET teaching (100  % working-time percentage) implies about 40 working hours per week, including 25  h to be spent teaching in the classroom.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{ways in which}} the labour market behaviour of artists differs from the predictions of conventional theory. This paper considers one particular aspect of artists’ labour supply, i. e. the extent to which preferred time allocations to creative work can be realised, given the <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> and other characteristics of artists’ working arrangements. It is suggested that greater financial security and the accumulation of human capital are likely to be associated with increased ability to achieve equilibrium between desired and actual labour supply to the market for creative work.

In addition, artists often lack the career development training and skills necessary to succeed in portfolio or protean careers.

40|$|Participation {{rates for}} farm women in off-farm labor markets {{continue}} to increase, as does {{their participation in}} making major farm decisions such as whether {{to buy or sell}} land, adopt a new production practice or invest in farm equipment. Data from the Survey of U. S. Farm Women conducted in 2001 by Penn State in collaboration with researchers at the Economic Research Service and in collaboration with NASS are used to examine the multiple work roles of farm women off the farm and in farming. Descriptive statistics for the results of the 2001 survey are compared to those from the last major survey of U. S. farm women conducted by Rosenfeld in 1980. Then, using data limited to farm couples, models of job choice considering jointness in participation are estimated and tested under conditions of presence or absence of children, followed by estimation of models of on-farm decision-making using a household bargaining approach. Of particular interest is the effect of the >path= of intergenerational farm transfer (i. e., if inherited or purchased through her family or through her spouse=s/partner=s family) on job choice and farm decision-making. Results show that the work decisions of farm couples are correlated, both when children are present and when they are not. Further, the >path= of farm transfer influences the choices that women make. The transferof the farm through her family has in some cases a positive influence on her choices, both in terms of her involvement on the farm and her participation in farm decisions. Farm transfer through the husband=s/partner=s family generally has strong negative influences on her participation in farm decision-making.

30|$|Last, but not least, {{professional}} well-being {{should be}} better conceptualised and investigated. Although some scholars have demonstrated the validity of using single-item scales to analyse various components of well-being, including job satisfaction (Dolbier et al. 2005; Nagy 2002) and self-efficacy (Hoeppner et al. 2011), we aim to introduce standardised scales capable of more systematically exploring job satisfaction, work engagement {{and a sense of}} competence. In addition, collective well-being should be considered. Indeed, the literature has shown that combining teaching with another job might reduce teachers’ availability to participate in school meetings, as well as their availability to engage in additional school activities with colleagues (Maninger et al. 2011; Parham and Gordon 2011). Consequently, colleagues and principals might perceive <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> as a problem. This perspective should be considered in further studies.|$|E

30|$|Slightly {{significant}} associations {{were found}} between professional status and gender and teaching experience (see Additional file 1 : Tables S 6, S 7). Particularly, multiple job-holders were, in our sample predominantly male and beginning teachers. Moreover, people in the late phase of their careers {{were more likely to}} be only teachers—or, alternatively, to be involved in an additional job that is very different from the taught field. There was a high association between professional status and working-time percentage. As could have been expected, people who only teach were mostly employed with full time contracts. However, the sub-sample of multiple job-holders appeared to be more balanced in terms of working-time percentage (see Additional file 1 : Table S 8). People who combine teaching with another job were, in fact, equally distributed across the different working-time percentages. Finally, no associations {{were found between}} <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> and age (see Additional file 1 : Table S 9).|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the percentage of}} families involved in off-farm employment provided the intellectual fodder for a symposium on multiple jobholding among farm families held in May, 1988. Like other books that are the off-spring of conferences and symposia, the weaknesses of the symposium are replicated in the book unless the editors apply a heavy hand to ensure interrelatedness and quality of contributions. Unfortunately, evidence of this editorial hand is missing: the book is uneven and fails to demonstrate the interconnections between chapters. Yet, even with this caveat, there are several significant research/modeling contributions and review essays. The five sections, which contain the history and definition of, causes of, surveys of, labor supply of, and social policies of multiple job holding, are written for agricultural economists, and provide a current (up to 1988) overview of the theoretical and empirical work governing <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> by American Canadian farm families...|$|E
30|$|Second, {{although}} multiple job-holders {{were originally}} defined {{as people who}} combined primary full-time jobs with secondary part-time jobs for economic reasons—so-called moonlighters (Wilensky 1963)—recent surveys have shown a more heterogeneous picture. A growing number of multiple job-holders combine two or more part-time jobs (Guest et al. 2006) {{as a consequence of}} the widespread use of non-standard contracts in the current labour market. Moreover, in many cases, the choice to combine two or more jobs is driven by an individual preference for independence and a self-managed career, as in the case of portfolio workers who “contract their skills and knowledge to various individuals and organisations, in effect creating a ‘portfolio’ of work activity for themselves” (Fenwick 2006, p. 66). On the basis of those considerations, many scholars have argued the need for a better understanding of the different impacts that such a variety of <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> situations has on individuals’ attitudes and behaviours at work (Guest et al. 2006; Sliter and Boyd 2014; Zickar et al. 2004).|$|E

30|$|First, {{the rate}} of people who combine {{multiple}} jobs is progressively increasing in various European (Simic and Sethi 2002) and non-European countries (Kimmel and Smith Conway 2001; Sliter and Boyd 2014). Moreover, many such people are school teachers (Stinson 1997; Simic and Sethi 2002). In Switzerland, {{the rate of}} multiple job-holders is gradually growing, increasing from 4  % in 1994 to 7.4  % in 2009 (Bundesamt für Statistik 2010). The <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> condition is especially favoured among Swiss vocational education and training (VET) teachers, who are required to have prior careers in their specific teaching fields. To satisfy this requirement, most become teachers after spending several years as employers or tradesmen and some keep their previous jobs {{in addition to their}} teaching jobs (see also Hof et al. 2011). In addition, the Swiss VET system has a strong apprenticeship tradition, founded on a “dual” structure that combines theoretical classes at school with practical experience at the workplace. In such a context, simultaneous experience as both a teacher and a professional in the taught field may be encouraged and valued as an advantage. Against this background, the increasing use of multiple-job contracts has stimulated a growing interest in investigating the possible effects of such a condition for individuals and organisations (Sliter and Boyd 2014).|$|E

While this variation has commonly been related to the prevalent tax regimes {{and the degree of}} transparency in the legal and commercial system, the causality is far from obvious and other factors [...] such as the importance of non-monetary compensation or social benefits [...] seem to be important. This paper sets up a model of a formal and informal sector where <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding</b> is feasible. The informal sector can choose to employ part time labour or full time workers; the latter will be subject to payroll taxation. The informal sector in this model makes its decisions contingent on the behavior of the formal sector and parameters, such as tax rates and the probability of being caught evading taxes. The model allows us to retrieve the ratio of the types of employment in each sector and their associated levels. With the closed form, a set of simulations are run that indicate the effect of shocks to demand and/or financing of social benefits on labour allocation. The distribution of employment across full and part time employment is very sensitive to the scale of subsidy given to benefits, as well as the tax regime and incidence. ...|$|E
40|$|Background : Maternal {{labor force}} {{participation}} {{has increased dramatically}} over the last 40 years, yet surprisingly {{little is known about}} longitudinal patterns of maternal labor force participation in the years after a birth, or how these patterns vary by education. Objective : We document variation by maternal education in mothers' labor force participation (timing, intensity, non-standard work, <b>multiple</b> <b>job-holding)</b> over the first nine years after the birth of a child. Methods : We use the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N~ 3000) to predict longitudinal labor force participation in a recent longitudinal sample of mothers who gave birth in large US cities between 1998 and 2000. Families were followed until children were age 9, through 2010. Results : Labor force participation gradually increases in the years after birth for mothers with high school or less education, whereas for mothers with some college or more, participation increases between ages 1 and 3 and then remains mostly stable thereafter. Mothers with less than high school education have the highest rates of unemployment (actively seeking work), which remain high compared with all other education groups, whose unemployment declines over time. Compared with all other education groups, mothers with some college have the highest rates of labor force participation, but Contribution : Simple conceptualizations of labor force participation do not fully capture the dynamics of labor force attachment for mothers in terms of intensity, timing of entry, and type of work hours, as well as differences by maternal education...|$|E
