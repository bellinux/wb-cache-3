I am also {{very grateful}} to my major advisor Dr. Taye Kufa for his follow up, meticulous guidance, encouragement, and assistance in data analysis, review and comments on the manuscript. I would like to extend my special thanks to my co-advisor Dr. Mulugeta Taye, who always in touch with <b>me,</b> <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> my work, and helped me in shaping up the manuscript. This thesis would have not been complete with out their assistance. I extend my sincere thanks to Dr. Bizuayehu Tesfaye for shaping up my first draft proposal and invaluable input while writing the thesis manuscript. I am indebted to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Gedeo Zone Agriculture and Rural Development office for giving the chance to peruse my study. I am also very thankful to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI/IPMS project) particularly the capacity-strengthening program for providing the financial support for the research and the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) for their permission {{to work on the}} experimental material used. I am also very grateful for Dr. Dirk Hoekstra, IPMS project manager, Dr. Azage, and Ketma Yilma for their willingness and support to under take the research. My colleague Aleminew Tagele and Abebe Assefa have special place in my heart for their goodwill cooperation and assistance from the beginning to the end of my study...|$|E

6000|$|Ali swung {{upon her}} in a rage. [...] "Did I not bid thee wait below, thou {{daughter}} of shame?" [...] he stormed. [...] "She has <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> my lord, to thrust herself in here upon you. Shall I drive her forth?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{dress was}} draggled, my hat had slipped back, and the kinks and curls of my obstreperous hair were {{something}} awful. I know I looked very disreputable and also, no doubt, very guilty and conscience-stricken. Aunt {{gave me an}} unutterable look and then <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to my room in grim silence.|$|R
5000|$|Black Box Recorder were an English indie rock group. They {{debuted in}} 1998 with England Made <b>Me</b> and <b>followed</b> this <b>up</b> with The Facts of Life, which gave them their first {{hit with the}} single {{of the same name}} in April 2000. Their third album, Passionoia, was {{released}} in 2003. There is also a compilation album, The Worst of Black Box Recorder, a collection of B-sides, cover versions and remixes.|$|R

[...] This was speedily done. [...] "Now," [...] {{continued}} Jack, [...] "you'll just <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to my cabin; it's a pretty tough climb, but I'll want your help to bring down the runners." ...|$|R

The man is a scoundrel, who played Bob false, and won largely by that mare. And the girl has had the cheek to write to me," [...] said Mrs. Duncombe, warming into her old phraseology--"to me!--to thank me for {{opportunities}} of meeting, and to tell <b>me</b> she has <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> the teaching of last year." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{continuing}} the series past Abyss, Palmieri said, [...] "My boss at that time, associate publisher Scott Shannon, urged <b>me</b> to <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> with more Section 31 books right away. I resisted {{the idea for}} several reasons. I hated the thought of beating a story concept into the groundâ€”I hated it then, and I hate it now. I also think Section 31, like the Borg, works best when used sparingly, and only when the right story presents itself. Lastly, I wanted to develop other Star Trek story concepts. I'm glad the miniseries was popular, but I'd much rather {{go on to the}} next cool idea than repeat myself so soon. I think that's one of the key ways to keep the Star Trek fiction line fresh and interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Putney, {{putting his}} {{leg over the}} back of a chair into its seat, for his greater ease in conversation, [...] "I could, if I were a lawyer in a novel. But what do you think I can do with two women like these, who <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> every inch of the way, and want to know just what I mean by every step I take? You're acquainted with Miss Suzette, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I dashed aft myself {{meeting on}} my way a hard gust of wind whose {{approach}} Gambril's ear had detected from afar and which filled the sails on the main {{in a series of}} muffled reports mingled with the low plaint of the spars. I was just in time to seize the wheel while Frenchy who had <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> caught <b>up</b> the collapsing Gambril. He hauled him out of the way, admonished him to lie still where he was, and then stepped up to relieve me, asking calmly: ...|$|R
6000|$|The women, at this, {{raised a}} squeal {{that might have}} been heard in Holkar's camp, and fainted in {{different}} directions; but my dear Belinda whispered in my ear, [...] "Well done, thou noble knight! bravely said, my heart's Goliah!" [...] I felt I was right: I could have blown her up twenty times for the luxury of that single moment! [...] "And now, ladies," [...] said I, [...] "I must leave you. The two chaplains will remain with you to administer professional consolation--the other gentlemen will <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> stairs to the ramparts, where I shall find plenty of work for them." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began the}} climb. But {{they did not}} wait. One by one they unlashed {{themselves}} and <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> the perilous mast. There was reason for haste, for at any moment the Sparwehr might slip off into deep water. I timed my leap, and made it, landing in the cleft in a scramble and ready {{to lend a hand}} to those who leaped after. It was slow work. We were wet and half freezing in the wind-drive. Besides, the leaps had to be timed to the roll of the hull and the sway of the mast.|$|R
5000|$|... "a Roman {{inscription}} whose existence {{had escaped}} {{the notice of}} the archaeologists who had preceded me, even as it has that {{of those who have}} <b>followed</b> <b>me,</b> for <b>up</b> to the present day no one, as far as I know, has noticed it or mentioned it. It is not graffito, but a large inscription carved in lapidary style in a cartouche with triangular tabs at the ends, engraved on the back wall of the ante-chamber, above the low door, about two metres above the floor of the chamber." ...|$|R
60|$|We alighted {{at one of}} {{the entrances}} to the Square she had mentioned, where I {{directed}} the coach to wait, not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it. She laid her hand on my arm, and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets, of which there are several in that part, where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families, but have, and had, long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms. Entering at the open door of one of these, and releasing my arm, she beckoned <b>me</b> to <b>follow</b> her <b>up</b> the common staircase, which was like a tributary channel to the street.|$|R
60|$|This {{was acting}} with some prudence, and I {{went to work}} with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it, I {{tethered}} the three kids in {{the best part of}} it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand: so that after my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they would <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> and down, bleating after me for a handful of corn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Miss Tita, [...] "they {{were never}} nice till now!" [...] There was an unmistakable {{reference}} {{in this and}} a flattering comparison, so {{that it seemed to}} me I had gained a small advantage. As it would help <b>me</b> to <b>follow</b> it <b>up</b> to establish a sort of grievance I asked her why, since she thought my garden nice, she had never thanked me in any way for the flowers I had been sending up in such quantities for the previous three weeks. I had not been discouraged--there had been, as she would have observed, a daily armful; but I had been brought up in the common forms and a word of recognition now and then would have touched me in the right place.|$|R
6000|$|... "A snare! a snare!" [...] cried Wulf, {{drawing his}} sword. [...] "Swift! <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> the Bradwell path!" [...] and he struck the spurs into his horse. It bounded forward, {{to be dragged}} next second with all {{the weight of his}} {{powerful}} arm almost to its haunches. [...] "God's mercy!" [...] he cried, [...] "there are more of them!" [...] And more there were, for another band of men armed and linen-hooded like the first, had leapt down on to that Bradwell path, amongst them a stout man, who seemed to be unarmed, except for a long, crooked knife at his girdle and a coat of ringed mail, which showed through the opening of his loose tunic.|$|R
60|$|The closer he <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> {{the more}} did I {{perceive}} that Lady Georgina threw out acrid hints with increasing spleen {{about the ways}} of adventuresses. They were hints of that acrimonious generalised kind, too, which one cannot answer back without seeming {{to admit that the}} cap has fitted. It was atrocious how middle-class young women nowadays ran after young men of birth and fortune. A girl would stoop to anything in order to catch five hundred thousand. Guileless youths should be thrown among their natural equals. It was a mistake to let them see too much of people of a lower rank who consider themselves good-looking. And the clever ones were the worst: they pretended to go in for intellectual companionship.|$|R
60|$|As I {{rose in the}} air the lava, now belching {{forth with}} renewed vigour, <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> fast <b>up</b> {{the mouth of the}} crater. It <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> fast, like a living creature. One might almost have fancied that PÃ©lÃ©, {{disappointed}} of her victim, made haste in her frantic efforts to snatch him from the hands of that frail mortal maiden who strove almost in vain to rescue him in time by violent means from her cruel clutches. I didn't wonder any longer that those ignorant and superstitious natives should picture the volcano to themselves in their own souls as a living will. I almost felt it alive myself, so wildly and eagerly did the tongues of flame seem to dart forth towards me with their forked and vibrating tips, as if thirsting to lick me up and swallow me down in their hungry lunges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't," [...] said Miss Miniver, gesticulating triumphantly with her thin hand and thinner wrist, and patting Ann Veronica's knee. [...] "Of course you don't. That's {{the wonder of}} it. But you will, you will. You must {{let me take you}} to things--to {{meetings}} and things, to conferences and talks. Then you will begin to see. You will begin to see it all opening out. I am up to the ears in it all--every moment I can spare. I throw up work--everything! I just teach in one school, one good school, three days a week. All the rest--Movements! I can live now on fourpence a day. Think how free that leaves <b>me</b> to <b>follow</b> things <b>up!</b> I must take you everywhere. I must take you to the Suffrage people, and the Tolstoyans, and the Fabians." ...|$|R
50|$|The town is {{recalled}} {{in the famous}} Irish folk song, <b>Follow</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> to Carlow, written in the 19th century about the Battle of Glenmalure, part of the Desmond Rebellions of the late 16th century. In 1650, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Carlow was besieged and taken by English Parliamentarian forces, hastening {{the end of the}} Siege of Waterford and the capitulation of that city. During the 1798 rebellion Carlow was the scene of a massacre of 600 rebels and civilians following an unsuccessful attack on the town by the United Irishmen, known as the Battle of Carlow. The Liberty Tree sculpture in Carlow, designed by John Behan, commemorates the events of 1798. The rebels slain in Carlow town are buried in the 'Croppies Grave', in '98 Street, Graiguecullen.|$|R
6000|$|... "'"On the 16th my wife {{gave me a}} cheque for {{the amount}} and I cashed it at her bank--Bird's in Fleet Street. At half-past nine the {{following}} morning I was at the appointed place. An individual wearing a grey overcoat, bowler hat, and red tie accosted me by name and requested me to walk {{as far as his}} lodgings in the King's Parade. I followed him. Neither of us spoke. He stopped at a house which bore the name 'Russell House,' and which I shall be able to swear to as soon as I am able to go out. He let himself in with a latch-key, and asked <b>me</b> to <b>follow</b> him <b>up</b> to his room on the third floor. I thought I noticed {{when we were in the}} room that he locked the door; however, I had nothing of any value about me except the Â£10,000, which I was ready to give him. We had not exchanged the slightest word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps so, Cousin, {{but where}} is the need? To be frank, things have not gone over well with me when we stood face to face before, and it is odd, but do you know, I have been troubled with a foreboding {{that you would be}} the end of me. That is one of the reasons why I sought a change of air to these warmer regions. But see the folly of forebodings, my friend. I am still alive, though I have been ill, and I mean to go on living, but you are--forgive me for {{mentioning}} it--you are already dead. Indeed those gentlemen,' and he pointed to the two black men who were taking advantage of our talk to throw into the sea the slave who <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> the hatchway, 'are waiting to put a stop to our conversation. Have you any message that I can deliver for you? If so, out with it, for time is short and that hold must be cleared by daybreak.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The man slunk away. I {{suppose he}} {{realized}} that {{with me in the}} way their game was up. But afterwards he must have hesitated, and then made up his mind to attempt what was probably the bravest action of his life. He <b>followed</b> <b>me,</b> stole <b>up</b> softly behind, and with an old trick which they teach them {{on the other side of}} the Seine, he as nearly as possible throttled me. However, I got my finger inside the slipknot, and I held him by the throat. When I could breathe, I lifted him up and threw him into the marshes. There I left him. It seems the fall killed him. That is the whole story. It was absolutely God's justice, but I am quite aware that the laws of the country do not exactly favour such summary treatment. Accordingly I held my peace. I am sorry for it now." ...|$|R
