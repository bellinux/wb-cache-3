5|$|Like most spiders, Zygoballus sexpunctatus is an {{opportunistic}} feeder, {{feeding on}} a wide range of invertebrate prey. The spider's diet typically includes small insects such as aphids and young caterpillars. They have also been known to eat <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> numerous kinds of small spiders.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to <b>mosquitoes,</b> <b>and</b> most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|In response, German {{submarines}} flowed {{out of the}} Baltic to Norway {{through the}} mined coastal waters, close to the Swedish coast. Coastal Command's No. 16 Group and No. 18 Group RAF had success against these submarines in April and May 1945. German crews travelled on the surface, for fear of mines, exposing them to air attack. <b>Mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> Beaufighters from the two groups sunk several vessels. The last kill took place on 7 May 1945, when Flight Lieutenant K. Murray, flying a No. 210 Squadron RAF Catalina, crippled U-320. The submarine foundered two days later with all hands.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught Plasmodium falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, {{there is some evidence}} that low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild chimpanzees.|$|E

Rock, can utilise multiple tools such as ladders, shovels, armour, and explosives, {{which can be used}} to explore and discover new areas. Monsters such as moles, <b>mosquitoes,</b> <b>and</b> dragons seek to kill the player-character. Digger's only defence is his shovel, which can be used to attack enemies as well as mining stone. The player starts the game with three lives.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the autumn}} of 1941, U-boats began {{operating}} further into the Atlantic. Coastal Command's requirement programme was 150 Catalinas and 76 Sunderlands for 26 flying-boat units; 32 Liberators and 32 Wellingtons or Whitleys to equip four long-range GR squadrons; 64 <b>Mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> 180 GR Hudsons for 15 medium to long-range units; 128 Beauforts for eight torpedo-bomber squadrons; and 160 Beaufighters for 10 long-range fighter squadrons. However, four flying-boats and two GR short-range squadrons were {{to be sent to}} West Africa, and another three flying-boat squadrons were for Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. <b>Mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
5|$|On August23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{deployed}} 717 personnel, {{mainly from}} the disaster response team, to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water, causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks. By August25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home. On August26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Welter's claims for success in nocturnal aerial combat with the Me 262 stems from a memorandum written by Welter on 29 May 1945 for his British captors. In this memorandum Welter stated that between December 1944 {{and the end of}} January 1945, as the sole pilot of Kommando Welter, he flew seven Me 262 sorties and achieved three victories against Mosquito aircraft and two victories against Lancaster aircraft. Welter further stated that from the formation of 10./NJG11 on 28 January 1945 {{to the end of the}} war, 10./NJG11 flew around another 63 operational sorties and claimed a further 38 victories against Mosquito aircraft at night and five victories against Mosquito aircraft by day; his share being 20 Mosquitos at night and two during the day. Thus, according to the memo, a total of 25 <b>Mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> two Lancasters were claimed in aerial combat by Welter, flying the Me 262 with the Kommando/Staffel, while other pilots of the Staffel claimed a further 21 kills (of which three were achieved with the two-seater Me 262). Official Luftwaffe documents show that by 4 April 1945, 10./NJG11 had claimed 34 aerial victories, of which only one was claimed in a two-seater Me262. Research of RAF records show that at most 15 Mosquitoes could have been possibly destroyed by Kommando Welter—10./NJG11.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of yellow fever. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of <b>mosquitoes</b> <b>and</b> water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
