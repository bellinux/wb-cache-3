5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After <b>malting,</b> <b>barley</b> is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E

50|$|Grain whisky ordinarily {{refers to}} any whisky made, {{at least in}} part, from grains other than <b>malted</b> <b>barley,</b> such as whisky made using maize (corn), wheat or rye. Grain whiskies may also contain some <b>malted</b> <b>barley</b> (and are {{required}} to if produced in Ireland or Scotland.) Whisky made from only <b>malted</b> <b>barley</b> is generally called malt whisky rather than grain whisky. Most American and Canadian whiskies are grain whiskies.|$|R

2500|$|... 'Larker', a six-rowed, semi-smooth-awn <b>malting</b> <b>barley,</b> {{was first}} {{released}} in 1961. It was medium-maturity with moderate straw strength and medium height. 'Larker' was rust-resistant, but susceptible to leaf diseases and loose smut. It {{was superior to}} all other malt varieties for kernel plumpness {{at the time of}} release.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Foster', a six-row, white-aleurone <b>malting</b> <b>barley,</b> was {{released}} by NDSU in 1995. About one day earlier and slightly shorter than 'Robust', it is higher-yielding than 'Morex', 'Robust', and 'Hazen'. Straw strength is similar to 'Excel' and 'Stander', but better than 'Robust'. It is moderately susceptible to net blotch, but resistant to spot blotch. Protein is 1.5% lower than 'Robust' and 'Morex'.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Excel', a six-row, white-aleurone <b>malting</b> <b>barley,</b> was {{released}} by Minnesota in 1990. Shorter in height than other six-row barleys grown at that time, it is high-yielding with medium-early maturity, moderately strong straw, smooth awns, and long rachilla hairs. It has high resistance to stem rust and moderate resistance to spot blotch, but is susceptible to loose smut. Malting traits are equal or greater than 'Morex' with plum kernel percentage lower than 'Robust'.|$|E

2500|$|Scientists aim to {{discover}} what goes on inside barley grains as they become malted to help plant breeders produce better <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> for food and beverage products. The United States Agricultural Research Service scientists are interested in specialized enzymes called serine-class proteases that digest beta-amylases, which convert carbohydrates into [...] "simple sugars" [...] during the sprouting process. The enzyme also breaks down stored proteins into their amino acid derivatives. The balance of proteins and carbohydrates broken down by the enzyme affect the malt’s flavor.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Drummond', a six-row malting variety, was {{released}} by NDSU in 2000. It has white aleurone, long rachilla hairs and semismooth awns. 'Drummond' has better straw strength than current six-row varieties. Heading date is similar to Robust and plant height is similar to Stander. It is resistant to spot blotch and moderately susceptible to net blotch. However, its net blotch resistance is better than any current variety. Fusarium head blight reaction {{is similar to that}} of 'Robust'. It is resistant to prevalent races of wheat stem rust, but is susceptible to pathotype Pgt-QCC. 'Drummond' is on the American <b>Malting</b> <b>Barley</b> Association's list of recommended varieties. In two years of plant-scale evaluation, 'Drummond' was found satisfactory by Anheuser-Busch, Inc. and Miller Brewing.|$|E
2500|$|Garrett's grandfather, {{owner of}} the family {{engineering}} works, Richard Garrett & Sons, had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett's uncle. Despite his lack of capital, Newson {{was determined to be}} successful and in 1841, at the age of 29, he moved [...] his family [...] to Suffolk, where he bought a barley and coal merchants business in Snape, constructing Snape Maltings, a fine range of buildings for <b>malting</b> <b>barley.</b> The Garretts lived in a square Georgian house opposite the church in Aldeburgh until 1852. Newson's malting business expanded and seven more children were born, Edmund (c. 1841), Alice (1842), Agnes (c. 1846), Millicent (1847), Samuel (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh.|$|E

2500|$|The Garrett {{ancestors}} had been ironworkers in East Suffolk {{since the early}} seventeenth century. Newson {{was the youngest of}} three sons and not academically inclined, although he possessed the family’s entrepreneurial spirit. When he finished school, the town of Leiston offered little to Newson, so he left for London to make his fortune. There, he fell [...] in love with his brother's sister-in-law, Louisa Dunnell, the daughter of an innkeeper of Suffolk origin. After their wedding, the couple went to live in a pawnbroker's shop at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel. The Garretts had their first three children in quick succession: Louie, Elizabeth and their brother (Dunnell Newson) who {{died at the age of}} six months. While Louisa grieved the loss of her third child, it was not easy to raise their two daughters in the city of London at that time. When Garrett was 3 years old, the family moved to 142 Long Acre, where they were to live for 2 years, whilst one more child was born and her father moved up in the world, becoming not only the manager of a larger pawnbroker's shop, but also a silversmith. Garrett's grandfather, owner of the family engineering works, Richard Garrett & Sons, had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett's uncle.

40|$|Information {{is needed}} {{on the effects of}} {{management}} practices on dryland <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgaris L.) and pea (Pisum sativumL.) yields and quality. We evaluated the effects of tillage and cropping sequence combination and N fertilization on dryland <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> and pea yields, grain characteristics, N uptake, and N use-efficiency from 2006 to 2011 in eastern Montana. Treatments were no-tilled continuous <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> (NTCB), no-tilled <b>malt</b> barley-pea (NTB-P), no-tilled malt barley-fallow (NTB-F), and conventional-tilled malt barley-fallow (CTB-F), each with 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha- 1. As N rates increased, <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> grain yield, protein concentration, and N uptake increased in NTB-F, NTB-P, and NTCB, but test weight, plumpness, and N-use efficiency decreased in all tillage and cropping sequence combinations. Similarly, plant stand, biomass (stems and leaves) yield, and N uptake increased with increased N rates. Grain and biomass yields, N uptake, and N-use efficiency were greater in CTB-F than in NTB-P and NTCB but tillage had no effect on these parameters. <b>Malt</b> <b>barley</b> and pea yields and N uptake varied with cropping sequences and N rates among years. Although grain yield increased with increased N rates, NTB-P with N rates between 40 to 80 kg N ha- 1 may be used to sustain dryland <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> yield and quality (protein concentration 3 ̆c 135 g kg- 1, plumpness 3 ̆e 800 g kg- 1) in the northern Great Plains...|$|R
