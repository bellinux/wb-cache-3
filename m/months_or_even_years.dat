5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years,</b> while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is unknown}} what <b>month,</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>year,</b> of Leonora’s death {{but can be}} {{recorded}} around 1678. Leonora {{was one of three}} daughters of the Duarte family to die from Antwerp’s plagues. The year of her death is supported by city records of the event.|$|R
50|$|Ubuntu {{releases}} {{are made}} semiannually by Canonical Ltd, the developers of the Ubuntu operating system, using {{the year and}} month of the release as a version number. The first Ubuntu release, for example, was Ubuntu 4.10 and was released on 20 October 2004. Consequently, version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a different <b>month</b> (<b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>year)</b> to that planned, the version number will change accordingly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a new survey of firms that provide 401 (k) plans for their employees. Our results suggest that few 401 (k) plans replaced pre-existing defined benefit pension plans, although a substantial fraction replaced previous defined contribution thrift and profit sharing plans. Our survey results also provide new evidence on patterns of 401 (k) participation. We find significant persistence in firm-level participation rates {{from one year to}} the next, which supports the view that 401 (k) participants are not making marginal decisions of whether or not to contribute to the plan in a given <b>month,</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>year,</b> but rather make long-term commitments to participate in these plans. ...|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{storage and}} {{acquisition}} of sufficient numbers of study samples mighttake <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> many <b>years</b> to complete [18, 19]. For these reasons sustainable sample processing and its qualityassurance over time is mandatory. In this way we will ensure {{high quality of}} thepatient material {{that will make the}} comparative MM studies possible.|$|R

It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far Athos, Greece - the center of Orthodox monastic life - in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{polyneuropathy}} {{usually has}} a gradual onset over <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> although axonal degeneration often begins before an individual experiences any symptoms. An early warning sign (prodrome) {{of the possibility}} of developing alcoholic polyneuropathy, specially in a chronic alcoholic, would be weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead {{to the development of the}} disease.|$|E
25|$|If untreated, the {{bacteria}} may {{persist in the}} body for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years,</b> despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement, and hiding in the extracellular matrix, which may interfere with the function of immune factors.|$|E

50|$|However, in practice, some {{consulates}} {{require an}} appointment to be made prior to the applicant being able to provide documents {{to apply for the}} passport, in some cases, appointments can only be available many <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> possibly <b>years</b> into the future, effectively undoing the upper limit for a timely issuance of the travel document.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of an Ezeogo, {{announcement}} of the obituary is delayed until reparations for an elaborate funeral are concluded and this may take up to a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> a <b>year</b> as in {{the case of}} Ezeogo Onu Chima, Eze Edda XVI. Burial takes place at night and only the royal family knows exactly which of the two graves dug the corpse is laid in.|$|R
25|$|The delay between {{consumption}} of a contaminated food and {{appearance of the}} first symptoms of illness is called the incubation period. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years,</b> {{such as in the}} case of listeriosis or bovine spongiform encephalopathy), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Oil spills {{penetrate}} {{into the}} structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> to clean up.|$|E
25|$|These {{spots are}} often {{followed}} {{within a few}} days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs the vision. In extreme cases, a person may only be able to tell light from dark in that eye. It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep.|$|E

25|$|Most smokers, when {{denied access}} to nicotine, exhibit {{symptoms}} such as irritability, jitteriness, dry mouth, and rapid heart beat. The onset of these symptoms is very fast, nicotine's half-life being only 2 hours.. The psychological dependence may linger for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> many <b>years.</b> Unlike some recreational drugs, nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's motor skills, judgement, or language abilities while {{under the influence of}} the drug.

25|$|When {{there is}} distant metastasis, the cancer is {{generally}} considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver {{are associated with a}} worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} was {{undertaken}} {{with the utmost}} secrecy, {{as much for the}} public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. <b>Months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.|$|E
25|$|In some {{decorative}} applications, {{wood with}} knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is painted, such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins {{present in the}} timber may continue to 'bleed' through {{to the surface of}} a knot for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot primer paint or solution (knotting), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem {{but it is difficult to}} control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.|$|E
50|$|Although {{other forms}} of the disease occur at younger ages, some {{individuals}} start having long term symptoms at thirty years of age. This disease also affects adolescents and young adults. This also affects the immune system which therefore results in rashes. The symptoms rarely affect the face or scalp, but occurs at other sites of the body. The duration may last for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> several <b>years.</b> For instance, new crops of lesions appear every few weeks.|$|R

40|$|An ELISA for IgA {{toxoplasma}} antibodies {{was positive}} in 12 pregnant women who serocon-verted during gestation. Positive IgA titers were also noted in 10 individuals with biopsy-proven toxoplasmic lymphadenitis; the highest titers were {{noted in the}} first months following onset of clinical signs. Toxoplasma IgA antibodies were also demonstrable in 8 of 9 infants/fetuses with congenital toxoplasma infection. In some, IgM antibodies could not be demonstrated. Among 20 patients with AIDS and biopsy-proven toxoplasmic encephalitis, only 1 had IgA antibodies. Noneof 20 individuals with chronic toxoplasma infectionhad demonstrable IgA antibodies. Demon-stration of IgA toxoplasma antibodies should be useful for diagnosis of recently acquired infec-tion and for diagnosis of the infection in the fetus and newborn. Interpretation of currently available serologic methods for the definitive diagnosis of early acute infection with Toxo-plasma gondii in adults {{is complicated by the}} prevalence of high IgG Toxoplasma antibody titers among normal individ-uals in most populations [1] and the fact that IgM antibodies may, in some individuals, persist for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>year...</b>|$|R
25|$|The series utilises {{time-lapse}} sequences {{extensively in}} order to grant insights {{that would otherwise be}} almost impossible. Plants live on a different time scale, and even though their life is highly complex and often surprising, most of it is invisible to humans unless events that happen over <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> are shown within seconds. Like many traditional wildlife documentaries, it makes use of almost no computer animation. The series also discusses fungi, although as it is pointed out, these do not belong to the kingdom of plants.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapy and}} other creative, {{humanistic}} intervention strategies are becoming popular methods {{for working with}} life-threatened patient and for working with the family members of patients who die—particularly bereaved children. Art therapy stimulates the conscious and unconscious expression of the mourning process in adult and child patients. Children are at greater psychological risk because their grief is less overt and can occur <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> after the death. Group therapy is used to provide social sanction {{for the expression of}} that grief and to promote adaptive mourning responses.|$|E
25|$|Most come {{to medical}} {{attention}} between 2 weeks and 3 months of age, when {{after a period}} of poor weight gain and vomiting, they were found to be dehydrated, with severe hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis ("Addisonian or adrenal crisis"). Renin but not aldosterone is elevated. Many infants born with this condition died before a method for diagnosis was recognized for proper treatment to begin. In some cases, the condition is more mild with signs and symptoms of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency appearing after <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>years</b> (late onset).|$|E
5000|$|Postpartum {{depression}} usually begins {{between two}} weeks to a month after delivery. Recent {{studies have shown that}} fifty percent of postpartum depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Therefore, in the DSM-5, postpartum depression is diagnosed under [...] "depressive disorder with peripartum onset", in which [...] "peripartum onset" [...] is defined as anytime either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. PPD may last several <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> a <b>year.</b> Postpartum depression can also occur in women who have suffered a miscarriage.|$|R
50|$|The {{promoters}} {{sought a}} title sponsorship deal, worth $5 million. However, the late {{announcement of the}} race meant {{that it was too}} late for most major potential advertisers to budget the funds necessary. Most corporate advertisers would ordinarily allocate their advertising budget <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> a <b>year</b> ahead of time. No major sponsor, even those already involved with the sport, stepped up to the event. The only sponsors that did sign on were mostly local advertisers, which collectively amounted to nowhere near the $5 million sought by organizers.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a {{position}} as visiting scholar is {{for a couple of}} <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> a <b>year,</b> though it can be extended. It is not unusual that host institutions provide accommodation for the visiting scholar. Typically, a visiting scholar is invited by the host institution. Being invited as a visiting scholar is often regarded as a significant accolade and recognition of the scholar's prominence in the field. Attracting prominent visiting scholars often allows the permanent faculty and graduate students to cooperate with prominent academics from other institutions, especially foreign ones.|$|R
