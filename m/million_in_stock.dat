The loss of WISH's CBS affiliation also affected the Media General-LIN merger, with the purchase price being lowered by $110 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock,</b> though no other factors were affected.|$|E

Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock {{would be available to}} the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.|$|E

25|$|Cattle plagues recurred {{throughout}} history, often accompanying {{wars and}} military campaigns. They hit Europe especially {{hard in the}} 18th century, with three long panzootics which, although varying in intensity and duration from region to region, {{took place in the}} periods of 1709–1720, 1742–1760, and 1768–1786. There was a major outbreak covering the whole of Britain in 1865/66. Later in history, an outbreak in the 1890s killed 80 to 90% of all cattle in southern Africa, {{as well as in the}} Horn of Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the epizootic. More recently, a rinderpest outbreak raged across much of Africa in 1982–1984, costing at least an estimated US$500 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> losses. The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated subsaharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness. Much of the land remains depopulated, under the control of the tsetse fly.|$|E
