40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the kinetics of the transesterification reaction is crucial to compare different routes or routes with different catalysts or reaction accelerators. The use of ultrasound is considereda method for accelerating the biodiesel production. However, little effort has been done and is {{reported in the literature}} about how and under what conditions the use of ultrasound really speeds up the process, or the conditions under which its use is unnecessary or even harmful, burdening the process. Two dissimilar energy injections into a typical route were tested: ultrasound (@ 1 MHz and no heating) and <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> (with heating), both applied in an 8 : 1 ratio of soybean oil and methanol, adding 1 % of KOH as catalyzer. As results, during the first 10 minutes of reaction ultrasound showed unbearable effect on the transesterification, whilst <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating achieved almost 70 % of conversion ratio. However, during the following 10 minutes, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating got nothing more than 80 % of conversion, a considerable less efficient process than ultrasound assisted one, which achieved more than 90 %. The straightforward explanation is that ultrasound continually inserts energy in a slower rate, what can result in a more stable conversion scenario. On the other hand, <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating provides more energy at a glance, but cannot push the final conversion rate beyond a limit, as the transesterification is a double-way chemical process. The instability <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating settles in the reaction medium pulls the components back to their original states more than pushes than to the converted equilibrium state of the matter...|$|R
