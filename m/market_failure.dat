5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of <b>market</b> <b>failure.</b> Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E

25|$|Markets where price {{negotiations}} meet equilibrium, but {{the equilibrium}} is not efficient {{are said to}} experience <b>market</b> <b>failure.</b> Market failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, non-perfectly competitive markets, principal–agent problems, externalities, or public goods. Among the major negative externalities which can occur as {{a side effect of}} production and market exchange, are air pollution (side-effect of manufacturing and logistics) and environmental degradation (side-effect of farming and urbanization).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the <b>failure</b> of <b>markets</b> and {{policies}} especially in the USA. This essay attempts to see the reasons of <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> caused by the policy failures and policy structures. It is important to remember that there are many ways of going around this issue and the current literature tends to take both sides of the issue very clearly. There is a group of academics who tend to believe that <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> cause policy failures and not vice versa. The other group tends to support what is the thesis of this paper that policy <b>failures</b> cause <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> The discussion of market efficiency and its policy implications is introduced as a start up point for <b>market</b> and non-market <b>failures.</b> The explanations provided by some authors on this issue is both, interesting and disturbing because the majority of economists believe that policy formulation and implementation has a significant role in policy <b>failure,</b> thereby causing <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> Most economists tend to ignore or confuse non-market <b>failures</b> with <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> and thereby blame the policies for all kinds of <b>failure</b> in the <b>market...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{theory of}} ignorance, by Lionel Robbins, {{focuses on the}} <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> as causes for lack of {{economic}} development. It describes the purpose of governments as the distribution of resources. As resources are scarce, the regime has to allocate those resources wisely to encourage economic growth. Therefore, lack of economic growth {{is caused by the}} inability to carry out correct decisions in allocating economic resources. For example, the previous president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, focused his policies only on developing the country's industries, {{which turned out to be}} disastrous to the economy. His successor, Kofi Abrefa Busia, knowing the mistakes of Nkrumah, still carried out the same expansionary economic policy, not because he did not know what policy was good or bad—because of ignorance—but because the institutional design in Ghana pushed him to do so. This example demonstrates that ignorance oversimplifies the situations and cannot offer a satisfactory explanation for why nations fail. First, this theory assumes that rulers are benevolent, and ignore the possibility that rulers intentionally carry out bad economic decisions for personal interests. Second, if a leader's ignorance is the cause, then by having a better and less ignorant leader, the country will witness greater economic growth. Yet, this isn't always the case.|$|E
50|$|However, he {{does say}} that {{although}} there are undoubtedly <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> in credit <b>markets,</b> and government does {{have a role in}} managing these <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> (and indeed supporting certain sectors), interest rate caps are ultimately an inefficient way of reaching the goal of lower long-term interest rates. This is because they address the symptom, not the cause of financial <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> In order to bring down rates sustainably, it is likely that governments will need to act more systemically, addressing issues in market information and market structure and on the demand side and ultimately supporting a deeper level of financial sector reform.|$|R

500|$|From a {{macroeconomic}} perspective, the PPF {{illustrates the}} production possibilities {{available to a}} nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis. [...] However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. <b>Market</b> <b>failure</b> (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) {{may lead to the}} wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.|$|E
500|$|While [...] "money surprise" [...] models floundered, efforts {{continued}} {{to develop a}} new classical model of the business cycle. A 1982 paper by Kydland and Prescott introduced real business cycle theory (RBC). Under this theory business cycles could be explained entirely by the supply side, and models represented the economy with systems at constant equilibrium. RBC dismissed the need to explain business cycles with price surprise, <b>market</b> <b>failure,</b> price stickiness, uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work. RBC rejected the idea of high involuntary unemployment in recessions and not only dismissed the idea that money could stabilize the economy but also the monetarist idea that money could destabilize it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Market {{equilibrium}} and <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> are two opposite concepts. Generally, {{power market}} {{is not able to}} work on the intersection of supply-demand curve because of the particularity of power network. It is the result of <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> That is to say, power market cannot work in equilibrium state. Nowadays, {{there are two ways to}} deal with <b>market</b> <b>failures,</b> such as coordination from government and coordination between participants. In this paper, the two methods are compared and one kind of coordination between participants is put forward to make power market work in equilibrium state.

40|$|The media {{landscape}} {{is subject to}} substantial technological change. In this Discussion Paper we analyse how technological trends affect the economic rationale for PSB. After identifying the aims and nature of PSB, we derive eight possible <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> from the specific economic characteristics of information. The changing relevance of these <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> is subsequently discussed {{in the light of}} the technological changes. Based on this analysis, we argue that public service broadcasting (PSB) for the digital age should be light in the sense that it has a much smaller mandate. The main reason for this conclusion is that, due to technological developments, many <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> in the broadcasting industry are no longer relevant. The broadcasting market thus functions more and more like a normal market. This implies that the allocation tends to the efficient outcome, as long as consumer valuation is properly accounted for. This is not the case when there are externalities and possibly not when it comes to valuing quality. In the presence of these <b>market</b> <b>failures,</b> an efficient allocation is not warranted in the broadcasting industry. It is these remaining <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> that give a future PSB a right to exist. JEL classification: D 60, H 41, L 82...|$|R

Payday lenders have no incentive to price their loans competitively since loans are not capable of being patented. Thus, if a lender chooses to innovate and reduce cost to borrowers in order to secure a larger share of the market the competing lenders will instantly do the same, negating the effect. For this reason, among others, all lenders in the payday marketplace charge at or very near the maximum fees and rates allowed by local law.|$|E
