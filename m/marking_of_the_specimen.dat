40|$|Abstract. A special speckle microinterferometer {{has been}} {{developed}} to test the mechanical properties of thin films electroplated on the single crystal silicon wafer. A piezo-actuated micro-loading unit is synchronized with the microinterfermeter to measure thin film deflection in bending with an accuracy of sub-micrometers. All of the film specimens were microfabricated to be the type of microbridge samples. They are made of Cu and NiFe, the sizes from 1102. 9 µm to 213. 7 µm long, 491. 0 µm to 9. 7 µm wide. The corresponding thicknesses are 9. 4 µm and 7. 6 µm, respectively. Deflections of the microbradge samples can be measured full-field and real-time by using the microinterferometer and no patterning or <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> surface is needed. The loading force is directly measured using a miniature load cell. The Young’s moduli are calculated for both material and sample size from the load-deflection curves. Test techniques, procedures and factors which affect on the deflection measurements are briefly presented along with detailed analyzes of the results...|$|E
50|$|Because {{the teeth}} are sharp and serrated, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species are presumed {{to have been}} carnivorous. How they captured, or even ate, their prey, along with their appearance, remains pure {{speculation}} until a more complete fossil, or skull, is found. One such theory as to how Edestus might have hunted and killed its prey was found by Wayne M. Itano <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Colorado et al. Itano examined specimens of Edestus minor from the Late Carboniferous deposits of Texas and discovered wear patterns that suggest that Edestus might have hunted by using its bizarre array of teeth to vertically thrash its prey, creating slashing wounds, thus incapacitating and then swallowing its prey. Such a method of predation would prove unique and as-yet-unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom if correct. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specimens</b> in Itano's study also suggest that Edestus might have preyed on tough-skinned animals, though what kind remains unknown.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{expression}} <b>of</b> activin A, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transforming growth factor-beta supergene family, was {{studied in}} various pulmonary conditions associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (3 cases with diffuse alveolar damage, 6 cases with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 1 case with pulmonary fibrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis) using immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded sections. Controls consisted of 10 cases with normal pulmonary parenchyma, and 2 cases with primary pulmonary hypertension and 1 case with secondary pulmonary hypertension were also studied. <b>The</b> lung <b>specimens</b> from normal parenchyma weakly expressed immunoreactive activin A on the bronchiolar epithelium.

40|$|The tensile properties, γ ←→ ε {{transformation}} and shape recovery have {{been related to}} <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> tensile axes i. e., along rolling direction(specimen 'A') and toward 45 ° to the rolling direction(specimen 'B') in a cold-rolled and then annealed Fe- 15 Mn- 10 Co- 5 Cr- 3 Si alloy.
