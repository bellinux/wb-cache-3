25|$|The {{driving force}} of {{moisture}} movement is chemical potential. However, {{it is not always}} easy to relate chemical potential in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey et al., 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based {{on the nature of the}} driving force, (e.g. pressure or <b>moisture</b> <b>gradient),</b> and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.|$|E
25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased <b>moisture</b> <b>gradient</b> in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or <b>moisture</b> <b>gradient.</b> It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the drying curves of 2 -inch thick Douglas-fir {{heartwood}} boards as predicted by a computer simulation by C. A. Hart (1983) with those actually observed in experimental kiln runs. The <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> within test boards were also simulated by the computer program and actually monitored by a thermo-moisture meter constructed by J. Forrer (1984). The measurements of <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> in single boards and across a stack of boards were made in a small experimental kiln and in an industrial kiln respectively using a common kiln schedule. In spite of correctable temperature effects on the monitored D. C. resistance values, Forrer's thermo-moisture meter performed well in the determination of moisture changes in different depths of test boards and in reflecting warm-up time and maximum <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients.</b> <b>Moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> in single boards or between boards in a stack, as predicted by the simulation program, came close to observed values. After adjustments of computer inputs, the simulated drying curves came into very good agreement with the actual drying curves. The same was true for <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> predicted by the simulation and monitored by the thermo-moisture meter. Thus, Hart's computer simulation originally developed for and verified on white oak lumber worked for the drying of Douglas-fir heartwood lumber as well. Both the simulation program and the thermo-moisture meter appear to be excellent tools for studying the drying behavior of wood...|$|R
40|$|Soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> along hillslopes in humid watersheds, {{although}} {{indicated by}} vegetation gradients and by studies using models, {{have been difficult}} to confirm empirically. While soil properties and topographic features are the two general physio-graphic factors controlling soil moisture on hillslopes, studies have shown conflicting results regarding which factor is more important. The relative importance of topographic and soil property controls was examined in an upland forested watershed at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachian mountains. Soil moisture was measured along a hillslope transect with a mesic-to-xeric forest vegetation gradient over a period spanning precipitation extremes. The hillslope was transect instrumented with a time domain reflectometry (TDR) network at two depths. Soil moisture was measured during a severe autumn drought and subsequent winter precipitation recharge. In the upper soil depth (0 - 30 cm), <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> persisted throughout the measurement period, and topography exerted dominant control. For the entire root zone (0 - 90 cm), soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> were found only during drought. Control on soil moisture was due to both topography and storage before drought. During and after recharge, variations in soil texture and horizon distribution exerted dominant control on soil moisture content in the root zone (0 - 90 cm). These results indicate that topographic factors assert more control over hillslope soil moisture during drier periods as drainage progresses, while variations in soil water storage properties are more important during wetter periods. Hillslope soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> in southern Appalachian watersheds appear to be restricted to upper soil layers, with deeper hillslope soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> occurring only with sufficient drought...|$|R

A state-of-the-art global model in a high-end computer framework is used to produce a 3 -member 73 -year ensemble run forced by observed SST to represent the Control run. The AEJ as produced by the Control is compared with the representation of the AEJ in the European Center for Medium Range Forecast Reanalyses (ERA- 40) and other observational data sets and found very realistic. Five Experiments are then performed, each represented by sets of 3 -member 22 year long (1980 - 2001) ensemble runs. The goal of the Experiments is to investigate the role of meridional soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients,</b> different land surface properties and orography. Unlike previous studies, which have suppressed soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> within a highly idealized framework (i. e., the so-called bucket model), terrestrial evaporation control is here achieved with a highly sophisticated landsurface treatment and with an extensively tested and complex methodology. The results show that the AEJ is suppressed by a combination of absence of meridional evaporation gradients over Africa and constant vegetation, even if the individual forcings taken separately do not lead to the AEJ disappearance, but only its modification. Moreover, the suppression of orography also leads to a different circulation {{in which there is no}} AEJ. This work suggests that it is not just soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients,</b> but a unique combination of geographical features present only in northern tropical Africa, which causes and maintains the jet...|$|R

50|$|Water {{migration}} {{influences the}} quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch {{as a result of}} starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a <b>moisture</b> <b>gradient</b> was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant. In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this <b>moisture</b> <b>gradient</b> induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture. The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products. As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.|$|E

Despite large gradients in θv, [ABA]root and root water potential was homogenous within the root zone. Consequently, unlike some split-root studies, root water uptake fraction from layers with different soil moisture did not influence xylem sap [ABA].

Currently, most analysis and design methods assume linear distribution of thermal and hygrothermal strains through the slab depth, which usually underestimates the critical tensile stresses in the concrete pavement. A micromechanical approach to calculate the moisture curling stresses in concrete pavements based on measured relative humidity gradients is proposed. In this approach, the loss in moisture from the cement microstructure creates a negative pressure in the concrete capillary pores, which ultimately produces the bulk concrete shrinkage and moisture curling (differential shrinkage). The hygrothermal strain at each point in the slab depth is calculated through the Kelvin-Laplace and Mackenzie equations, which provide a basis for calculating the moisture curling stresses at any time, similarly to the formulation for calculating temperature curling stresses.

Positive temperature gradients associated with the summertime distributions of solar radiation, SSTs, or clouds are not large enough to produce the easterly jet in the absence of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients.</b> A thermally direct ageostrophic circulation is identified that can accelerate the largely geostrophic zonal flow and maintain the jet. While moisture converges throughout the lower troposphere over East Africa, moisture divergence between 600 and 800 mb overlies low-level convergence over West Africa to the south of the African easterly jet. This moisture divergence is important for determining the total column moisture convergence. Since the moisture divergence is closely tied to the jet dynamics, and the jet’s magnitude and position are sensitive to SST and land surface conditions, a mechanism by which the West African precipitation field is sensitive to surface conditions is suggested. 1...|$|R

The interest of this approach is that it can be extended to calculate the emission and scattering of complicated multilayer media, including features such as volume effects, gradients effects and inclusions, as well as rough surfaces.

In contrast, xylem vessel traits (vessels diameter and density) did not vary producing loss of hydraulic conductivity at drier leeward edges. We also detected higher levels of phenotypic integration and variability at leeward edges. The ability of A. punctatum to modify leaf traits in response to differences in soil moisture availability established over short distances (< 500 m) facilitates its persistence in contrasting microhabitats within forest patches. However, xylem anatomy showed limited plasticity, which increases cavitation risk at leeward edges.

While there is increasing evidence that plant coexistence does depend upon niche differences, it is still not clear in most cases what the relevant niche axes are. We address this problem by testing for PNC within the African Restionaceae (‘restios’), a clade endemic to the Cape where we have shown niche segregation along soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> to be common. Significant niche segregation on soil <b>moisture</b> <b>gradients</b> occurred among restios in 7 of 10 communities sampled, but PNC was detectable in only one of these and then only by one of three methods used.

The demonstration that clear niche segregation may occur among related species without PNC being detectable supports the hypothesis that hydrological niche responses are evolutionarily labile. More generally, the results demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis can be a poor guide to the process of community assembly.
