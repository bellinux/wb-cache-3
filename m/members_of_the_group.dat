5|$|It is {{classified}} within the genus as within the Lanceolata group, {{which consists of}} 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed {{with each other in}} areas where two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> occur. P.terminalis has been reported to interbreed with Persoonia cornifolia and Persoonia sericea, two other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|The S. e. europaea {{group is}} found in Scandinavia and Russia, through to Japan and {{northern}} China. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> have a white breast.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

Another prominent <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> is <b>the</b> irregular galaxy NGC 55.|$|R

5|$|Chalciporus piperatus is {{a member}} of the genus Chalciporus, with which the genus Buchwaldoboletus form a group of fungi that is an early {{offshoot}} in the Boletaceae. Many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> appear to be parasitic.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Although their fossils are {{relatively}} rare and their group small in numbers, they lived across all continents except Australia and Antarctica for approximately 100 million years, from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> 12. The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.|$|E

5|$|The glee club instructor, Mr. Rad (Taran Killam), {{invites the}} study group to join and perform the Christmas pageant but is rebuffed {{promptly}} due to their collective dislike for the club.

5|$|To the {{surprise}} of the town, the surviving <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> returned to San Antonio on December 6.

5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff {{had set up}} a parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited claims by Uri Geller that he could make objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the group}} reunited, {{at the behest}} of RZA, for an album and tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of the albums release.

5|$|In a 1960 paper, American {{astronomer}} Olin J. Eggen {{concluded that}} Capella {{was a member}} of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing that <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> killed themselves {{because they believed}} the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they {{saw it as a}} way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
