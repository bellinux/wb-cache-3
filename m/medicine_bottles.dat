25|$|Christian Munch's {{military}} pay {{was very}} low, and {{his attempts to}} develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty. They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch's early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch's interests. At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired {{the work of the}} Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{opened a}} {{cupboard}} for the police: amongst <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> were [...] "chocolates – slabs stuck – butter, margarine, sugar". While the officers inspected it Adams walked to another cupboard and slipped two objects {{into his jacket}} pocket. Hannam and Pugh challenged him and Adams showed them two bottles of morphine; one he said was for Annie Sharpe, a patient and major witness who had died nine days earlier under his care; the other said [...] "Mr Soden". He had died on 17 September 1956 but pharmacy records later showed Soden had never been prescribed morphine. Adams was later (after his main trial in 1957) convicted of obstructing the search, concealing the bottles and for failing to keep a Dangerous Drugs register.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] Prescription <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> were found with labels identifying the following drugs: ampicillin, Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, pentazocine, and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues. [...] The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies. [...] The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after death.|$|E
5000|$|During the Dakota War of 1862, Shakopee III {{was a war}} {{leader of}} the Yankton Dakota in Minnesota. He escaped to Canada after the conflict. With fellow leader <b>Medicine</b> <b>Bottle,</b> he was betrayed, drugged, kidnapped, and turned over to U.S. forces. Shakopee and <b>Medicine</b> <b>Bottle</b> were {{executed}} at Fort Snelling on November 11, 1865 for {{their participation in the}} Dakota War. While he was held prisoner at Fort Snelling, Shakopee III was photographed in 1864.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Hardy, {{whistling}} softly, {{rose and}} walked round the room, uncorking <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> and sniffing at their contents. A smile of unaffected pleasure lit up his features as {{he removed the}} stopper from one particularly pungent mixture.|$|E
60|$|Again we {{proceeded}} {{to a third}} mortuary, if it may so be called, and here Maqueda pointed out the skeleton of a man, in front of which stood a tray piled up with what evidently had been the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> of the period and among them a number of rude surgical instruments.|$|E
60|$|He looked curiously {{round the}} room. It {{was not a}} bad bedroom, light and warm. There were many <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> {{aggregated}} {{in a corner of}} the washstand--and a bottle of Three Star brandy, half full. And there were also photographs of strange people on the chest of drawers. It was not a bad room.|$|E

60|$|Gerald nodded silently. They {{passed along}} the corridor. The {{door of the}} room which Mr. Dunster had {{occupied}} was ajar. As though by common consent, they both stopped and looked in. The windows were all wide open, the bed freshly made. The nurse was busy collecting some <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> and fragments of lint. She looked at them in surprise.|$|E

[...] "And you have been nursing me all the time?" [...] he whispered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper studied {{character}} recognition on <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> label containing batch number, production date and expiry date. It mainly consisted of character location, character segmentation and {{character recognition}}. Firstly, it preprocessed {{the image of}} <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> label for the following procedures; secondly, it obtained the general character region by contour tracing and realized the precise location by horizontal projection algorithm; then it located character adhesion region by vertical projection algorithm and segmented the merged characters by drop fall algorithm; finally, it adopted Karhunen-Loeve transform to extract character features from the subclasses of coarse classification and accurately recognized characters by the improved BP algorithm. Experiments show that the system can recognize the bottle label characters quickly and accurately, it is of great practical value.

As his friends rarely gave him brandy half as good when he dined out, it was his habit to take some of his own with him in his overcoat pocket in a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b> Then, when coffee was served, he asked the footman who was waiting on him to fetch his 'Medicine'." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Wickam, as {{a serious}} character, {{expressed}} her approval with a groan; and having made some cold dabs {{at the bottom of}} the bedclothes, as feeling for the patient's feet and expecting to find them stony; went clinking among the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> on the table, as who should say, 'while we are here, let us repeat the mixture as before.' ...|$|E
60|$|The nurse {{turned from}} the bed, however, {{attracted}} by the half-open door of the cupboard. Here were the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles.</b> She took them out one by one, looked at them with professional curiosity, pulled out the corks, smelt the contents, replaced the bottles. Then {{she went to the}} window, which stood open; she stepped out upon the stone steps which led into the garden, looking about her, to breathe the soft air of noon among the flowers.|$|E
60|$|With Barnacle junior, he {{signified}} {{his desire}} to confer; and found that young gentleman singeing the calves of his legs at the parental fire, and supporting his spine against the mantel-shelf. It was a comfortable room, handsomely furnished in the higher official manner; an presenting stately suggestions of the absent Barnacle, in the thick carpet, the leather-covered desk to sit at, the leather-covered desk to stand at, the formidable easy-chair and hearth-rug, the interposed screen, the torn-up papers, the dispatch-boxes with little labels sticking out of them, like <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> or dead game, the pervading smell of leather and mahogany, and a general bamboozling air of How not to do it.|$|E
5000|$|Much later (Scene II), Max {{is unable}} to wake Tito from his nap. Max finds an empty <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> and Maria's [...] "Dear John" [...] letter, which is written {{in such a way}} ("By the time you read this, I will be gone.") that Max mistakenly thinks Tito has {{committed}} suicide. When Saunders arrives, Max tearfully tells him that Tito is dead.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} concisely. He {{nodded to the}} {{paragraphs}} of my narrative {{and at the end}} he poured something from a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> into a sticky little wineglass and drank it. I became aware of the presence of drugs, of three or four small bottles before him among his disorder of papers, of a faint elusively familiar odour in the room.|$|R
2500|$|Improvised slides are common, {{including}} pipes, rings, spoons, {{and even}} stones. Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett {{was fond of}} using a Zippo lighter as a slide, but this was largely for special effects. [...] Glass bottles, such as beer bottles, are common, and Duane Allman (Derek and the Dominos, Allman Brothers Band) used a glass Coricidin <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b> Blues guitarist CeDell Davis used a butterknife.|$|R
60|$|On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly {{white face}} terrible upon the tumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little table {{beside the bed}} carried a few <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles,</b> some toast and water, and an empty glass. Every now and then the lank man's lips fell apart, to {{indicate}} a word he could not articulate. But the woman did not notice that he wanted anything, because she was busy turning out papers from an old-fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At first the picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter, so it became fainter {{and more and more}} transparent.|$|E
60|$|P.S. - Here I go again. To me, the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> on my chimney and {{the blood}} on my {{handkerchief}} are accidents; they do not colour my view of life, as you would know, I think, if you had experience of sickness; they do not exist in my prospect; I would as soon drag them under the eyes of my readers as I would mention a pimple I might chance to have (saving your presence) on my posteriors. What does it prove? what does it change? it has not hurt, it has not changed me in any essential part; and I should think myself a trifler and in bad taste if I introduced the world to these unimportant privacies.|$|E
60|$|Jacky had {{regularly}} constituted himself sick nurse {{to the old}} woman. Despite the entreaties of Flora and his sister, who feared that the disease might be infectious, {{he could not be}} prevailed on to remain away. His nursing did not, indeed, consist in doing much that was useful. He confined himself chiefly to playing on the river-banks near the hut, and to making occasional inquiries as to how the patient was getting on. Sometimes he also assisted Flora in holding sundry cups, and glasses, and <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles,</b> and when Flora was away he amused himself by playing practical jokes on the young woman who had volunteered to act as regular nurse to the old invalid.|$|E
50|$|In 1744 von Kleist {{tried to}} {{accumulate}} electricity {{in a small}} <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> filled with alcohol with a nail inserted in the cork.

He attempted to charge the bottle from a large prime conductor (invented by Bose) suspended above his friction machine.|$|R

6000|$|It was he {{who gave}} me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most of my ideas.

[...] And I would find a bright new lead tiger like a special creation at large in the world, and demanding a hunting expedition and much elaborate effort to get him safely housed in the city menagerie beside the captured dragon crocodile, tamed now, and his key lost and the heart and spring gone out of him.|$|E
60|$|For {{things are}} rather {{different}} {{when the man}} in the bed next looks at the bedroom. Not only is the rose-bush still very obvious; but the other things are looking very odd. The perspective seems to have gone crooked; the walls seem to vary in measurement till the man thinks he is going mad. The wall-paper has a new pattern, of strange spirals instead of round dots. The table seems to have moved by itself across the room and thrown the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> out of the window. The telephone has vanished from the wall; the mirror does not reflect what is in front of it. The portrait of himself over the mantelpiece has a face that is not his own.|$|E

The tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed's head, to exclude the wind, which, however, made {{its way into the}} comfortless room through the {{numerous}} chinks in the door, and blew it to and fro every instant. There was a low cinder fire in a rusty, unfixed grate; and an old three-cornered stained table, with some <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles,</b> a broken glass, and a few other domestic articles, was drawn out before it. A little child was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made for it on the floor, and the woman sat on a chair by its side. There were a couple of shelves, with a few plates and cups and saucers; and a pair of stage shoes and a couple of foils hung beneath them. With the exception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the room, these were the only things in the apartment.|$|E

60|$|Bailey thought {{swiftly and}} {{clutched}} a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> in either hand. One he flung, and it smashed against the acacia. Silently and deliberately, and keeping his bright {{eyes fixed on}} Bailey, the Malay clambered into the balcony. Bailey, still clutching his second bottle, but with a sickening, sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing and then the other.|$|R
50|$|Von Kleist {{wondered}} whether Bose's experiment at transmitting electricity through {{water to the}} flammable spirits would extend to capturing electricity in a small <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> filled with alcohol, since {{he knew that the}} glass of the bottle would act as an insulator and prevent the electricity from escaping. He therefore fitted his bottle with a cork through which protruded a nail in contact with the fluid to provide a point of entry.|$|R
