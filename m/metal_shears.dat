40|$|In {{the first}} Chapter, as a {{preliminary}} study phase, the seismic behaviour evaluation of existing RC buildings, with particular {{reference to the}} gravity-load designed ones, {{has been done by}} means of the analysis of appropriate seismic vulnerability assessment techniques. Then, once the fundamental lacks of such structures have been evidenced, a wide overview on the possible seismic protection systems, starting from conventional methodologies up to the introduction of innovative devices, has been presented. In the second Chapter a complete review of state-of-the-art on steel plate shear walls, with reference to both compact and slender shear panels, has been performed. In particular, for each panel typology, design criteria, theoretical and numerical modelling studies and experimental research activities have been illustrated in detail. Finally, some applications developed worldwide on such systems have been shown. In the third Chapter a wide numerical analysis on both compact and slender shear panels has been developed. Firstly, both parametric studies and numerical simulation of experimental tests on stiffened pure aluminium shear panels have been carried out. Then, in a second investigation phase, the behaviour of slender steel shear panels has been analysed by means of both refined and simplified numerical models and theoretical methods. In particular, a parametric analysis on such systems has been carried out by varying both the aspect ratio and the thickness of the plate and by evaluating the influence provided by intermediate stiffeners. Finally, the obtained results have provided useful information for the correct design of slender steel plates in shear. In the fourth Chapter the experimental campaign developed within the ILVA-IDEM research project, focusing the attention on the sub-structure devoted to the application of <b>metal</b> <b>shear</b> panels, has been presented. After the identification of the mechanical features of structure materials, the dynamic behaviour of the module under study, obtained under experimental way, has been numerically reproduced by means of the calibration of a finite element model. In conclusion, {{on the basis of a}} preliminary experimental cyclic test performed on the original RC structure, some pushover numerical analyses have been carried out in order to evaluate the building performance under lateral loads. In the fifth Chapter both the seismic retrofitting methodology and design of existing buildings by means of <b>metal</b> <b>shear</b> panels have been discussed and applied. Based on the provisions given by FEMA 273 and ATC- 40 American guidelines, the seismic performance of the building under investigation has been evaluated. Later on, a reliable procedure in the framework of the “performance based design” has been implemented aiming at improving its behaviour by means of the introduction of an appropriate shear panel configuration able to provide the strength and stiffness prerequisites requested for seismic retrofitting design of the original structure. In the sixth Chapter both numerical and experimental activities on the analysed RC structure equipped with <b>metal</b> <b>shear</b> panels have been illustrated. On the basis of the results deriving from seismic retrofitting design, both steel and pure aluminium shear panel configuration arrangements have been defined according to a simplified analytical procedure and then checked by adopting a sophisticated FEM model. Finally, after the global numerical analyses of the whole system, the full-scale test of the upgraded structure has been carried out and the achieved results have been interpreted, confirming the effectiveness of the adopted retrofitting devices. In the seventh Chapter the experimental test results have been compared each other and with the numerical analysis ones. Finally, interesting conclusions on the beneficial effects provided by <b>metal</b> <b>shear</b> panels for the seismic upgrading of existing RC buildings have been drawn...|$|R

40|$|Rapidly {{solidified}} alloys, {{based upon}} the Al-Fe-V-Si system and designed for elevated temperature applications, were evaluated for superplasticity and diffusion bonding behavior. Alloys with 8, 16, 27, and 36 volume percent silicide dispersoids were produced; dispersoid condition was varied by rolling at 300, 400, and 500 C (572, 752, and 932 F). Superplastic behavior was evaluated at strain rates from 1 x 10 (exp - 6) /s to 8. 5 /s at elevated temperatures.

Diffusion bonding was possible using low gas pressure at temperatures greater than 600 C (1112 F) which also resulted in degraded properties.

40|$|Steel plate shear walls (SPSWs) are {{innovative}} systems able {{to confer}} to either new or existing structures a significant capacity to resist earthquake and wind loads. Many tests {{have shown that}} these devices may exhibit high strength, initial stiffness and ductility, {{as well as an}} excellent ability to dissipate energy. When full SPSWs are used as bracing devices of buildings, they may induce excessive stresses in the surrounding main structure where they are inserted, so to require the adoption of large cross section profiles. For this reason, perforated steel panels, which are weakened by holes aiming at limiting the actions transmitted to the surrounding frame members, represent a valid alternative to full panels. In this work, aiming at showing the advantages of such devices, a FEM model of perforated panels has been calibrated on the basis of recent experimental tests. Subsequently, a parametric FEM analysis on different series of perforated panels, by changing the number and diameter of the holes, the plate thickness and the metal material, has been carried out. Finally, the achieved numerical results have been used to set up design charts to correctly estimate the strength and stiffness of perforated <b>metal</b> <b>shear</b> panels...|$|R
30|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical model}} of forces during shearing with angled tools {{was developed by}} Atkins (1990) in guillotining of copper plates. In that model, the force can be computed provided the materials shear yield stress, work hardening index, and fracture toughness in the plane of cut are known. The latter two parameters are, however, often not so readily available as the yield stress. Therefore, in this paper, a simple model is developed, {{based on the assumption}} of plane strain, in which the forces in shearing with angled tools are calculated from forces measured with parallel tools. The main purpose of this work is to compare the forces predicted by the model, with forces measured with inclined tools. Forces were accurately measured, both with parallel and angled tools, using an experimental set-up with a high stiffness and a stable tool clearance providing reliable reproducible results, as previously demonstrated by Gustafsson et al. (2014). If the model can predict the forces in shearing with angled tools, this implies that a 2 D plane strain FE analysis is applicable to obtain forces in shearing with angled tools. Furthermore, the presented experimental data {{can also be used to}} verify numerical models of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>shearing.</b>|$|R

40|$|Metal cutting is {{a process}} that uses tools to create new {{surfaces}} by imparting intense shear stresses and high strain rates on the work material. Consequently, the mechanical properties of the work material directly influence its machinability, and high strength materials such as titanium are notoriously difficult to cut. Laser assisted machining (LAM) is a promising solution to reduce the cutting pressures when machining difficult-to-cut materials. The method involves using a laser beam to locally heat and reduce the flow stress of the material ahead of an advancing cutting tool, making the <b>metal</b> <b>shearing</b> process easier. To date there is limited, if any, published literature on using the technology to improve the machinability of metastable beta-titanium alloys. It remains unclear whether these materials will respond to laser assisted machining since many are specifically designed to exhibit high temperature strength. This paper compares the conventional and laser assisted machining method for the high strength Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al beta-titanium alloy over a wide range of cutting parameters. The effect of the laser beam on the cutting force, cutting temperature and chip formation is discussed.
