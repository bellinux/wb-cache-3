5|$|Flanders's {{first major}} {{experience}} in <b>machine</b> <b>design</b> {{came when he}} helped an entrepreneur in Nashua, New Hampshire develop a box-folding machine. After that, {{he worked as a}} draftsman for General Electric until 1905, when he moved to New York City to work for Machine.|$|E

25|$|From the 16th century onwards, {{evidence}} of cranks and connecting rods integrated into <b>machine</b> <b>design</b> becomes {{abundant in the}} technological treatises of the period: Agostino Ramelli's The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines of 1588 alone depicts eighteen examples, a number which rises in the Theatrum Machinarum Novum by Georg Andreas Böckler to 45 different machines, {{one third of the}} total.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program, David Freeman {{announced}} the Open Hardware Specification Project (OHSpec), another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems. In early 1999, Sepehr Kiani, Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to <b>machine</b> <b>design</b> applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition. But most of these activities faded out after a few years.|$|E

2500|$|Although a major {{application}} of control theory {{is in control}} systems engineering, which deals with the design of process control systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this. [...] As {{the general theory of}} feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs. A few examples are in physiology, electronics, climate modeling, <b>machine</b> <b>design,</b> ecosystems, navigation, neural networks, predator–prey interaction, gene expression, and production theory.|$|E
2500|$|Rigid bodies ("links") {{connected}} by kinematic pairs ("joints") {{are known as}} kinematic chains. [...] Mechanisms and robots are examples of kinematic chains. [...] The degree of freedom of a kinematic chain is computed {{from the number of}} links and the number and type of joints using the mobility formula. [...] This formula {{can also be used to}} enumerate the topologies of kinematic chains that have a given degree of freedom, which is known as type synthesis in <b>machine</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{system has}} been criticised for {{usability}} issues in general system, website and top-up <b>machine</b> <b>design.</b> [...] The most significant usability issue is that customers who for whatever reason do not [...] "tag off" [...] {{at the end of}} their journeys will be charged a default fare - being charged [...] "equal to the cash fare on the assumed basis that a passenger who has failed to tag off has travelled to the final destination of that particular bus, train or ferry service". Users who have run up a debt of as little as $4 are prohibited from using the card until the debt is repaid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900 Kennedy {{was asked}} by The Admiralty {{to serve as a}} member of the Belleville Boiler Committee to {{investigate}} the installation of French designed Belleville boilers on Diadem class cruisers. This was the first in a long line of Admiralty commissions that he undertook which included work behind the front lines in France during the First World War. There followed several more admiralty appointments, serving on the <b>Machine</b> <b>Design</b> Committee from 1900 to 1906, the Ordnance Board in 1909 and on the government committee for wireless telegraphy in 1913. [...] During the First World War his skills were in great demand and he served on many committees including the Panel of the Munitions Inventions Department; as chairman of the Committee on Gunsights and Rangefinders; Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Ordnance and Ammunition and as Vice-Chairman of the Anti-Aircraft Sub-Committee. After the war he was employed by the Ministry of Transport as chairman of the Electric Railway Advisory Committee.|$|E
