6000|$|We {{travelled}} {{five hours}} in a North-Easterly course up a diagonal valley,[FN#18] through a country fantastic in its desolation-a mass of huge hills, barren plains, and desert vales. Even the sturdy Acacias here failed, and in some places the camel grass could not find earth enough for its root. The road wound among mountains, rocks and hills of granite, and over broken ground, flanked by huge blocks and boulders piled up as if man's art had aided Nature to disfigure herself. Vast clefts seamed like scars the hideous face of earth; here they widened into dark caves, there they were choked with glistening drift sand. Not a bird or a beast was to be seen or heard; their presence would have argued the vicinity of water; and, though my companions opined that Badawin were lurking among the rocks, I decided that these Badawin were the creatures of their fears. Above, a sky like polished blue steel, with a tremendous blaze of yellow light, glared upon us without the thinnest veil of <b>mist</b> <b>cloud.</b> Below, the brass-coloured circle scorched the face and dazzled the eyes, mocking them the while with offers of water that was but air. The distant prospect was more attractive than the near view, because it borrowed a bright azure tinge from the intervening atmosphere; but the jagged peaks and the perpendicular streaks of shadow down the flanks of the mountainous background ...|$|E

50|$|If {{water damage}} or water volume is of {{particular}} concern, a technique called Water Mist Fire Suppression may be an alternative. This technology has been under development for over 50 years. It hasn't entered general use, but is gaining some acceptance on ships {{and in a few}} residential applications. Mist suppression systems work by using the heat of the fire to 'flash' the water <b>mist</b> <b>cloud</b> to steam. This then smothers the fire. As such, mist systems tend to be highly effective where there {{is likely to be a}} free-burning hot fire. Where there is insufficient heat (as in a deep seated fire such as will be found in stored paper) no steam will be generated and the mist system will not extinguish the fire. Some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} water mists on premixed flame propagation has been conducted onboard the Space Shuttle {{to take advantage of the}} prolonged microgravity environment to study the effect of uniformly distributed clouds of polydisperse water mists on the speed and shape of propagating propane-air premixed flames. The suspension of a quiescent and uniform water <b>mist</b> <b>cloud</b> was confirmed during the microgravity tests. Preliminary results show good agreement with trends obtained by the numerical predictions of a computational model that uses a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation to simulate the two-phase, flame/mist interaction. Effective flame suppression is observed at progressively higher water loadings and smaller water droplet sizes. Other unusual flame behavior, such as flame front breakup and pulsating flames, is still under investigation. The promising results from the microgravity tests will be used to assess the feasibility of using water mists as fire suppressants on Earth and on spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the results obtained from the Water-Mist Fire Suppression experiment (Mist) that flew on the STS- 107 mission of the Space Shuttle is presented. The objective of Mist is to {{study the effects of}} droplet size distribution and water concentration on the burning velocity of a propagating premixed propane-air flame. Changes of the laminar flame speed and shape are used as the measure of flame suppression efficacy. Thirty-two tests were conducted with four different fuel-air equivalence ratios (0. 6, 0. 7, 1. 0, and 1. 3), two droplet size distributions (count median diameters of 20 and 30 µm), and water loadings (measured in water mass fraction) ranging from 0. 0 to 0. 1. The injection of water mist in microgravity resulted in a uniformly distributed and quiescent droplet cloud. Lean flames with a parabolic flame front monotonically slowed down to a steady-state velocity through the <b>mist</b> <b>cloud.</b> Small droplet size distributions are consistently more effective than larger ones in suppressing the propagation of lean flames with the effect of droplet size diminishing at the lowest burning velocities. Increased water loading always results in slower flames, with lean flames more easily suppressed than richer ones. Flame extinction was obtained for lean flames with water mass fractions under 0. 05...|$|E
40|$|Architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio have {{questioned}} conventional approaches to spatial temporality {{and the situation}} of architecture since the late 1970 s. Now joined by Charles Renfro, the installation and architectural projects of their interdisciplinary design studio Diller Scofidio + Renfro {{are representative of the}} shift from the aesthetic architectures of post-modernism towards a critical architecture based upon the principles of time-based art. As a reflection on the question of duration and performance, this article returns to Diller Scofidio + Renfro's temporary structure for the Swiss Expo in 2002. Blur Building, or Blur, underlines the occurrence of time through its continuously shifting structure and ephemeral state. Located on a steel-viewing platform on Lake Neuchâtel, Blur was a literal performance of its lakeside site as a series of water jets formed a suspended <b>mist</b> <b>cloud</b> around its steel frame: an ephemeral architecture of water and action. This event-based spatial ecology of Blur is typical of Diller Scofidio + Renfro's focus on the affect of architecture and the social consequence of buildings. Influenced by their initial explorations within a theatrical setting, Diller Scofidio + Renfro integrate the experience of technology and architecture to evoke the social and material contexts of the ‘site’ or situation. Notions of spectatorship and participation recur throughout their architectural interventions, as they aim to position architecture as a means of spatial and haptic revelation: where the event of architectural experience has a direct impact upon our embodied perception of ourselves. Framed by Dorita Hannah's notion of ‘spatial performativity’ and the writings of architect's such as Juhani Pallasmaa and Bernard Tschumi, this article concludes with by reflecting on how Blur is representative of the critical discourses that have shaped contemporary approaches to site and performance, the dramaturgy of architecture...|$|E
