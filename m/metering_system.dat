25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical <b>metering</b> <b>system,</b> which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E

The efficient use of these products demands knowing their physical and mechanical properties, the storing conditions effect and the operational characteristics of the <b>metering</b> <b>systems</b> used in the fertilizing equipment. In this context, the present study was developed with the purpose of evaluating the operational characteristics of different fertilizing <b>metering</b> <b>systems</b> and to determine the adequate metering system-product operational parameters, using powder lime, powder gypsum, granular 10 - 30 - 10 (N-P-K), and granular urea. Operational differences were established among four types of commercial fertilizer <b>metering</b> <b>systems,</b> including wire auger, star-shaped feed wheel, feed screw and ridged traction wheel.

50|$|The main {{improvement}} of E-TTL II {{is that it}} gives a more natural flash exposure, {{by being able to}} handle tricky scenes where the old E-TTL system would normally be thrown off. Such improvements are possible because E-TTL II incorporates lens-to-subject distance information in its calculation, where available, to assist in determining an approximate guide number for flash output. The flash <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> is also no longer linked to the AF system, whereas in the old E-TTL metering, bias is given to the selected AF point. Rather, E-TTL II compares the ambient and the pre-flash light levels of the scene to determine where the subject lies, in conjunction with subject distance information if available. This gives the photographer the flexibility to lock focus and recompose the scene without fooling the flash <b>metering</b> <b>system.</b> 'Hotspots' (areas of high reflectance) that would normally throw off the flash <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> are also ignored in the calculation.|$|E
