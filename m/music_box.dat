5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, {{as well as her}} husband and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed to achieve the same success matched by her debut album. Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E
