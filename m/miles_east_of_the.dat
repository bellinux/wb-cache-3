5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 {{a few hundred}} <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leeward Islands. It was upgraded to a tropical storm late that evening. This marked the third time that the 'P' name {{had been used to}} name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950. The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted {{a few hundred}} <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. Although designated as an east–west highway, it is nearly a diagonal northwest–southeast route.

In between the trunkline runs through seven counties of {{the southern part of}} the Lower Peninsula mostly through rural farm fields and small communities. The highway also runs through downtown Jackson to connect between two freeway sections of US127.

5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gladys was the {{farthest}} tropical cyclone from the United States {{to be observed}} by radar in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Carla in 1961. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season, Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several hundred miles southwest of Cape Verde on September22. Initially, the tropical depression failed to strengthened significantly, but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September24. Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern Leeward Islands, Gladys became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scaleon September28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. Eventually, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge {{is out of}} {{alignment}} with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 to 2.2 <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first {{as a result of}} a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{ends in the}} {{community}} of Greenwater, named for the river, where the roadway encounters Forest Road70, which has been proposed to become SR168 over Naches Pass {{as an alternative to the}} Chinook Scenic Byway. From Greenwater, the road travels south alongside the White River into Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, passing Ranger Creek State Airport, a state-owned airport that is open in the summer and early fall. The byway travels south into Mount Rainier National Park. SR 410 is closed at the gate to Morse Creek, about 5 <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinook Pass Summit during the winter and early spring due to high wind, limited cell service and avalanche danger. It intersects SR123 at Cayuse Pass. SR410 turns east at the intersection and heads through a series of hairpin turns, passing Tipsoo Lake, to Chinook Pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of Warner & Swasey Company, which made precision instruments and telescopes {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to Case Institute of Technology), and built an observatory in East Cleveland, which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university campus and housed a 9.5-inch refractor, and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, {{as well as an}} astronomical library and public lecture hall.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Thad {{originated}} from an active monsoon trough several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines in mid-August1981. On August10, a weak surface circulation was first noted on satellite imagery. At that time, {{the center was}} embedded within the monsoon trough. Within five days, the system developed outflow. Midday on August15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system. Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 1800UTC on August15. Situated south of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone was located within a favorable environment for further development. Early on August16, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm. Following an increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Depression 15 that day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Jose was {{the fourteenth}} {{tropical}} cyclone, tenth named storm, and eighth hurricane {{of the annual}} season that caused moderate damage in the Lesser Antilles in October 1999. Jose developed from a tropical wave several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Windward Islands on October 17. The depression intensified and was subsequently upgraded to Tropical Storm Jose on October 18. The storm tracked northwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane the following day as it approached the northern Leeward Islands. Jose briefly peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) on October 20. However, wind shear weakened the storm back to a Category 1 hurricane before it struck Antigua. Further deterioration occurred and Jose weakened to a tropical storm before landfall in Tortola on October 21. While located north of Puerto Rico on October 22, the storm turned northward, shortly before curving north-northeastward. Wind shear decreased, allowing Jose to re-intensify into a hurricane while passing east of Bermuda on October 24. However, on the following day, wind shear increased again, while sea surface temperatures decreased, causing Jose to weaken and quickly transition into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
