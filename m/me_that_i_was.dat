5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|Asimov {{said that}} Campbell was [...] "talkative, opinionated, quicksilver-minded, overbearing. Talking to him meant {{listening}} to a monologue..." [...] Knight agreed: [...] "Campbell's lecture-room manner was so unpleasant to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unwilling to face it. Campbell talked {{a good deal more}} than he listened, and he liked to say outrageous things." ...|$|E
500|$|Between the {{publication}} of The Pothunters 1902 and that of Mike in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R.D.B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: [...] "I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to write at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E

500|$|Goddard {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} Brad Snyder on As the World Turns, {{and though he}} was not cast in the part, Barbara Bloom, the senior vice-president of CBS Daytime, recommended Goddard to The Young and the Restlesss head writer and executive producer, Latham. After testing for the character of Cane for Latham and casting director Karen Rea, Goddard received the role. The Australian actor auditioned with an American accent, but when the writers found out about his Australian background, that influenced Cane's backstory. The actor stated that, [...] "The concept of Cane {{was that he was}} given away at birth. So he could have been from Mongolia. It just worked out luckily for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the right person for the job." [...] Since the producers could not understand the actor's real Australian accent, Goddard [...] "Americanized" [...] it while portraying the character.|$|E
500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile to me. We were talking about guns and she said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date {{with his wife and}} Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E

500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|French {{has claimed}} that her {{self-confidence}} and self-belief stem from her father, {{who told her}} how beautiful she was each day. She stated, [...] "He taught me to value myself.

[...] He {{had a history of}} severe depression and attempted suicides but managed to conceal his illness from Dawn and her brother.|$|E
2500|$|Later, a Baton Rouge rape {{survivor}} confronted Vitter at a {{town hall}} meeting saying, [...] " [...] meant everything to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to put the person who attacked me behind bars ... How can you support a law that tells a rape victim that she does {{not have the right to}} defend herself?" [...] Vitter replied, [...] "The language in question did not say that in any way shape or form." ...|$|E

2500|$|His first movie, 12 Angry Men, was an auspicious {{beginning}} for Lumet. It {{was a critical}} success and established Lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures. For US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, seeing the film {{for the first time}} was a pivotal moment in her life, as she was at that time considering a career in law. [...] "It told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the right path," [...] she said. Fully half of Lumet's complement of films have originated in the theater.|$|E

[...] "And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's {{going to make this}} thing work.

2500|$|Regarding {{agreeing to}} play at Live 8, he said: [...] "There {{was more than one}} reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable {{relationship}} between Roger and <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> carrying along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The motifs I {{was able}} to select from this milieu (the workers' lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I {{discovered}} to be beautiful.... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I {{got to know the}} women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, he {{was given}} the title of Lance Corporal, which he was very proud of. Alexei's {{favorites}} were the foreigners of Belgium, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and Serbia, and in favor, adopted him as their mascot. Hanbury-Williams, whom Alexei liked, wrote [...] " [...] As time went on and his shyness wore off he treated us like old friends and… had always some bit fun with us. With me it was to make sure that each button on my coat was properly fastened, a habit which naturally made me take great care to have one or two unbuttoned, in which case he used to at once to stop and tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 'untidy again,' give a sigh at my lack of attention to these details and stop and carefully button me up again.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Manson {{announced}} she was stepping away from music, claiming she got {{sick of the}} music industry's new practices and had found more excitement in acting. Manson said she thought about abandoning the music business as soon as 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that [...] "I didn't want to make music, didn't feel creative. I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it {{meant so much to}} them that I could sing that song and so much to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to do something.
