5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other <b>mechanical</b> <b>injury</b> to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
25|$|A {{primary concern}} of the bite of a spider {{is the effect of}} its venom. A spider {{envenomation}} occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites involve injection of venom, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>injury</b> from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. However, it is generally the toxicity of spider venom that poses the most risk to human beings; several spiders are known to have venom that can cause injury to humans in the amounts that a spider could inject when biting.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>injuries</b> and {{diseases}} in stone fruit are important causes for market rejection. The objectives {{of this research}} were to quantify and characterize the <b>mechanical</b> <b>injuries</b> {{and diseases}} in peaches, nectarines and plums at Sao Paulo`s wholesale market, the largest in Brazil. Incidence of injuries was assessed weekly in 1 % of the marketed fruit (2973 fruit/week), from September to December in 2003 and 2004. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>injuries</b> were the most frequent injuries in both years, ranging from 8. 73 % (plum) to 44. 5 % (nectarine) of injured fruit. There was a significant positive correlation between the incidence of postharvest <b>mechanical</b> <b>injuries</b> and postharvest diseases. Incidence of postharvest diseases varied from 2. 5 % to 6. 6 %. Cladosporium rot (Cladosporium sp.) and brown rot (Monilinia fructicola) were the most frequent diseases, and were mostly detected in the apexes of nectarines and peaches. Aurora (peach), Sunraycer (nectarine) and Gulfblaze (plum) varieties were the most susceptible to injuries and diseases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The seed coat {{develops}} {{from the}} maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed {{can be a}} paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from <b>mechanical</b> <b>injury,</b> predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.|$|E
25|$|Inoffensive to humans, {{the eastern}} shovelnose stingaree {{can be easily}} {{approached}} underwater. Its flesh is edible, albeit rather chewy unless properly prepared. This species is caught incidentally by coastal commercial fisheries in beach and Danish seines and bottom trawls, especially by the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). As it is taken from shallow water it often survives to be discarded, though of concern is <b>mechanical</b> <b>injury</b> when heavier fishing gear is involved, {{as well as the}} propensity for stingarees to abort their young when captured. Further threats to this species may include habitat degradation and disturbance from coastal development and recreational activities, and invasive species. The eastern shovelnose stingaree population of Port Phillip is known to have declined over the past decade, which coupled with continuing fishing pressure has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list it as Near Threatened. Its range does encompass some refuge areas, such as the Bass Strait where little trawling occurs, and several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) recently set aside off Victoria. It would also potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E

Species of Rhizopus (e.g. [...] Rhizopus stolonifer, Rhizopus nigricans) cause bulb soft rot and Sclerotinia bulborum, black slime disease. A combination of both Peyronellaea curtisii (Stagonosporopsis curtisii) and Botrytis narcissicola causes neck rot in the bulbs.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "bystander effect" [...] {{with its}} connotations of the {{innocent}} bystander being killed is also mediated by gap junctions. When cells are compromised due to disease or injury and start to die messages are transmitted to neighboring cells connected to the dying cell by gap junctions. This can cause the otherwise unaffected healthy bystander cells to also die. The bystander effect is, therefore, important to consider in diseased cells, which opened an avenue for more funding and a flourish of research. Later the bystander effect was also researched with regard to cells damaged by radiation or <b>mechanical</b> <b>injury</b> and therefore wound healing. Disease also seems {{to have an effect}} on the ability of gap junctions to fulfill their roles in wound healing.|$|E
