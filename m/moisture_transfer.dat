50|$|The mid {{layer is}} needed in cold weather to provide {{additional}} insulation. The use of multiple thin layers facilitates adjustment of warmth. The mid layer should be more loose-fitting than the inner layer, as this leaves insulating air between the layers. However, if best possible <b>moisture</b> <b>transfer</b> is desired, too great a gap between any adjacent layers of clothing may reduce the <b>moisture</b> <b>transfer</b> by capillary action from one piece of clothing to another. On the other hand, very loose-fitting layers can allow more removal of moisture (and heat) via air circulation.|$|E

It addresses the mechanisms involved in the hygrothermal transfers. The chapter discusses on the driving potential in porous media and their sensitivity on the transfer. Porous media may be regarded as macroscopically heterogeneous and anisotropic. Coupled heat and <b>moisture</b> <b>transfers</b> in porous media are explored in many scientific areas such as wood drying, hygroscopic textile materials, food and building envelopes, among others. The water vapor permeability is not only dependent on the material and its thickness, but also on the vapor pressure applied on the material.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one way {{to determine}} the best operating conditions would be creating a mathematical model or process model using software to simulate the vibrating fluidized bed for the desired process.The effects of gas velocity and temperature were modelled. One optimal operating condition would be increasing the drying rate. This is because with increased drying rate, the drying process in the vibrating fluidized bed will be shorter giving the vibrating fluidized bed an overall better efficiency. There are 3 major mechanisms which determine the drying rate. The mechanisms are the heat & mass transfer in the gas side, the thermodynamic equilibrium in between the two phases during contact and the heat & mass transfer within the wet solid. These three mechanisms will increase with the increase in gas velocity as well as the heat & mass transfer coefficient. This will then cause the drying rate to increase because of the increase in gas temperature which causes the gas humidity to decrease.The effects of particle size were modelled as well. It was found that. Larger particle need longer time to dry to reach the same moisture content due to increase in resistance within the particles against heat and mass transfer. Since the resistance against heat transfer within the particle is lower than the resistance against mass transfer; the convection heat not used to vaporize water is used to elevate the material temperature which will lead to higher <b>moisture</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficients within the particles and will cause higher drying rate. Therefore, it was concluded that for optimum operating conditions to be achieved, the particles which are fed into the vibratory fluidized bed should be decreased. Usually the particle size of the feed material is not a controlled parameter unless methods such as grinding are used but doing so would involve extra operating cost which should be avoided. Hence, another option would be by increasing the intensity of the vibrations in the vibrating fluidized bed.|$|E
