40|$|The {{influence}} of levels of monensin, a polyethor ionophore, on digestibility, rumenal diet protein degradation and bacterial protein synthesis when steers are fed high fiber diets {{was investigated in}} two <b>metabolism</b> <b>trials.</b> In addition, three performance trials were used to evaluate monensin levels when protein or energy was the first limiting nutrient and to evaluate possible interactions of forage quality and monensin level. ^ The level of monensin influenced organic matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and ruminal NDF digestibilities in a quadratic manner, with the intermediate levels of monensin being superior to either high levels of monensin or no monensin. Monensin decreased (P =. 10) the bacterial protein concentration and increased (P =. 02) the ratio of total N:diaminopimilic acid in the rumen. In duodenally cannulated steers, a linear tendency for bacterial N flow to decrease (P =. 17) and for diet N flow to increase (P =. 27) was observed. This resulted in no overall difference in duodenal N flow or flow of individual amino acids. The data indicate {{that it may be}} possible to obtain both improved fiber digestion and increased diet N to the lower tract with supplementation of monensin at 18. 3 ppm. ^ In a calf performance trial when energy was first limiting no interaction of forage quality and monensin was observed.

40|$|One {{metabolism}} and three finishing trials {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of corn processing on degradable intake protein requirements of feedlot cattle.

The finishing trial included 60 individually fed crossbred beef steer calves (237 kg; SD = 20 kg) supplemented with either incremental amounts of rumen-protected Lys and Met, or Met alone. Addition of Lys and Met improved gains and efficiencies (quadratic; P 3 ̆c. 02) during the first 56 d. There was no response to supplemental Met alone, suggesting that supplemental Lys rather than Met was responsible for the improvement in performance. Using nonlinear analyses to compare gain relative to supplemental Lys intake, maximum gain was determined to be 2. 10 kg/ d, or. 27 kg/d above the zero Lys control, at a supplemental Lys intake of 2. 56 g/d. Steers supplemented with 3 and 4 g of Lys had a weight advantage over the control steers of 16 kg at 56 d and 32 kg {{at the end of the}} 161 - d trial.

A total of 58 conventional <b>metabolism</b> <b>trials,</b> carried out with sheep fed 27 forages (offered pure or in mixture) used in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) during the period 1969 – 1989 was analyzed. OM intake and OM digestibility (OMD) results were regressed linearly against fecal N, and OMD was also estimated from fecal crude protein (N× 6. 25) content by a non-linear regression model. Fecal nitrogen excretion estimated forage intake in sheep with an R 2 = 0. 73, whereas a low R 2 value of 0. 36 was observed for OMD estimates. The equation obtained using the non-linear model was OMD= 0. 7326 − 0. 3598 exp [(− 0. 9052 CP (g/kgOM)) / 100].

Dietary treatments were expected to create different MCP flows in each trial. In the growing trial, three supplemental protein sources differing in degradability of protein were fed with and without steep liquor (SL). Inclusion of SL did not change protein efficiency with AminoPlus ® and Soypass® being higher than soybean meal (SBM). Estimates of MCP and microbial efficiency were increased with inclusion of SL and increased with increasing level of supplemental protein. In the finishing and <b>metabolism</b> <b>trial,</b> corn bran inclusion and supplementation of SBM instead of urea in high-moisture corn diets were expected to increase MCP efficiency and flow. Corn bran and SBM only impacted performance early in the feeding period for finishing heifers.

Intake of dry matter (DM) (p 0. 05) while urinary N increased as the level of UDP decreased (p 0. 05) or interaction between dietary treatments (p> 0. 05). Daily excretion of creatinine was not affected by dietary treatments (p 0. 05) and a good correlation was found between the PDC index (average value of three times) of spot urine and daily excretion of PD (R 2 = 0. 88). These results suggest that for animals fed ad libitum, the PDC index in spot urine is effective to predict daily excretion of PD. In order to improve the accuracy of the spot sampling technique, an appropriate lag phase between the time of feeding and sampling should be determined so that the sampling time can coincide with the peak concentration of PD in the urine...|$|E
40|$|A <b>metabolism</b> <b>trial</b> on {{nitrogen}} and energy utilization was conducted using thirty male crossbred calves blocked {{by age and}} {{randomly assigned to one}} of the dietary treatment consisting of ad libitum tef straw alone or supplemented with three levels (0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 percent of the body weight) of cowpea or lablab hay. Supplementation and increasing the level to the supplements increased the intake of nitrogen, the excretion of faecal and urinary nitrogen, N digestibility and the amount of nitrogen retained the calves. Moreover, the intakes of gross and digestible energy and urinary energy output increased in response to supplementation and increasing levels of the supplements. The supplement types had a similar effect on {{nitrogen and}} energy utilization. In conclusion, tef straw, when fed alone, cannot maintain nitrogen equilibrium. Therefore, it requires supplementation...|$|E
40|$|Two <b>metabolism</b> <b>trials</b> were {{conducted}} with 12 yearling crossbred wethers per trial (34 and 38 kg for trials 1 and 2, respectively). The wethers, equipped with ruminal, abomasal and ileal cannulae, were randomly allotted for each trial to the following treatments: 1) hay alone or hay supplemented with 2). 9 % urea, 3) 1 % urea and 6. 5 % molasses or 4) 1 % urea and 5. 2 % corn. Two digestive flow markers were used: Cr 2 O 3 powder and Co-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Co-EDTA). Urea and Co-EDTA were infused continuously into the rumen via cannula. Daily dry matter (DM) intake averaged 517 g. Urea supplementation improved N retention (P less than. 01). Apparent digestibility of DM, acid detergent fiber (ADF) and energy was not affected by treatment. Urea and carbohydrate supplementation increased ruminal propionic acid molar proportions (P less than. 05). Apparent ruminal DM digestion accounted for 41 % of the total DM degraded, whereas 77. 4 % of the digestible ADF was degraded in the rumen. Urea supplementation increased ADF digestion in the large intestine (P less than. 01). Urea and carbohydrate supplementation resulted in a stepwise increase in N flowing with the liquid phase at the abomasum. Mean retention times of the solid and liquid phases of digestive contents were similar across treatments. Overall, benefits of supplementation of poor-quality fescue hay diets by small amounts of urea and readily available carbohydrates remain questionable for sheep fed at a fixed level of intake below maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Samples were {{analyzed}} from three <b>metabolism</b> <b>trials</b> {{to evaluate the}} effects of dietary phosphorus (P) intake on P excretion in beef steers fed corn-based finishing diets. In Experiment I, ten steers were fed ten diets that involved two processing methods, whole and dry rolled corn and five corn sources, commodity, white, high oil, high protein, and highoil-high-protein corn. In Experiment II, six steers were fed three diets that included three variations of protein supplementation to meet 70, 80, and 100 % of the degradable intake protein requirements for growing steers. In Experiment III, ten steers were fed five diets including control, 4 % or 8 % distillers solubles, and 10 % or 20 % wet distillers grains. For all experiments total urine and feces, feed intake, and feed refused were measured during a 5 -d collection period, following 9, 10 and 14 -d of dietary adaptation for the three respective experiments. Dietary P concentration (% DM) and dietary P intake (g/d) ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 36 and 21. 5 to 27. 2, 0. 28 to 0. 29 and 19. 8 to 21. 2 and 0. 29 to 0. 40 and 22. 9 to 34. 5 in the three respective experiments. Total P excretion {{was significantly related to}} P intake, but there was considerable variation among steers in partitioning excretion of P in urine or feces. Urinary P excretion (g/d) ranged from 3. 0 to 7. 4, 3. 1 to 4. 3 and 4. 3 to 7. 5 in the three studies, respectively. Replacing corn grain with corn processing co-products increased P intake but did not significantly change excretion patterns...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{metabolism}} experiments investigated {{the recovery of}} continuous-, intravenously infused chromium complexed with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (CrEDTA) and lithium sulphate in the urine of cattle {{with a view to}} using the markers to estimate urine and metabolite output in grazing cattle. The recovery of Cr in urine from these infusions was similar (90 %) in <b>metabolism</b> <b>trials</b> when cattle consumed three very contrasting diets: high-grain formulated pellet, lucerne hay (Medicago sativa) or low-quality native grass hay (predominantly Heteropogon contortus). By contrast, Li recovery in urine averaged 46. 3 +/- 0. 40 % and 72. 6 +/- 0. 43 % for native pasture and lucerne hays, respectively, but was not constant across days. There was negligible transfer of Cr from CrEDTA in blood serum to the rumen or faeces, whereas appreciable quantities of infused Li were found in both. The ratio of urine volume estimated by spot samples and marker dilution of Cr, to urine volume measured gravimetrically, was 1. 05. In grazing studies using rumen-fistulated (RF) steers grazing seven different tropical and temperate grass and legume pastures, the ratio of concentrations of purine derivatives (PD) to Cr in spot samples of urine was shown to vary diurnally in the range of 49 % to 157 % of the average 24 h value. This finding indicated the need for regular sampling of urine to achieve an accurate average value for the PD: Cr ratio in urine for use in estimating urinary PD excretion and hence microbial protein production in the rumen. It was concluded that continuous, intravenous infusion of CrEDTA resulted in a constant recovery of Cr in the urine of cattle across diets and, provided an intensive sampling regime was followed to account for diurnal variation, it would be suitable as a marker to estimate urine volume and urinary output of PD in grazing cattle...|$|R
