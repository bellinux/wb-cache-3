2500|$|The modern {{pharmaceutical}} industry traces its roots to two sources. [...] The {{first of these}} were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of <b>morphine,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and sleep-inducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner, who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of Glaxo Smith Kline), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s. [...] By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. It {{is known}} that bile acids improve the absorption, {{bioavailability}} and pharmacodynamic characteristics of some drugs. Morphine analgesia is produced by activation of opioid receptors within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) at both spinal and supraspinal levels. Since a morphine molecule contains 3 polar groups and therefore hard to transfer through the blood-brain barrier, the aim {{of the study was to}} examine the potential influence of bile acids derivates, namely sodium salt of monoketocholic acid (MKH-Na) and methyl ester of monoketocholic acid (MKH-Me), on analgesic effect of morphine. Methods. White male mice of NMRI-Haan strain, with body weight of 20 - 24 g, were used in this study. The analgesic effect of morphine (administered by subcutaneous and intramuscular route in a dose of 2 mg/kg), with and without pretreatment with MKH-Na (4 mg/kg) and MKH-Me (4 mg/kg) was estimated by the hot plate method. Results. Administration of MKH-Me prior to subcutaneous administration of morphine increased the <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect but the increase was not statistically significant. At the same time administration of MKH-Na did not affect <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect. The analgesic effect of morphine increased when administered intramuscularly 20 min after MKH-Me administration. When compared with the group of animals treated only with morphine, a statistically significant increase in analgesic effect was detected 10, 30, 40 and 50 min after morphine administration (p < 0. 05). Pretreatment with MKH-Na did not affect <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect. Conclusion. According to the results of this study it can be presumed that after intramuscular morphine administration methyl ester of monoketocholic acid increases morphine transport into the central nervous system and consequently the analgesic effect, as well. Further research on bile acids-morphine interaction both in vitro and in vivo is necessary to completely elucidate the mechanism of this interaction and increase in the <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect.

Previous studies demonstrated that both alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors (alpha 2 -AR) or I 2 Imidazoline Binding Sites (I 2 -IBS) are involved in the modulation of morphine analgesia as well as tolerance and dependence. Our studies demonstrated that in molecular structures, sharing the common pharmacophore reported in figure 1, the bridge X determined the preferential recognition of a specific biological system. In particular, the -OCH(CH 3) - bridge of 1 was suitable for alpha 2 -AR interaction, whereas the -CH 2 CH 2 - bridge (2) proved to be effective for I 2 -IBS. Interestingly, the -OCH 2 - bridge (3) was compatible with both systems.

40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} demonstrated that peripheral inflammatory pain (PIP), induced by subcutaneous plantar injection of l-carrageenan, results in increased expression and {{activity of the}} ATP-dependent efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that is endogenously expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The result of increased P-gp functional expression was {{a significant reduction in}} CNS uptake of morphine and, subsequently, reduced <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> efficacy. A major concern in the treatment of acute pain/inflammation is the potential for drug-drug interactions resulting from P-gp induction by therapeutic agents co-administered with opioids. Such effects on P-gp activity can profoundly modulate CNS distribution of opioid analgesics and alter analgesic efficacy. In this study, we examined the ability of diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly administered in conjunction with the opioids during pain therapy, to alter BBB transport of morphine via P-gp and whether such changes in P-gp morphine transport could alter <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> efficacy. Administration of diclofenac reduced paw edema and thermal hyperalgesia in rats subjected to PIP, which is consistent with the known mechanism of action of this NSAID. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase in P-gp expression in rat brain microvessels not only following PIP induction but also after diclofenac treatment alone. Additionally, in situ brain perfusion studies showed that both PIP and diclofenac treatment alone increased P-gp efflux activity resulting in decreased morphine brain uptake.

40|$|Abstract Background The neuropeptide, {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) {{has been}} proposed to be a regulator {{of the development of}} <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> tolerance and thereby could be a target to reduce the induction of this phenomenon under clinical conditions. However, the mechanisms of CGRP regulation are unclear. We investigated here the possible role of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p 38 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in CGRP regulation following chronic morphine treatment. Results A 7 -day treatment with morphine (15 μg/day) led to an increase in CGRP contents in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and this effect was prevented by the inhibition of the ERK, p 38 or CaMKII pathway. The phosphorylation/activation of ERK, p 38 and CaMKII was enhanced in the SCDH following chronic morphine while in DRG only the phosphorylation of CaMKII was increased. Moreover, our chronic morphine treatment up-regulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) levels in the SCDH, an effect blocked by the inhibition of the ERK, p 38 or CaMKII pathway. The blockade of nNOS activity also suppressed chronic morphine-induced CGRP increases in the DRG and SCDH. Double immunofluorescence studies revealed that nNOS and CaMKII are co-localized in the SCDH and that CaMKII is activated in CGRP-expressing DRG neurons. Conclusions The activation of spinal ERK, p 38 and CaMKII, alongside nNOS, is involved in chronic morphine-induced CGRP up-regulation in both the DRG and SCDH. Moreover, the stimulation of CaMKII in the DRG likely directly regulates the expression of CGRP associated with <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> tolerance. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of morphine dosing time on analgesic effect after acute or chronic treatment, recovery of analgesic effect after once developed tolerance, and their pharmacological mecha-nisms were investigated in ICR male mice under a 12 -h light/ dark cycle (light on from 7 : 00 AM to 7 : 00 PM). There {{was a significant}} 24 -h rhythm in the latency of thermal response at 30 min after morphine injection. The analgesic effect was signifi-cantly greater at the dark phase than at the light phase. The rhythmic pattern resembled overall the rhythm occurring in the latency of thermal response under nondrugged state. The ab-solute value of <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect (the real time spent on the hot-plate) on days 1 and 2 after morphine daily injection was significantly larger after morphine injection at 9 : 00 PM than after saline injection at 9 : 00 PM or after morphine injection at 9 : 00 AM. The recovery from tolerance of analgesic effect was significantly faster at the dark phase than at the light phase. The time-dependent difference in the analgesic effect after chronic treatment or recovery from tolerance {{is closely related to}} that in the expression of -opioid receptor.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Morphine {{injected}} locally to the paw of {{an adult}} or an infant rat is analgesic. Opiates specific to m and k opioid receptors, and less consistently to d opioid receptors, given locally {{to the site of}} injury in adult animals are also analgesic in a variety of models of inflammatory pain. To determine which opioid receptor(s) are involved in local analgesia in the immature animal, agonists specific for m, k, and d opioid receptors were injected into the intraplantar pad in infant rats and the resultant nociceptive behavior and Fos expression assayed in the formalin test. The k opioid receptor agonist U 50, 488 reduced nociceptive behavior in both phases of the formalin test and reduced Fos expression in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord, at 3 and 21 days of age. Morphiceptin (m opioid agonist) was analgesic in the 21 -day-old pups, but not the 3 -day-old pups, measured behaviorally or by Fos expression. DPDPE (d opioid agonist) was not analgesic at either age. We also tested the effects of opioid receptor antagonists on <b>morphine’s</b> local <b>analgesic</b> action.

Further studies established a functional link between p 38 MAPK and the small GTPase Rab 5, a key regulator of endocytosis. Expression of an activated mutant of Rab 5 stimulated endocytosis of MOR ligand-independently in wild-type but not in p 38 α−/− cells. We found that p 38 α can phosphorylate the Rab 5 effectors EEA 1 and Rabenosyn- 5 on Thr- 1392 and Ser- 215, respectively, and these phosphorylation events regulate the recruitment of EEA 1 and Rabenosyn- 5 to membranes. Moreover, phosphomimetic mutation of Thr- 1392 in EEA 1 can bypass the requirement for p 38 α in MOR endocytosis.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that serotonin concentration was reduced {{in the brain}} of mice with neuropathic pain and {{that it may be}} related to reduction of <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effects. To further prove this pharmacological action, we applied fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to determine whether it suppressed neuropathic pain and examined how its different administration routes would affect antinociceptive and antiallodynic effects of morphine in diabetic (DM) and sciatic nerve ligation (SL) mice, as models of neuropathic pain. Antiallodynia and antinociceptive effect of drugs were measured by using von Frey filament and tail pinch tests, respectively. Fluoxetine given alone, intracerebroventicularly (i. c. v., 15 μg/mouse) or intraperitoneally (i. p., 5 and 10 mg/kg) did not produce any effect in either model. However, fluoxetine given i. p. enhanced both antiallodynic and antinociceptive effects of morphine. Administration of fluoxetine i. c. v., slightly enhanced only the antiallodynic effect of morphine in SL mice. Ketanserine, a serotonin 2 A receptor antagonist (i. p., 1 mg/kg) and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist (i. p., 3 mg/kg), blocked the combined antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine and morphine. Our data show that fluoxetine itself lacks antinociceptive properties in the two neuropathy models, but it enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in the periphery and suggests that co-administration of morphine with fluoxetine may have therapeutic potential in treatment of neuropathic pain...|$|E

We firstly investigated the effects of TDZD- 8, a selective GSK- 3 β inhibitor, on thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia using a rat model of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. GSK- 3 β activity as well as NMDA receptor subunits (NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B) expression and trafficking in spinal cord L 4 -L 5 segments were measured by Western blot analysis.

However, how DRG DNMT 3 a is increased following peripheral nerve injury is still elusive. We reported here that peripheral nerve injury caused by the fifth spinal nerve ligation (SNL) downregulated microRNA (miR) - 143 expression in injured DRG. This downregulation was required for SNL-induced DRG Dnmt 3 a increase as rescuing miR- 143 downregulation through microinjection of miR- 143 mimics into injured DRG blocked the SNL-induced increase in Dnmt 3 a and restored the SNL-induced decreases in Oprm 1 mRNA and its encoding mu opioid receptor (MOR) in injured DRG, impaired spinal cord central sensitization and neuropathic pain, and improved <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> effects following SNL.

The distal part of the uterine artery was embolized with polyvinyl alcohol particles via catheterization of the right femoral artery. Total abdominal hysterectomy was performed the next day. RESULTS. Bilateral embolization in two patients resulted in considerable pain that required <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> medication and epidural analgesia. One patient was embolized unilaterally and experienced only slight discomfort with no need for analgesic medication at all, indicating that unilateral embolization is a well-tolerated method. After embolization, angiography showed stagnant flow in embolized vessels without contrast filling of distal branches. Angiography of the specimen showed normal vascular architecture in non-treated vessels. In treated vessels the main arterial trunks were patent but all smaller branches were occluded.

40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of morphine induced a hyperalgesic {{response in the}} hot plate test, at an extremely low dose (1 - 10 microg/kg). We have examined in vivo whether morphine, at an extremely low dose, induces acute central hypernociception following activation of the opioid receptor-mediated PLC/PKC inositol-lipid signaling pathway. The PLC inhibitor U 73122 and the PKC blocker, calphostin C, dose dependently prevented the thermal hypernociception induced by morphine. This effect was also prevented by pretreatment with aODN against PLCbeta 3 at 2 nmol/mouse and PKCgamma at 2 - 3 nmol/mouse. Low dose morphine hyperalgesia was dose dependently reversed by selective NMDA antagonist MK 801 and ketamine. This study demonstrates {{the presence of a}} nociceptive PLCbeta 3 /PKCgamma/NMDA pathway stimulated by low concentrations of morphine, through muOR 1 receptor, in mouse brain. This signaling pathway appears to play an opposing role in morphine analgesia. When mice were treated with a <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesic</b> dose (7 mg/kg), the downregulation of PLCbeta 3 or PKCgamma at the same aODN doses used for the prevention of the hyperalgesic effect induced, respectively, a 46 % and 67 % potentiation in analgesic response.

However, {{it remains to be}} determined whether KO 2 is capable of inducing other inflammatory and nociceptive responses attributed to superoxide anion. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the nociceptive and inflammatory effects of KO 2. The KO 2 -induced inflammatory responses evaluated in mice were: mechanical hyperalgesia (electronic version of von Frey filaments), thermal hyperalgesia (hot plate), edema (caliper rule), myeloperoxidase activity (colorimetric assay), overt pain-like behaviors (flinches, time spent licking and writhing score), leukocyte recruitment, oxidative stress, and cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA expression (quantitative PCR). Administration of KO 2 induced mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia, paw edema, leukocyte recruitment, the writhing response, paw flinching, and paw licking in a dose-dependent manner. KO 2 also induced time-dependent cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA expression in the paw skin. The nociceptive, inflammatory, and oxidative stress components of KO 2 -induced responses were responsive to <b>morphine</b> (<b>analgesic</b> opioid), quercetin (antioxidant flavonoid), and/or celecoxib (anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor) treatment. In conclusion, the well-established superoxide anion donor KO 2 is a valuable tool for studying the mechanisms and pharmacological susceptibilities of superoxide anion-triggered nociceptive and inflammatory responses ranging from mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia to overt pain-like behaviors, edema, and leukocyte recruitment...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveChronic {{low back}} pain is a major {{socioeconomic}} health issue, due to the high direct (healthcare) and indirect (sick leave) costs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe the primary care management of {{low back pain}} patients prior to their inclusion in a multidisciplinary functional restoration network. Methods A descriptive, retrospective, questionnaire-based survey of the general practitioners dealing with 72 low back pain patients. Results Patients had been monitored by their general practitioner for an average of four years, with a mean frequency of eight appointments per year per patient. Ninety-three percent and 60 % of the patients had been referred to a rheumatologist and a surgeon, respectively. Ninety-eight percent had had lumbar radiographies, 80 % had undergone a computed tomography scan and 64 % had undergone magnetic resonance imaging. The most commonly prescribed medications were anti-inflammatories and first- or second-line analgesics. Thirty percent had already received <b>morphine</b> <b>analgesics</b> and 50 % had taken antidepressants. Thirty-two percent had undergone lumbar surgery. Physiotherapy was frequently reported and, indeed, 6 % of patients had participated in over 100 sessions. Total sick leave averaged 8. 25 months over the study’s follow-up period. Conclusion The time interval before referral to a multidisciplinary care team is long and so GPs should be encouraged and helped to organize this process earlier. It is also essential to determine factors which predict progression to chronic LBP...|$|R

25|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{example of}} this phenomenon {{is the use of}} <b>morphine</b> or other <b>analgesic</b> in the dying patient. Such use of morphine can have the beneficial effect of easing the pain and suffering of the patient while simultaneously having the maleficent effect of shortening the life of the patient through suppression of the respiratory system.|$|R
