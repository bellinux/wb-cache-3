5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with <b>mud,</b> <b>plant</b> secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E

Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 34 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 34 consists of four Corrective Action Sites (CASs). The CAU is located within the Area 3 Compound at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>Mud</b> <b>Plant</b> Facility in Yucca Valley. Historically, CAS 03 - 09 - 07, Mud Pit, was used for disposal of excess mud from washing drilling equipment from 1968 to 1974, at which time it began to be used for excess mud disposal (currently inactive); CAS 03 - 44 - 01, Chromium Contamination Spill, was used to store additives used in the formulation of drilling mud from the early 1960 s to the mid- 1990 s; CAS 03 - 47 - 02, Area 3 <b>Mud</b> <b>Plant</b> Pond, was used as a freshwater storage reservoir for the <b>mud</b> <b>plant</b> as well as supplied water for a number of activities including the mixing of mud, the rinsing and cleaning of tanks, and various washdowns from the 1960 s through 1990 s; and CAS 03 - 09 - 06, Mud Disposal Crater, was created in 1962 by an underground nuclear detonation (i. e., Chinchilla test) and was used to mix and store mud, dispose of receiving waste from the <b>mud</b> <b>plant</b> floor drains and excess drilling mud, and clean/flush mix tanks through the mid- 1990 s. Based on site history, the scope of this plan is to identify potentially contaminated ground soil at each of the four CASs and determine the quantity, nature, and extent of contaminants of potential concern (COPCs). The investigation will include systematic and biased surface and subsurface soil and mud sampling using hand-auguring and direct-push techniques; visual, video, and/or electromagnetic surveys of pipes; field screening for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and alpha/beta-emitting radionuclides; and laboratory analysis to characterize any investigation-derived waste for disposal both on site at NTS and at off-site locations. Historical information provided by former NTS employees indicates that COPCs include VOCs, semivolatile organic compounds, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, gamma-emitting radionuclides, isotopic plutonium, and strontium- 90. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|E

40|$|Radiocarbon dating is used widely for the {{reconstruction}} of late Quaternary sea-level changes. In the present study, eight case studies in Hong Kong have been chosen to highlight the difficulty in obtaining reliable radiocarbon dates. Pre-Holocene radiocarbon dates exceeding about 8100 yr BP {{have been found to}} show a young age bias. A shell sample dated by two separate radiocarbon laboratories gave last interstadial ages differing by almost 9500 years while an oxygen-isotope stage 5 e age was obtained using uranium-series dating. Other evidence including stratigraphy has shown that only the last interglacial age is acceptable. The young age bias is attributed mainly to the post-depositional introduction of 'young' carbon into the sample. For {{the reconstruction}} of sea-level changes, it is essential to select samples immediately above the base of the Holocene transgressive unit in offshore boreholes and excavations to satisfy the criteria of rapid burial. These samples should preferably include <b>mud,</b> <b>plant</b> matter and shells to facilitate interpretation. Furthermore, as many samples as possible from a range of water depths down to about 130 m below the present sea level should be dated to reduce error introduced by counting statistics so the true signal of sea-level changes can be reflected. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This Corrective Action Decision Document {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 322, Areas 1 and 3 Release Sites and Injection Wells, Nevada Test Site, Nevada, {{in accordance with the}} ''Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order'' (1996). Corrective Action Unit 322 is comprised of the following corrective action sites (CASs) : (1) 01 - 25 - 01 - AST Release Site; (2) 03 - 25 - 03 - <b>Mud</b> <b>Plant</b> and AST Diesel Release; and (3) 03 - 20 - 05 - Injection Wells and BOP Shop. The purpose of this Corrective Action Decision Document is to identify and provide the rationale for the recommendation of a corrective action alternative for each CAS within CAU 322. Corrective action investigation activities were performed from April 2004 through September 2004, as set forth in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan. The purposes of the activities as defined during the data quality objectives process were: (1) Determine if contaminants of concern (COCs) are present; (2) If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent; and (3) Provide sufficient information and data to recommend appropriate corrective actions for the CASs. Analytes detected during the corrective action investigation were evaluated against appropriate preliminary action levels to identify contaminants of concern for each corrective action site. Radiological field measurements were compared to unrestricted release criteria. Assessment of the data generated from investigation activities revealed the following: (1) CAS 01 - 25 - 01 contains an AST berm contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) diesel-range organics (DRO). (2) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 includes two distinct areas: Area A where no contamination remains from a potential spill associated with an AST, and Area B where TPH-DRO contamination associated with various activities at the <b>mud</b> <b>plant</b> was identified. The Area B contamination was found at various locations and depths. (3) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 Area B contains TPH-DRO contamination at various locations and depths in the area associated with the <b>Mud</b> <b>Plant.</b> (4) CAS 03 - 20 - 05 contains TPH-DRO, metals, and radiological contamination within the injection well casing soil and TPH-DRO contamination at the depth coincidental with the bottom of the injection well sump. Based on the evaluation of analytical data from the corrective action investigation, review of future and current operations in Areas 1 and 3 of the Nevada Test Site, and the detailed and comparative analysis of the potential corrective action alternatives, the following corrective actions are recommended for the Corrective Action Unit 322 CASs. Closure in Place with Administrative Controls is the preferred corrective action for the following CASs: (1) CAS 01 - 25 - 01, removal of TPH-DRO contamination would pose a significant safety hazard due to the site location. (2) CAS 03 - 25 - 03 No contamination remains at Area A (AST Berm); and thus, no further action is the preferred alternative at this part of the CAS. However at Area B, TPH-DRO contamination is varied in concentration and location and the footprint of the CAS is large, removal of contaminated ''pockets'' would be laborious and cost prohibitive. The plutonium- 239 surface contamination identified at CAS 03 - 25 - 03 Area B has been removed and drummed as a best management practice. (3) CAS 03 - 20 - 05, TPH-DRO, metals, and radiological contamination are present in the injection well casing soils. Recommend corrective action includes removal of the liquid in the injection well sump (approximately 3 feet (ft) of liquid at 60 ft below ground surface), grouting the sump, and the area within the injection well casing. The plutonium- 239 surface contamination identified at CAS 03 - 20 - 05 has been removed and drummed as a best management practice and will be disposed of as low-level radioactive waste. It is recommended that the liquids be removed from the holding tank wells and the sumps of the two outer holding tanks within the BOP Shop, and the sumps be grouted, and the holding tanks filled in to the BOP Shop floor surface. The preferred corrective action alternatives were evaluated on technical merit focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety. The alternatives were judged to meet all requirements for the technical components evaluated. The alternatives meet all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will reduce potential future exposure pathways to the contaminated media at Corrective Action Unit 322...|$|E

Toward this end a far-reaching multimillion-dollar annual monitoring and surveillance program collects and analyzes tens of thousands of air, surface and groundwater, soil, <b>mud,</b> <b>plant,</b> and animal samples. This effort represents the work of many dedicated environmental scientists who carry out these extensive programs and work hard to protect and enhance the environment. We publish the results in a detailed Annual Site Environmental Report (ASER), and a separate Data Volume for those who wish to see the supporting data. These documents present all the facts and figures, but are highly technical and not easily understood, and it's essential we provide a summary document simple to read and understand. So each year I team with Karns High School and ask students to write an Annual Site Environmental Report Summary that will be both informative and enjoyable to read. These environmental documents are perhaps the most important DOE reports because they explain the environmental monitoring programs and show the consequences of our operations in great detail to our legislatures, stakeholders, and the public.
