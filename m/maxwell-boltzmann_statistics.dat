25|$|In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford {{were the}} first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a {{particle}} accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000electronvolts (100keV). This would be the energy of particles heated to thousands of millions of kelvins, but because the reaction releases so much energy, only a small proportion of particles need to be at this level to keep the reaction going. <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann</b> <b>statistics</b> suggest this would be true at much lower temperatures; in 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the reaction would be self-sustaining at about 50,000,000 K.|$|E

The orbital part of the motion is classical, whereas the spin degrees of freedom are treated in a completely quantum-mechanical way. The corresponding hydrodynamic equations are derived by taking velocity moments of the phase-space distribution function.

40|$|The {{rigorous}} {{version of}} the result that unifies <b>Maxwell-Boltzmann,</b> Bose-Einstein <b>statistics</b> and Zipf-Mandelbrot Law {{is presented in the}} paper. Additionally, the Fluctuation theorem is included. Both results are set in the rigorous probabilistic framework. The system under consideration is composed of fixed number of particles and energy smaller than some prescribed value. The particles are redistributed on fixed number of energy levels and are indistinguishable within one level. Further, the degenerations of energy levels are included and their number increases as the number of particles increase. The three distribution mentioned in the title corresponds to the three asymptotic cases of rate of increases of degenerations as a function of particles. When we take a thermodynamic limit for three cases we basically obtain the Law of Large Numbers and the obtained three means are our distributions. The fluctuations, i. e. the deviation from the mean turns out depends on the Entropy of the system. When its maximum is in inside of the domain we get Gaussian distribution. When it is on the boundary we get discrete distribution in the direction orthogonal to the boundary on which maximum is situated and Gaussian in other directions. The proof is similar for both results. The main part are the properties and asymptotic behavior of Entropy. Due to this we can optimize it and therefore apply probabilistic results which underlying assumptions overlap with ours and eventually get the desired results. Comment: 32 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} a real quantum theory with an orthogonal group, broken by an approximate i operator, supposed to underlie the present complex quantum theory, with its unitary group. A real quantum theory requires a real quantum statistics. We {{put forward a}} general concept of linear statistics that embraces the usual complex tensorial <b>statistics</b> (<b>Maxwell-Boltzmann,</b> Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein), the nonabelions of Read and Moore, the 2 -valued spinorial statistics of Wilczek, here called complex Clifford statistics, and a real Clifford statistics that we propose for elementary quantum events. We apply Clifford statistics to quanta here. A toy complex-Clifford model has the energy spectrum {{of a system of}} spin- 1 / 2 particles in an external magnetic field. This supports the proposal that the complex double-valued rotations — spin — seen at the quantum level of resolution arise from real doublevalued permutations — swap — to be seen at higher (ultra-quantum) resolution. A toy based on real Clifford statistics shows how an imaginary unit i can arise naturally within a real theory. PACS numbers: 03. 65. Bz, 03. 65. Fd...|$|R
40|$|Statistics links {{microscopic}} and macroscopic phenomena, {{and requires}} {{for this reason}} {{a large number of}} microscopic elements like atoms. The results are values of maximum probability or of averaging. This introduction to statistical physics concentrates on the basic principles, and attempts to explain these in simple terms supplemented by numerous examples. These basic principles include the difference between classical and quantum statistics, a priori probabilities as related to degeneracies, the vital aspect of indistinguishability as compared with distinguishability in classical physics, the differences between conserved and non-conserved elements, the different ways of counting arrangements in the three <b>statistics</b> (<b>Maxwell-Boltzmann,</b> Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein), the difference between maximization of the number of arrangements of elements, and averaging in the Darwin-Fowler method. Significant applications to solids, radiation and electrons in metals are treated in separate chapters, as well as Bose-Einstein condensation.
