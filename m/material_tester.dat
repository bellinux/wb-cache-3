40|$|Abstract. Measurement of {{mechanical}} properties of a thin large crystallized material such as TFT-LCD panel is challenging with traditional material testing equipments. Since TFT-LCDs are constructed with combination of brittle glass panels, polymer sheets, and liquid crystal, their properties {{are not only}} anisotropic but also usually non-linear. Accurate measurement of the properties often requires very expensive facilities. Especially when {{the size of the}} test sample is as large as 40 -inch or wider, direct measurement cost of even elastic modulus is prohibitive. On the other hand, machining of the large TFT-LCD to make a smaller size specimen that could be fit into a <b>material</b> <b>tester</b> is not possible due to leaking liquid crystal. A new method for the measurement of elastic modulus of large TFT-LCD panel is presented in this article.

In the present paper, the tensile properties, such as elastic modulus (Ec) and yield strength of glass bead-filled polypropylene (PP) composites were measured {{by using an}} Instron <b>material</b> <b>tester</b> at room temperature and varied tensile rates, to identify the effects of tensile rates and filler concentration on these tensile properties. The fillers were A-glass beads, and the surface was pretreated with silane coupling agent. The fillers and PP with different proportion were compounded in a twin-screw extruder in temperature range of 160 – 230 C to produce the composites. The {{results showed that the}} Ec increased nonlinearly with increasing the filler content at lower tensile rates, while it did not vary practically with the filler concentration at the highest tensile rate. When the filler content was a constant, Ec was approximately an exponential function of tensile strain rates, except for individual data points. The tensile yield stress (yc) decreased nonlinearly with the addition of the filler volume fraction ðf Þ at lower tensile rates, while it decreased almost linearly with the increase of f at highest tensile rate. Similarly, yc increased with increasing tensile strain rates as a form of index function. Furthermore, for these composites the relationship among Ec, yc, tensile strain rates and f were discussed.

The strength test of the weld joints is conducted by pulling the joint materials using INSTRON Series IX/s Automated <b>Materials</b> <b>Tester</b> System.

Drug concentration range was 0 %- 100 % (m/m) with 10 % intervals. The powder formulations were compacted to several relative densities with the Zwick <b>material</b> <b>tester.</b> The compaction force and tensile strength were fitted to several mathematical models that give representative factors for the powder compressibility. The factors k and C (Heckel and modified Heckel equation) showed mostly a nonlinear correlation with increasing drug load. The biggest drop in both factors occurred at far regions and drug load ranges. This outcome is crucial because in binary mixtures the drug load regions with higher changeover of plotted factors could be a hint for an existing percolation threshold. The susceptibility value (Leuenberger equation) showed varying values for each formulation without the expected trend of decrease for higher drug loads.

In a subgroup of 32 patients, the aortic valve orifice area was sufficient to carry out mechanical testing on a LFPlus Universal <b>material</b> <b>tester.</b> An in vitro removal of fructosamine of the valve was initiated using ATP-dependent fructosamine 3 -kinase (FN 3 K). RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the aortic valve fructosamine concentration and the calculated aortic valve orifice area: Y (aortic valve orifice area, mm 2) = 1. 050 - 0. 228 X (aortic valve fructosamine concentration, µmol/g valve) (r=- 0. 38). A significantly higher calcium concentration was measured in the aortic valves of diabetics in comparison with those of non-diabetics. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the presence of diabetes mellitus and aortic valve fructosamine concentration were the main predictors of the extensibility of the aortic valves. In the in vitro deglycation study, a significant lower aortic valve fructosamine concentration was detected after treatment with FN 3 K. This resulted in an increased flexibility of the aortic valves. CONCLUSIONS: Although no direct causativeness is proven with the presented results, which just show an association between fructosamine, the effect of FN 3 K and aortic valve stiffness, the present study points for the first time towards a possible additional role of the Amadori products in the biomechanical properties of ageing aortic valves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In an open surgery, {{identification}} of precise margins for curative tissue resection is performed by manual palpation. This {{is not the}} case for minimally invasive and robotic procedures, where tactile feedback is either distorted or not available. In this paper, we introduce the concept of intraoperative wireless tissue palpation. The wireless palpation probe (WPP) is a cylindrical device (15 mm in diameter, 60 mm in length) that can be deployed through a trocar incision and directly controlled by the surgeon to create a volumetric stiffness distribution map of the region of interest. This map can then be used to guide the tissue resection to minimize healthy tissue loss. The wireless operation prevents the need for a dedicated port and reduces the chance of instrument clashing in the operating field. The WPP is able to measure in real time the indentation pressure with a sensitivity of 34 Pa, the indentation depth with an accuracy of 0. 68 mm, and the probe position with a maximum error of 11. 3 mm in a tridimensional workspace. The WPP was assessed on the benchtop in detecting the local stiffness of two different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus ranging from 45 to 220 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below 5 %. Then, in vivo trials were aimed to identify an agar-gel lump injected into a porcine liver and to assess the device usability within the frame of a laparoscopic procedure. The stiffness map created intraoperatively by the WPP was compared with a map generated ex vivo by a standard uniaxial <b>material</b> <b>tester,</b> showing less than 8 % local stiffness error {{at the site of the}} lump.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) should ideally have {{mechanical properties}} {{similar to those}} of the bone tissue the material is used to replace or repair. Usually, the compressive strength of the CPCs is reported and, more rarely, the elastic modulus. Conversely, scarce or no data are available on Poisson's ratio and strain-to-crack-initiation. This is unfortunate, as data on the elastic response is key to, e. g., numerical model accuracy. In this study, the compressive behaviour of brushite, monetite and apatite cements was fully characterised. Measurement of the surface strains was done using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and compared to results obtained with the commonly used built-in displacement measurement of the <b>materials</b> <b>testers.</b> The collected data showed that the use of fixed compression platens, as opposed to spherically seated ones, may in some cases underestimate the compressive strength by up to 40 %. Also, the built-in measurements may underestimate the elastic modulus by up to 62 % as compared to DIC measurements. Using DIC, the brushite cement was found to be much stiffer (24. 3 ± 2. 3  GPa) than the apatite (13. 5 ± 1. 6  GPa) and monetite (7. 1 ± 1. 0  GPa) cements, and elastic moduli were inversely related to the porosity of the materials. Poisson's ratio was determined to be 0. 26 ± 0. 02 for brushite, 0. 21 ± 0. 02 for apatite and 0. 20 ± 0. 03 for monetite. All investigated CPCs showed low strain-to-crack-initiation (0. 17 – 0. 19 %). In summary, the elastic modulus of CPCs is substantially higher than previously reported and it is concluded that an accurate procedure is a prerequisite in order to properly compare the mechanical properties of different CPC formulations. It is recommended to use spherically seated platens and measuring the strain at a relevant resolution and on the specimen surface. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale racking testers were {{developed}} {{for use as}} a means to evaluate paperboard-based sheathing materials used in framed wall-construction. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of different sheathing <b>materials,</b> the <b>tester</b> provides an economic alternative to standard full-scale racking tests. In addition, results from testing provide practical insight into the racking response of framed and sheathed walls. The load-deformation responses of three commercial sheathing boards were measured, and initial racking stiffness and racking strength were proposed as parameters for characterizing the board. The racking test results showed that the initial paperboard racking stiffness correlated to elastic modulus and caliper, but the response was insensitive to paperboard orientation or test dimensions. Observations and results showed that both panel buckling and paperboard cutting at the staples affected the racking response, but the dominating factor influencing the racking response appears to be load transfer through the staples...|$|R
