5|$|Korn are {{identified}} as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music {{which began in the}} mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and industrial metal. Their debut album <b>mixed</b> <b>metal,</b> funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.|$|E

The IIIF, which first flew on 20 April 1926, had a more streamlined engine installation and initially a fuselage of <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> and wooden construction, with similar wings to the IIID, although later production aircraft were fitted with an all-metal fuselages and wings.|$|E
25|$|Industrial music {{comprises}} many {{styles of}} experimental music, including {{many forms of}} electronic music. The term was coined in the mid-1970s for Industrial Records artists. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production {{was not limited to}} music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Boyd Rice, SPK, and Z'EV. Test Dept, Clock DVA, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Laibach, and The Leather Nun subsequently participated in the movement. German group Einstürzende Neubauten forged their own style, which <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> percussion, guitars and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played.|$|E

Under present investigation, two indigenous aquatic plants P. stratiotes and E. crassipes were {{used to compare the}} removal of single <b>metal</b> Pb and <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> (Pb+Zn+Ni+Cd+Cr) from simulated wastewater. Both species were cultivated in simulated UMS Lake water by adding 0. 5 mg/L concentration of Pb as single metal and 0. 5 mg/L of <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> Pb, Zn, Ni, Cd and Cr in CVIF reactor for 15 days experimental period. The removal {{efficiency of}} single metal Pb has shown sharp decrease in the first and 2 nd day of the experiment with 94 %. On the contrary, <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> showed lag phase at day 6 of cultivation and continued to have gradual pattern until day 15. The final results showed that single metal Pb has been removed almost 100 % from the simulated wastewater as compared to the <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> which is only 72 %. The enrichment factor (EF), translocation factor (TF) and distribution of single and mixed Pb in plant tissues (roots, leaves and stalks) of P. stratiotes and E. crassipes were also discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between microstructure and hydrogenation {{properties of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> has been investigated via different spectroscopic techniques and the density functional theory (DFT). FESEM and TEM analyses demonstrated the nano-grains of Mg 2 NiH 4 and MgH 2 on the hydrogenated microstructure of the adsorbents that were confirmed by using XPS analysis technique. SAED pattern of hydrogenated metals attributed the polycrystalline nature of <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> and ensured the hydrogenation to Mg 2 NiH 4 and MgH 2 compounds. Flower-like rough surface of <b>mixed</b> <b>metals</b> showed high hydrogenation capacity.

500|$|Across the Atlantic, similar {{experiments}} were taking place. In San Francisco, performance artist Monte Cazazza began recording noise music. Boyd Rice released several albums of noise, with guitar drones and tape loops creating {{a cacophony of}} repetitive sounds. In Boston Sleep Chamber and other artists from [...] Inner-X-Musick began experimenting {{with a mixture of}} powerful noise and early forms of EBM. In Italy, work by Maurizio Bianchi {{at the beginning of the}} 1980s also shared this aesthetic. In Germany, Einstürzende Neubauten <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> percussion, guitars, and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played. Blixa Bargeld, inspired by Antonin Artaud and an enthusiasm for amphetamines, also originated an art movement called Die Genialen Dilettanten. Bargeld is particularly well known for his hissing scream.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} oxide of {{vanadium}}, vanadium pentoxide V2O5, {{is used as}} a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. Vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics. [...] Vanadium is an important component of <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein, acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. In service, the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture. [...] Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO2, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry, although alexandrite in nature is a chrysoberyl.|$|E
500|$|Like Jane's Addiction, many of {{the most}} popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the {{umbrella}} term [...] "alternative metal". Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a [...] "place for heavy metal in alternative rock", and Alice in Chains were {{at the center of the}} alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions). Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented [...] "the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dart first flew on 26 November 1963. [...] Four {{were entered}} into the National Gliding Competition in May 1964, but failed to impress in the light {{conditions}} of the first few days. [...] It became increasingly clear that {{the speed of the}} Dart could not compensate in typical English conditions for the high minimum sink rate resulting from its high wing loading of 5.6lb/sq ft (27.3kg/m2). [...] Since the 1965 World Championships were also scheduled for the UK, Slingsby decided to increase the wing area by stretching the span to 17 m, making the Dart an entrant for the Open Class. [...] Initially this version also had a wooden wing spar, but some distortion noticed when the airbrakes were extended led to a redesigned spar of <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> and wood construction. The new wing was also fitted with a trailing edge root extension and a 1ft (0.305 m) increase in aileron length and this version of the Dart became known as the Dart 17. The first Dart 17 used an undercarriage with a less extended wheel, fitted in a fairing but almost all later ones were fitted with a retracting undercarriage. [...] The later Dart 15s used a similar metal and wood spar and had the root fillet, producing a net weight saving of 45lb (21kg) and a corresponding improvement in sink rate. [...] Most Dart 15s retained the fixed wheel undercarriage to allow them to compete as Standard Class. [...] Darts with retractable gear gained an R in their designation, e.g. 17R.|$|E
