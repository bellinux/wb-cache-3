40|$|Introduction. Pleural {{mesothelioma}} with metastasis to the {{subcutaneous tissue}} of the abdominal wall at first diagnosis and without penetration into the peritoneum {{is an extremely}} rare clinical presentation. Methods. Patients with pleural mesothelioma have low survival rate. Usually, the disease at presentation is confined to its site of origin (most often the pleural cavity). A 55 -year-old man was referred to our center due to increasing dyspnea and a painful periumbilical mass in the anterior abdominal wall. CT scan revealed both advanced <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and a tumor mass confined to the subcutaneous fatty tissue without penetration through the peritoneum. Results. Video-assisted thoracoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid pleural mesothelioma, which was also confirmed by a biopsy of the periumbilical mass. Systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed was initiated. Under the ongoing systemic chemotherapy, the evaluation revealed partial remission of pleura mesothelioma and its subcutaneous manifestation of the abdominal wall. Conclusion. <b>Mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> with a simultaneous metastasis to the subcutaneous fatty tissue of the abdominal wall at presentation without penetration of peritoneum is a rare clinical presentation of mesothelioma disease. The knowledge of its natural history is very limited.

40|$|Summary From 1984 to 1989, 63 {{patients}} with diffuse, malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> {{were treated with}} 4 - 8 courses of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX, 3 g total dose) and citrovorum factor rescue. There were 61 male and two female patients of median age 60 years. CT scan was performed before and after treatment and used for response evaluation. Of 60 patients evaluable for response, 37 % showed partial or complete remission, 32 % showed no change and 32 % showed progressive disease. Median survival from start of treatment for all patients was 11 months, for 42 {{patients with}} the epithelial type 12 months, and for 20 patients with sarcomatous or mixed types only 5 months. Toxicity was acceptable, with only five patients (8 %) terminating therapy due to toxicity. One toxic death occurred. We conclude that HDMTX is an active regimen in malignant pleural mesothelioma. The significantly shorter survival for patients with the sarcomatous or mixed subtypes indicates that further investigations on the activity of HDMTX in mesothelioma {{should be limited to}} patients with the epithelial subtype. The outlook for patients with malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> is generally extremely poor, with median survival rates around 12 months or less (Alberts et al., 1988).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> (MM) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> or {{peritoneum}} is a universally fatal disease attracting {{an increasing}} range of medical interventions and escalating healthcare costs. Changes in survival and the factors affecting survival of all patients ever diagnosed with MM in Western Australia {{over the past}} five decades and confirmed by the Western Australian Mesothelioma Registry to December 2005 were examined. Sex, age, date and method of diagnosis, site of disease and histological type were recorded. Date of onset of symptoms and performance status were obtained from clinical notes for a sample of cases. Cox regression was used to examine <b>the</b> association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical variables and the 10 -yr periods of disease onset with survival after diagnosis. Survival was inversely related to age, being worse for males (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 1. 6), and those with peritoneal mesothelioma (HR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 1. 7). Patients with sarcomatoid histology had worse prognosis than patients with epithelioid and biphasic histological subtypes. Survival improved after the 1970 s and has made incremental improvements since then. Median (interquartile range) survival by decade, from 1960 until 2005, was 64 (0 – 198), 177 (48 – 350), 221 (97 – 504), 238 (108 – 502) and 301 (134 – 611) days;, 4 weeks of this apparent improvement can be attributed to earlier diagnosis.

40|$|Asbestos is {{the generic}} term for {{various types of}} natural silicates of {{magnesium}} and / or iron, which have fibrous forms. Due to its properties, asbestos has been widely used in industry, {{it is estimated that}} is present in approximately three thousand different products. It is currently known that asbestos causes, various types of diseases in exposed human beings, such as asbestosis, lung cancer and <b>mesothelioma</b> (cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> or peritoneum). Although <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> asbestos is already prohibited, its extended use in the past, requires the adequate surveillance in places where it is applied in order to reduce as much as possible <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> exposure to this agent. The Air and Occupational Health Unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Institute <b>of</b> Health Doutor. Ricardo Jorge (INSA) identifies since 1985, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> asbestos fibers in materials, using the Polarised Light Microscopy, method 9002 of NIOSH, Manual of analytical methods, fourth edition. Since its ban in 2005, by the Community Directive 2003 / 18 /EC, requests for such assessments have risen considerably (about 300 %) mainly in <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> air surveillance in schools. Requests for asbestos identification in materials, had a very significant increase since 2014, when the government undertook to carry out a survey of “materials suspected of containing asbestos” (MCA) in buildings, facilities and public facilities provided for in Law No. 2 / 2011 but, to date, it had not yet been made.

40|$|Malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> (MM) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} neoplasm whose incidence is increasing due to asbestos exposure. <b>The</b> capacity <b>of</b> asbestos to induce MM {{has been linked to}} its ability to cause <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> TNF-α that promotes mesothelial cells survival via NF-kB pathway leading to transcription of multiple pro-survival genes that promote tumor development. To date, there is no standard curative therapy for MM that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. As a consequence, more effective therapeutic strategies are needed for this fatal disease with the aim to identify new candidates for targeted therapies. Increasing evidence demonstrates that adenosine affects numerous pathophysiological processes including <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> cell death and proliferation. Adenosine interacts with four G-proteins coupled receptors named as A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3 adenosine receptors (ARs). A 1 and A 3 ARs inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and decrease cAMP production whilst A 2 A and A 2 BARs exert an increase of cAMP accumulation. It has been accepted that A 3 ARs are highly expressed in tumor cells showing a pivotal role in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> cancer. <b>The</b> primary aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to investigate}} <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> adenosine receptors (ARs) in human MM pleura (MMP) and healthy mesothelial pleura (HMP). To shed some light on the interaction between adenosine and MM, the presence and <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> ARs were explored in human healthy mesothelial cells (HMC) and in malignant mesothelioma cells (MMC). ARs were analyzed by using RT-PCR, Western blotting and saturation binding assays. HMC were treated with crocidolite asbestos which is the principal risk factor <b>of</b> MM. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> A 3 ARs on these cellular models, evaluating cAMP production, Akt phosphorylation and NF-kB activation was investigated. <b>The</b> dual effect <b>of</b> A 3 AR stimulation on healthy and cancer cell growth was studied by means of proliferation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, this is the first study reporting <b>the</b> up-regulation <b>of</b> A 3 AR in pleura from MM patients when compared with healthy pleura. A 3 AR mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased in MMC and in asbestos-treated HMC respect to untreated HMC. Furthermore, the A 3 AR agonist Cl-IB-MECA decreases proliferation and exerts cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effect on HMC exposed to asbestos and TNF-α and on tumoral MMC, but not in control HMC. These effects appear to be related to <b>the</b> de-regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Akt/NF-kB cell survival pathways contributing to the processes that lead to <b>the</b> malignant transformation <b>of</b> asbestos-exposed mesothelial cells. Taken together, these new findings suggest that A 3 AR could represent a possible target for pharmacological intervention to prevent mesothelial tumor development after asbestos exposure and to treat full blown MM...|$|R

There is also evidence that nonasbestos agents can induce malignant mesotheliomas. So, we need to study <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> exposure to asbestos in patients suffering from mesothelima to determine relationship between them in Iran, especially in occupational settings. Methods: We received <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> 272 <b>mesothelioma's</b> patients having been registered in 1385 to 1389 in Cancer Bureau, in Ministry of Health.

40|$|In our republic, {{occupational}} exposure to asbestos has been restricted to jobs concerned with disposal of products, materials and buildings containing asbestos, and research work studying asbestos fibres.

40|$|Metastatic or primary (<b>mesothelioma)</b> {{malignancy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> often generates major pleura] effusion, giving respiratory {{distress and}} low quality <b>of</b> life to <b>the</b> patients. Evacuation <b>of</b> fluid by thoracocentesis gives only temporary relief, therefore pleurodesis is generally regarded {{the best way}} to give palliation. <b>The</b> principle <b>of</b> pleurodesis is to cause a severe inflammation with desquamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesothelial cells, resulting in a fibrosis that obliterates the pleural space. <b>The</b> aims <b>of</b> this thesis were to study various aspects <b>of</b> chemical pleurodesis: <b>the</b> inflammatory response in <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and <b>the</b> systemic inflammatory reaction during such treatment and also to investigate if the reaction had predictive value on pleurodesis outcome; <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> pleurodesis on respiratory function; to compare the efficacy and side effects of two drugs used for pleurodesis; and the long-term survival after pleurodesis in different malignancies. It was found that the cytokine IL- 1 beta was present in the pleural fluid before and during chest tube drainage and increased after quinacrine instillation. However high concentrations of IL- 10 values after instillation were related to the need for longer treatment duration. Successful pleurodesis leads to fibrous adhesions between the lung and costal pleura, which might restrict lung mobility. Ten patients without radiological signs of tumour infiltration and without visible signs of tumour growth in the pleural space at thoracoscopy were investigated after pleurodesis with static and dynamic spirometry, exercise testing with blood gas determination, and radiospirometry. The study showed that pleurodesis in malignant pleurisy has very limited influence on respiratory function. Quinacrine has been used for pleurodesis with good results in our clinic for decades, and talc, which gradually during recent years become the most commonly used drug for this purpose world-wide. The comparative study between talc and quinacrine in 110 patients showed that both drugs were effective for pleurodesis. Fluid accumulation was stopped within six days in 96 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talc group and 89 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quinacrine group. All 89 prospective patients had verified malignant effusion. The markers investigated for the systemic inflammatory reaction were erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, and leukocyte count from venous blood samples, and fever reaction. Cessation of fluid accumulation was achieved in 82 patients (92 %) and all had a prominent transitional elevation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflammatory parameters. The unsuccessful attempts (8 %) caused negligible or very small elevations, but due to the small number, only <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> fever after 8 and 48 hours showed a statistically significant difference.

Altogether 197 patients with malignant effusion were discharged from our clinic between January 1, 1991 to September 30, 1994 after a successful pleurodesis. The four most common primary tumours were lung, breast, lymphoma and ovarian malignancies. The overall median survival from pleurodesis was 135 days.

40|$|SYNOPSIS The exfoliative {{cytology}} of 14 diffuse mesothelioma (11 pleural {{and three}} peritoneal) is described.

The present consensus of opinion is that diagnosis of diffuse <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and peritoneum by cytological examination of the pleural or ascitic fluid is difficult (Naylor, 1963; Koss, 1968). The Working Group on Asbestos and Cancer (Inter-national Union against Cancer, 1965) was {{of the opinion that}} only in a few cases was it possible to be confident of the diagnosis from cytology alone. Cytology can, however, be a guide to possible cases of mesothelioma (McCaughey, 1965) as it enables a provisional diagnosis to be suggested, to b...|$|E
40|$|A case of benign {{localized}} {{pleural mesothelioma}} is reported. The patient was a 30 -year-old female with no complaint. The mesothelioma {{was detected by}} routine chest radiography. The chest radiogram on admission revealed a mass located in the right middle-lower lung field adjacent to the lateral chest wall. Physical and laboratory examinations did not show any abnormality. Ultrasonography demonstarated a homogeneous mass between the chest wall and the lung. CT examination revealed a soft tissue mass adjacent to the chest wall having an extrapulmonary sign. A percutaneous needle biopsy was done. These examinations suggested that the mass was a slow growing pleural tumor. The patient underwent tumorectomy with partial resection of the right lung. The tumor was solid and approximately 4 cm in diameter and 1. 5 cm in thickness. It arose from the visceral pleura and was pendunculated. The histological diagnosis was of a benign localized fibrous <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura...</b>|$|E

40|$|Mesothelioma is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} primary tumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and usually associated with inhalation of asbestos fibers. In contrast, peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare entity whose pathomechanism is not yet fully understood. <b>The</b> coexistence <b>of</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> with secondary involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdominal cavity has not been addressed in the literature. In this case report, we describe secondary malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater omentum. A 69 -year-old man with histologically proven pleural mesothelioma on the right side and no past medical history of asbestos exposure received palliative treatment consisting of a talc pleurodesis. After a 6 -month interval of stable disease, a local progressive tumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>pleura</b> was seen on a CT scan. Eleven months later, during follow-up, the patient presented at our emergency department with a sudden onset of diffuse abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass within the greater omentum and <b>the</b> coexistence <b>of</b> free fluid. Subsequent abdominal CT scans demonstrated tumor infiltration from <b>the</b> right <b>pleura</b> by a transdiaphragmatic route into the abdomen, where diffuse infiltration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater omentum was observed. Aspiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ascites and <b>the</b> biopsy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater omentum confirmed <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> secondary malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peritoneum. In conclusion, we present the extremely rare diagnosis <b>of</b> secondary malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, which arose as a result of local progression from <b>the</b> right <b>pleura</b> into <b>the</b> abdomen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Malignant {{mesothelioma}} is {{an uncommon}} tumor <b>of</b> serosal surfaces. <b>The</b> most common sites <b>of</b> origin include <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and <b>the</b> peritoneum. Malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunica vaginalis testis is rare. We describe a 78 year-old {{man with a}} 2 -month history of a rapidly enlarging scrotum. The initial pathologic diagnosis was fibrous pseudotumor by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> cellular spindle cells and <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> dense fibrous tissue. However, further immunohistochemistry revealed characteristic features <b>of</b> desmoplastic variant <b>mesothelioma.</b> <b>Mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peritoneum and tunica vagi-nalis {{tends to be the}} epithelioid type. <b>The</b> purely desmoplastic-type <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunica vaginalis has never been reported.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the {{presence}} of fibrous asbestos particulates has been observed {{in a number of}} municipal water supplies throughout the USA, Canada, and several other regions all over the world. The possible health hazards which these fibers present have spurred a great deal of interest in the problems of detection and removal of the submicroscopic particulates in water. Asbestos is a group of fibrous metamorphic silicate minerals that is ubiquitous in the environment {{as a result of its}} extensive industrial use and the dissemination of fibers from natural sources. The health hazards associated with inhalation of asbestos in the occupational environment have long been recognized including asbestosis, bronchial carcinoma, malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and peritoneum, and possibly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and larynx. It is introduced into water by the dissolution of asbestos-containing minerals and ores, and from industrial effluents, atmospheric pollution and erosion of asbestos-cement (A/C) pipes in th...|$|E
40|$|The lungs from 36 past {{workers at}} an east London {{asbestos}} factory {{who had died}} from asbestos related disease were compared with lung tissue from 56 matched control patients being operated on in east London for carcinoma of the lung, correlating the severity of asbestosis {{and the presence of}} pulmonary carcinoma or <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> or peritoneum with an asbestos exposure index and type and amount of mineral fibre in the lungs. Asbestosis was associated with far heavier fibre burdens than mesothelioma. There was also a striking difference in the degree of asbestosis between the subjects with mesothelioma and those with carcinoma of the lung, the asbestosis being more severe in the latter. A further finding was that crocidolite and amosite were strongly associated with asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung complicating asbestosis, and mesothelioma, whereas no such correlation was evident with chrysotile or mullite. It is suggested that more emphasis should be placed on the biological differences between amphibole and serpentine asbestos fibre...|$|E
40|$|EPIDEMIOLOGICAL {{studies in}} man {{suggest that the}} risk of <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> and {{peritoneum}} is related to past exposure to asbestos dust, and that there may be differences with the type of fibre (Gilson, 1966). As these pleural mesotheliomas can be induced in animals by intra-pleural injection of the asbestos (Wagner, 1962; Smith et al., 1965; Roe et al., 1967) animal experiments may help to establish factors influencing the occurrence of these tumours, such as the type of fibre, the mechanism of access to the pleura and peritoneal surfaces, and the importance of particle size. A large scale intra-pleural injection experiment in specific pathogen-free and standard animals was started in November 1962. A preliminary report on the tumours arising in the SPF rats was given by Wagner in 1965. This included detailed descriptions of the material, methods and histological findings. At the Second International Congress on the Biological Effects of Asbestos held in Dresden in 1968, the results of both experiments were presented. In this paper, the statistical basis of these experiments and the results, are considered...|$|E

40|$|Although several {{immunohistochemical}} markers are available, {{differential diagnosis}} between mesothelioma and metastatic adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> is difficult. We {{have found that}} <b>the</b> immunoreactivity <b>of</b> manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an important antioxidant enzyme, is high in mesothelioma compared to healthy pleural mesothelium. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study was to}} investigate whether MnSOD can be used in <b>the</b> differential diagnosis <b>of</b> malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> and metastatic adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura.</b> MnSOD expression was assessed by using immunohistochemistry in biopsies <b>of</b> malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> (n = 35) and metastatic adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> (n = 21). MnSOD immunoreactivity was assessed semiquantitatively with and without microwave pretreatment. Fifteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 35 malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> showed moderate or strong MnSOD expression without and 23 with microwave pretreatment, the corresponding figures for metastatic adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleura</b> being 1 and 2 out of 21 (P = 0. 002 and P< 0. 001, respectively by Fisher's exact test). Only mesothelioma biopsies showed strong MnSOD reactivity, and it was never negative in <b>mesothelioma,</b> whereas one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adenocarcinomas showed no MnSOD reactivity.
