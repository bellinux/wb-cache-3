In addition, {{they found it}} <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, they thought {{that this type of}} game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading to the development of both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sieff, United Press International (December 25, 2001) — The great veteran actor Maury Chaykin {{was born}} to play Nero. And Timothy Hutton is equally perfect as his leg-man and always squabbling employee/amanuensis/Dr. Watson/Captain Hastings sidekick, Archie Goodwin. … Hutton, an Oscar winner, and Chaykin {{are at the heart}} of it all. They have done many prestigious things in their careers and no doubt will do many more. But it is clear they know they will never have <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> doing this.|$|E

[...] Allan Jeffreys of ABC said the actors were [...] "the most talented hippies you'll ever see... {{directed}} in a wonderfully wild fashion by Tom O'Horgan." [...] Leonard Probst of NBC said [...] "Hair is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it's <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> any other this season". [...] John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot's [...] "dynamic score" [...] that [...] "blasts and soars", and Len Harris of CBS said [...] "I've finally found the best musical of the Broadway season... it's that sloppy, vulgar, terrific tribal love rock musical Hair." ...|$|E

500|$|None of Ochs's songs became hits, {{although}} [...] "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends" [...] {{received a}} good deal of airplay. It reached #119 on Billboards national [...] "Hot Prospect" [...] listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which sarcastically suggested that [...] "smoking marijuana is <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> drinking beer". It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching #8 with her cover of Ochs's song [...] "There but for Fortune", which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for [...] "Best Folk Recording". In the U.S. it peaked at #50 on the Billboard charts—a good showing, but not a hit.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman {{gave the}} film a C– rating, praising Petty's {{performance}} {{which he said}} was the only good part of an otherwise [...] "amateurish" [...] film. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Janet Maslin gave moderately positive reviews, with Rosenbaum concluding: [...] "unless you're a preteen boy who hates girls, it's funnier and a lot <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> Batman Forever." [...] Maslin wrote: [...] "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy." [...] Leonard Klady from Variety gave a mixed review, saying: [...] "What's missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits. And Lori Petty as 'Tank Girl'... has the spunk but, sadly, not {{the heart of the}} post-apocalyptic heroine." ...|$|E
500|$|Dee {{was more}} positive, writing that he [...] "enjoyed it very much" [...] and that [...] "there were some lovely gags." [...] He noted, however, {{that he felt}} it took {{slightly}} too much time {{to set up the}} episode, though after the wife swap, [...] "it marched along." [...] The Times critic Dominic Maxwell thought the [...] "languid timing that Gervais brings to Extras and The Office was wrong here. Simpsons cameos are normally lean, but Gervais's shtick ran rampant through the second half, turning the regulars into extras." [...] Maxwell did find the episode entertaining though, stating that [...] "it was a decent late-period Simpsons episode" [...] and that it featured [...] "some fine jokes." [...] He concluded that [...] "even a middling Simpsons episode is still bright and tight and brilliantly rendered. So even if this one didn’t really work, it was still a lot <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> a lot of [...] that do." ...|$|E

[...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire." [...] Simon Hoggart, writing for The Spectator, commented that Davies's adaptation of Northanger Abbey [...] "was much bolder and more confident than Mansfield Park the week before." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Amy Ratcliffe rated [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] with a {{score of}} 7.5 out of 10, {{describing}} it as [...] "fun" [...] with [...] "not impressive but not horrible" [...] special effects and a story that was [...] "enjoyable and entertaining but not gripping." [...] Ratcliffe enjoyed the interactions between Emma and Regina, but commented that she [...] "could do with less of Regina's withering stares" [...] and [...] "precious apples." [...] She also found the change of music when switching to the fairy tale realm to be [...] "an unnecessary bat over the head." [...] Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A–. While she liked Bauer van Straten's performance, McLennan wished that her character had been [...] "fiercer" [...] in her first appearance. Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy thought it was <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the pilot and praised Morrison's [...] "tough-as-nails-but-with-a-secret-heart-of-gold" [...] performance, {{as well as her}} character's feud with Regina.|$|E
500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, a staff writer for The New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E

500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Fred Thomas of AllMusic complimented them for disposing of the introspective material which appeared on prior albums and choosing to [...] "accentuate all the throbbing rhythms, metallic guitars and bilious disgust that defined the band's best work." [...] He went on to suggest that Born Villain could pave the way for future releases. Reviewing for Classic Rock, Mick Farren – who was cynical of the hype the album was receiving – said [...] "to my delight as a closet fan, Born Villain turns out to be little short of excellent", praising its emphasis on [...] "bone-crunching rhythm". A review for Blabbermouth said that several tracks were likely to be considered classics among the band's discography. The Ottawa Sun complimented the album's lyrical themes, saying that it saw Manson [...] " [...] like the slasher-flick antihero he deserves to be." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy praised the album for being <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> previous work, while Gary Graff from Billboard applauded it for containing a wide variety of moods and styles.|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Richie Unterberger wrote the album [...] "It's {{perhaps a little}} <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to hear <b>than</b> the average early 1960s Jack Elliott album, because the live {{ambience}} and spoken introductions and asides give it a warmer atmosphere than the earnest but plain studio recordings." ...|$|R

During those early years the Stapes played <b>more</b> for <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> money. Crowds were small and player salaries averaged $10 per game.

500|$|John Walker from MTV News {{reviewed}} the opening concert in Fort Lauderdale, and {{was impressed with}} the show. He particularly liked the segment, when after the performance of [...] "Alejandro", Gaga decided to change her costume onstage and did so {{with the help of her}} stylists. Walker added that [...] "to prove this, [...] ripped the green, shoulder-length wig right off of her head. Yes, she literally snatched her own wig. Reverse Warholian expedition says what?" [...] Walker further emphasized in another review for MTV that the tour expanded on Gaga's characteristic [...] "fan-to-artist" [...] connections and theatrics she had developed with the Born This Way Ball. Adam Carlson from Billboard praised the show saying that it turned the [...] "spectacle" [...] into a [...] "surprise". He complimented the choreography and the constant costume changes, explaining that [...] "talking about [...] performances is <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> listening to them, but don't take that as an insult.

The video was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and begins with a scene of a man diving into the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc swimming pool and coming out of its edge, where {{a number of very}} lightly beachwear-clad people are sunbathing. Minogue stands out in a series of different zoom central shots lying on a sky-blue towel wearing a dark blue bodyhugging Balenciaga dress. The next scenes of the video capture her singing the song through different camera angles, particularly during the chorus when the camera angle shifts to a [...] "bird's eye" [...] view and show Minogue amid beach models performing synchronised choreography to the dance beats. A reviewer from District MTV commented that the video showed that [...] "synchronised sun bathing is <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> it sounds". Ben Taylor from Swide Magazine included the video in his list of Minogue’s [...] "Best Music Video Moments". Used for promoting the song, the video premiered earlier than the song's release date, on 21 October 2003. Minogue talked about the video, saying: ...|$|E

Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an [...] "A", and the latter explained: [...] "the {{arrangement}} ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel", and [...] "this nerdy white boy has himself some soul." [...] Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row [...] "is a tad boring". While most reviewers disliked [...] "Friday" [...] in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this—Gonzalez said she hated herself [...] "for giving this horrendously addictive version of a horrendous song a B." [...] VanDerWerff said the song was [...] "way, way, way too long, though it was <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> [...] expected it to be", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it [...] "darn good and infectious", and Mullins said it was [...] "much catchier than the original".
