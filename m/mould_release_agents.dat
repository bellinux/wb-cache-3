The type of mould release technology used, has a direct effect on the surface finish of the formation of fair faced concrete, and this in turn affects long term durability and surface finish. This paper examines two <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents,</b> one permeable formwork liner and Type 1 polypropylene fibres used with a single mould release agent. Cubes were cast in film faced plywood moulds using a C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents.</b> The range of variables tested comprised of, two (FS and CL) commercially available solvent based <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> (MRA), permeable formwork and C 1 used with polypropylene fibres. The results showed that the controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liner produced the fewest blowholes and was the best performing technology used in that respect. As a consequence of this, CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, however the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring...|$|E

40|$|PhDKissing bonds (KBs) {{refer to}} the {{situation}} where two surfaces are only partially bonded or are debonded but touching or in very close proximity. This may be the consequence of poor adhesion, environmental degradation or impact damage. This defect is not visible macroscopically and because of their intimate contact which {{makes it more difficult}} to detect using a non destructive technique (NDT) than conventional defects such as voids or cracks etc. The success of NDT evaluation and widespread use of adhesive bonding rely greatly upon comprehensive knowledge of morphology, surface chemistry and mechanics associated with KBs. Two approaches were successfully taken to produce reliable and repeatable KBs: by surface contamination using a <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> (FrekoteÂ® 700 -NC); and by weakening the electrically-debonding adhesive, ElectReleaseâ 8 ̆ 4 ¢, with a low voltage. Significant changes in morphology and elemental distribution of the contaminant at/near the Frekote contaminated interfaces were found. Some morphological and chemical changes at/near the anodic metal/ElectReleaseâ 8 ̆ 4 ¢ interface were also evident. Additional information about chemical interactions at/or near the contaminated interface due to the presence of Frekote and the application of the electric field confirmed the changes in morphology and elemental distribution. Double-lap joints with KBs were tested in tension with local strains captured by strain gauges and extensometer. Significant reduction in failure strength was apparent when using Frekote and ElectReleaseâ 8 ̆ 4 ¢ subjected to the electric field. The tests were simulated using finite element analysis. Cohesive elements were introduced along the predicted failure interfaces taking into account the adhesion loss associated with KBs. The experimental failure load and local strain results were in good agreement with the finite element predictions. The ways that KBs were produced and the understandings in morphology, surface chemistry and their failure mechanisms contributed to the modified criteria of KBs and the development of the non-linear ultrasonic technique investigated by the NDT group at the University of Bristol.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive and renewable energy generation, has driven {{a need for a}} greater understanding of the fracture behaviour of bonded composite joints. An important prerequisite for the adhesive bonding of composites is the existence of a uniform surface free from contaminants and <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents.</b> While there are several ways in which this may be achieved, the use of peel plies has emerged as the preferred choice for many industries due to the repeatable nature of the resulting surface, particularly in the highly regulated aerospace industry. The use of peel plies can present some problems. It is possible that contamination from the peel ply can be transferred to the composite substrate and adversely affect the adhesive joint [1]. Plasma treatments have been shown to improve the fracture toughness of adhesively bonded composite joints [2] and can be used to remove contaminants, such as <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents,</b> from the surface [3]. The aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of various peel ply treatments on the mode I fracture toughness of different aerospace grade bonded composite joints and to assess the subsequent benefits of employing an atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) surface treatment prior to adhesive bonding in each case...|$|E

Composite joints are typically evaluated using lap shear type tests. While these tests are relatively simple to perform and post-process compared to their fracture mechanics based counterparts, the results can often be misleading and are greatly dependent on the overlap length, the thickness of the substrate and the type of fillet employed [2, 3]. The aim of this work is to show that composite joint systems can be modelled using material properties determined from fracture mechanics based tests. The fracture parameters will be used to develop numerical models of the fracture tests that accurately predict the wide-area lapshear test...|$|E

The type of mould release technology used has a direct effect on the surface finish of fair-faced concrete, and this in turn affects long-term durability. This work examined two <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> (MRAs), one permeable formwork liner and a type 1 polypropylene fibre concrete combined with a single MRA. Cubes were cast in film-faced plywood moulds using C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the MRAs.

The release agents used are commercially available as reactive-based MRAs. In addition, controlled permeability formwork (CPF) and a concrete mix with polypropylene fibre additions were used. The pilot study results showed that the CPF liner produced the least number of blowholes and, in that respect, was the best performing technology used. Consequently, the CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long-term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, but the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring. Two of the best performing mould release products (CPF and FS) were then tested using a high-resolution optical measurement system and the initial results were examined in much greater detail, taking account of surface roughness, pore volume and pore size. The CPF proved to produce a better finish than the FS release agent...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to substitute wet chemical mould coatings in the plastic and rubber processing by PVD and CVD coatings. Suitable mould coatings should show good demoulding characteristics, a positive wear-resistance and advantageous corrosion attributes. To judge the demoulding performance, trials with laboratory moulds were made and a demoulding device was built, enabling you to measure demoulding forces directly. PVD and CVD coatings showed reduced (up to 20 - 25 %) demoulding forces compared with uncoated and galvanic chrome coated moulds. The influence of <b>mould</b> <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are significantly stronger than the influence of different mould coatings. Due to the 2 to 4 times (TiC) higher micro hardness (Vickershardness) of PVD and CVD coatings compared with hardened steal and galvanic chrome, a higher wear-resistance of the moulds had been achieved. This helps against abrasive parts of the rubber formulation and abrasive mould cleaning. A higher corrosion resistance of some CVD and PVD coatings had been proved by extensive laboratory trials and corrosion tests as well as long term production use. CVD coatings and multilayers with CVD basic coatings are clearly more corrosion resistant than galvanic chrome coatings. It was proved during the project that PVD and CVD coatings can substitute the use of wet chemical galvanic chrome mould coating. (orig.)

40|$|Composition for {{coatings}} {{that are}} resistant to high temperatures, and are converted to ceramics by pyrolysis, contains 35 - 60, preferably 40 - 50 wt. % embedded inorganic fillers, embedded in an elastomer matrix of the dimethylsiloxane or polyurethane group. The fillers comprise 1 - 8, preferably 3 - 5 wt. % silicon carbide (SiC) with an average particle size of 1 - 15, preferably 1 - 5 mu m, 20 - 50, preferably 30 - 45 wt. % amorphous silicon dioxide (SiO 2) with an average particle size of 2 - 50, preferably 5 - 15 mu m and 0. 5 - 5. 0 wt. % highly disperse, hydrophilic metal oxides selected from SiO 2, titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) with an average particle size of 0. 01 - 2. 0 mu m and also 0. 5 - 6 wt. % carbon, ceramic and/or silicate fibres with an average length of 0. 5 - 10, preferably 1 - 5 mm.

30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the cured parts, <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Methedrone induces the {{transportation}} mediated release of NE, DA and 5-HT from cells preloaded with monoamines {{making it a}} serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine (SNDRA) <b>releasing</b> <b>agent,</b> also known as triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), which is a common characteristic among drugs of abuse.|$|R
30|$|Within this equation, all {{parameters}} which {{increase the}} <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with an enlarged value (time and pressure) are {{inserted in the}} numerator, while the parameters which decrease the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with higher value are inserted in the denominator.|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{characteristics}} of the raw materials (e.g. <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> formulation, resin formulation or fillers), the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer is depending on the processing during the crosslinking reaction of the resin. This dependency is subsequently discussed to identify the different influences.|$|R
50|$|In the {{concrete}} construction industry, form <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually plywood, overlaid plywood, steel or aluminum. In this application, {{there are two}} types of <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> available: barrier and reactive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Release</b> <b>agents</b> {{provide the}} {{critical}} barrier between a molding {{surface and the}} substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the vapor}} {{pressure}} of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> could also be relevant, if silicone oils are parts of the applied <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> At higher temperatures, those silicone oils have a relatively low vapor pressure [32], which could be critical for the CFRP-processing and would may be indicate a negative effect of an applied vacuum on the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer. Nevertheless, even if the vapor pressure is reached during the production cycle, the volatile components of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> are mainly sucked outside of the laminate by the applied vacuum system within the experimental set-up (e.g. by the application of vacuum bags [27, 33]), proven by the reduction of voids after the application of an higher vacuum [13].|$|R
50|$|A serotonin-norepinephrine-{{dopamine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SNDRA), {{also known}} as a triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), is a type of drug which induces the release of serotonin, norepinephrine/epinephrine, and dopamine in the brain and body. SNDRAs produce euphoriant, entactogen, and psychostimulant effects, and are almost exclusively encountered as recreational drugs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SRA) {{is a type}} of {{drug that}} induces the release of serotonin into the neuronal synaptic cleft. A selective serotonin <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SSRA) is an SRA with less significant or no efficacy in producing neurotransmitter [...] at other types of monoamine neurons.|$|R
30|$|Applying the NDT {{technologies}} Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) and Aerosol-Wetting-Test (AWT) {{was achieved}} using the CFRP samples without further preparation before characterising their surfaces. Comparing the OSEE signal intensity with {{the concentration of}} silicon atoms as detected by XPS, the experimental data shown in Figure  10 clearly reveal that the signals obtained in OSEE studies {{are sensitive to the}} presence of even the thinnest layers of <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> investigated. Additionally, results from evaluating sizes of water droplets obtained from performing the AWT for CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> and contaminated with distinct amounts of <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> respectively, are shown in Figure  10. For all the samples the same amount of water was applied, and the lateral dimensions and areas of imaged water drops show a size distribution. Basically, the portion of wider drops is observed to be significantly higher for the CFRP surface free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> which shows a better wettability with water as compared to the CFRP sample contaminated with <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> The elaborate studies comprising a variation of the surface concentration of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> reveal that even at the lowest investigated thickness of the silicone-based films the average size of water drops is significantly smaller than in case of the CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> That means that both OSEE and AWT investigations of CFRP adherents allow for clearly indicating the presence of a silicone-based <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> in an amount which – following Figure  1 – was demonstrated by Markatos et al. [23] to result in a strongly reduced strength of adhesive joints manufactured based on such adherents. These adherents therefore may be considered effectively contaminated. Cleaning them appropriately and testing the effect of the cleaning applying extended non-destructive testing will contribute to preventing the manufacture of adhesive joints with undesirably compromised strength.|$|R
