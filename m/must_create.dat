5|$|Yubaba {{has many}} {{similarities}} to The Coachman from Pinocchio, {{in the sense}} that she transforms humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were transformed into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a new identity.|$|E
5|$|The Castle Doctrine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} puzzle, strategy, stealth, and roguelike games, viewed from a 2D perspective. It focuses on maintaining and protecting a vault of money stored in one's house from intruders. These intruders are actually other {{players of the}} game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money—presented in a list rather than found through exploration—in the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, how many others have tried to rob it, and how many {{have died in the}} process. All deaths in the game are permanent; upon dying, the player <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a new character.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He <b>must</b> <b>create</b> creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an {{edutainment}} {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a profile, after which Brain Age Check runs three random {{tests to determine}} the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player's test performance. The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} limitation for HDR {{photography is}} that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterwards. Also, as one <b>must</b> <b>create</b> several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired luminance range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, {{but the use of}} a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.|$|E
25|$|Clean {{water is}} {{essential}} for hygiene, for consumption and for feeding programmes (for mixing with powdered therapeutic milk or porridge), {{as well as for}} preventing the spread of water-borne disease. As such, MSF water engineers and volunteers <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a source of clean water. This is usually achieved by modifying an existing water well, by digging a new well and/or starting a water treatment project to obtain clean water for a population. Water treatment in these situations may consist of storage sedimentation, filtration and/or chlorination depending on available resources.|$|E
25|$|Middle-class {{families}} have certain class-specific problems that arise when family and work intersects. Many {{of them have}} to do with the balance parents <b>must</b> <b>create</b> between their career aspirations and their familial desires. Because the middle class has greater access to more stable occupations and the chances for occupational mobility, many middle class American families must deal with the ultimate decision between balancing their families with their jobs. Although the figures vary depending on parents' household income, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates families spend anywhere from $134,370 to $269,520 raising a child from birth through age 17.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} work {{required}} to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically from a source such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer {{may be able to}} manually create a filter graph from a source file, possibly {{with the addition of a}} custom filter, and then let DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer must build the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a custom filter before a filter graph can be built.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005, Speakeasy Comics put {{out their}} sequel, The Living and the Dead, written by Todd Livingston and Robert Tinnell, with art by Micah Farritor. In it, Victor, now calling himself Hans, <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a new body {{for his first}} cousin who wants her syphilitic son to remain alive after a vicious beating, and she coerces {{him to do so}} under fear of exposing him for who he really is. Half-crazed due to the disease, the newly born monster {{proceeds}} to start a Grand Guignol theater in Ingolstadt until Victor puts him down {{with the help of the}} first monster he ever created. As thanks, Victor begins work on the last attempt he will make at playing God, and begins to build the original creature a mate.|$|E
25|$|Small Group Housing (SGH) is {{an option}} for juniors and seniors on Goshen's campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH offers {{students}} the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group <b>must</b> <b>create</b> a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations. Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.|$|E

500|$|Blake, in {{his notes}} to A Vision of the Last Judgement, {{describes}} how his design is to work: [...] "If the Spectator could Enter into these Images in his Imagination approaching {{them on the}} Fiery Chariot of his Contemplative Thought [...] then would he arise from his Grave". He relies on the word representation frequently in the work, and he tries to represent action in a visible manner that distances his depiction of the apocalypse from a traditional version that disguises the various components of an apocalyptic vision. To Blake, he <b>must</b> <b>create</b> {{an image of the}} Last Judgement, then represent the image, and then describe with a written gloss of the work. This creates a layer of representation that separates the audience from the apocalyptic experience, which undermines the concept of apocalypse as both mysterious and directly experienced.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the book's publication, the novelist J. B. Priestley, in a long essay in the New Statesman {{entitled}} [...] "What Was Wrong With Pinfold", offered the theory that Waugh had been driven to the verge of madness not by an unfortunate cocktail of drugs but by his inability to reconcile his role as a writer with his desire to be a country squire. He concluded: [...] "Pinfold [...] must step out of his role as the Cotswold gentleman quietly regretting the Reform Bill of 1832, and if he cannot discover an accepted role as English man of letters... he <b>must</b> <b>create</b> one." [...] Waugh replied mockingly, drawing attention to Priestley's large land-holdings and surmising that [...] "what gets Mr Priestley's goat (supposing that he allows such a deleterious animal in his lush pastures) is my attempt to behave as a gentleman".|$|E
500|$|The Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF) is an {{umbrella}} group of pro-communist movements. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the VFF {{and its members}} constitute [...] "the political base of people's power".

[...] The VFF is governed on the principles of [...] "democratic consensus, coordinated and united action." [...] Its organisation has been modelled after the state structure, and the VFF has its own independent statute. Notable member organisations of the VFF include the General Confederation of Labour, the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union and the Veteran Association, among others.|$|E

500|$|Monteux {{wished to}} {{continue}} his work in helping young conductors: [...] "Conducting is not enough. I <b>must</b> <b>create</b> something. I am not a composer, so I will create fine young musicians." [...] In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to Igor Markevitch; later private students included André Previn, Seiji Ozawa, José Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him [...] "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, {{and there was nothing}} about conducting he didn't know." [...] After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, [...] "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... So did I. Next time don't interfere with them." [...] Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the Pierre Monteux School for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and Emanuel Leplin.|$|E
500|$|Bohemia Interactive prides {{themselves}} on open communication with players. The company laid out road maps {{in an effort}} to offer details on some of their post-release content, such {{as in the case of}} ARMA 3 and DayZ. The company also sometimes let players to help out with game design process. It invited players to the Czech studio to help with the design of the first Operation Flashpoint, and released several titles via early access, a way in which early build of a game is released for the community to test and play. Many of Bohemia Interactive games are moddable, a focus since the release of the ARMA: Armed Assault. The company awarded players who create user-generated content with their games in 2009 during the BIS Community Awards and announced a modding competition called [...] "Make Arma Not War", in which modders <b>must</b> <b>create</b> mods that shift ARMA focus from war into anything else. Bohemia Interactive also took a stance against pirating with their DEGRADE technology, which would automatically create technical issues to pirated copies. For instance, in Take On Heliciopters, pirated copies' visuals would be extremely blurry, whereas copies bought legitimately would not suffer from the same issue. The team also bought a T-72 tank in order to express gratitude, stating: [...] "A massive tanks goes out to everyone who has supported the studio and its games throughout the past 16 years".|$|E
500|$|... d [...] The {{propaganda}} line of Jewish Bolshevism {{was used}} intensively by Nazis in instigating antisemitic feelings among Lithuanians. It built upon the pre-invasion antisemitic propaganda of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian Activist Front which had seized upon {{the fact that}} more Jews than Lithuanians supported the Soviet regime. This had helped to create an entire mythos of Jewish culpability for the sufferings of Lithuania under the Soviet regime (and beyond). A LAF pamphlet read: [...] "For the ideological maturation of the Lithuanian nation it is essential that anticommunist and anti-Jewish action be strengthened [...] It is very important that this opportunity be used {{to get rid of the}} Jews as well. We <b>must</b> <b>create</b> an atmosphere that is so stifling for the Jews that not a single Jew will think that he will have even the most minimal rights or possibility of life in the new Lithuania. Our goal is to drive out the Jews along with the Red Russians. [...] The hospitality extended to the Jews by Vytautas the Great is hereby revoked for all time because of their repeated betrayals of the Lithuanian nation to its oppressors." [...] An extreme faction of the supporters of Augustinas Voldemaras, a group which also worked within the LAF, actually envisioned a racially exclusive [...] "Aryan" [...] Lithuanian state. With the start of German occupation, one of Kaunas' newspapers – Į Laisvę (Towards Freedom), commenced a spirited antisemitic crusade, reinforcing the identity of the Jew with communism in popular consciousness: [...] "Jewry and Bolshevism are one, parts of an indivisible entity." ...|$|E
