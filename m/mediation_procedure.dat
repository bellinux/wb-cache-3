It has developed a <b>mediation</b> <b>procedure,</b> getting the debtor and his creditors more involved in the reorganization process through direct negotiations between them, keeping the level of involvement by courts and trustees at a minimum, and providing incentives (e.g., less penalties, easier settlement) for debtors who are aware that they can no longer pay their debts as a way of encouraging early action. [...] Experience has not been very satisfactory until now, because of the banks' reluctance to co-operate and provide companies with an opportunity to restructure. A serious technical impediment to the framework enabling a greater number of enterprises to restructure in a timely fashion is the bankruptcy test or [...] "cessation of payments" [...] which, if proved before the court, triggers bankruptcy.

A task-based course was developed, which took into account national and institutional education policies regarding the development of business-related knowledge and skills and the limited English proficiency {{and knowledge of the}} business world possessed by the learners. Three core tasks, namely Describing Company Profiles, Describing Products, and Describing Trends were designed utilising Willis’ framework (Willis, 1996). The course was delivered over the course of six sessions to two groups of students (n = 22 and 25 respectively). Mixed methods data collection techniques were employed to examine 1) the appropriateness of the designed tasks, 2) the effectiveness of TBLT, 3) the effectiveness of <b>mediation</b> <b>procedures</b> integrated in task implementation and 4) suggestions for the improvement of tasks, TBLT and mediation practices. The data was collected through pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, observer and student interviews, research journals, class observation notes, and audio and video recording of class interactions from four observers and the two groups of students mentioned above. The qualitative analysis of data focused on participant perceptions of TBLT and mediation as well as on participant recommendations. The findings indicate both positive feedback and the existence of a number of critical issues. Participants were generally satisfied {{with the use of a}} wide range of materials and the usefulness of course content. The most significant participant concerns were related to teaching and learning conditions, content relevance and coverage, task complexity and difficulty, task materials, language focus (i. e. vocabulary and grammar teaching), peer feedback and teacher feedback, peer engagement as well as teacher mediation. Implications are also discussed, particularly the greater incorporation of explicit grammar teaching and the increase in number of teaching hours to allow for individual presentation practice and mediation on linguistic difficulties. ...|$|R

40|$|Research {{involving}} Hofstede’s (1980) power-distance variable {{suggests that}} low power-distance participants emphasise procedural justice considerations in fairness evaluations, whereas high power-distance participants emphasise distributive justice concerns. Since power-distance tends to vary across cultures, this represents {{an important consideration}} in the way participants from different cultural backgrounds respond to mediation procedures. It {{has been found that}} perceived bias in an evaluative <b>mediation</b> <b>procedure</b> leads to a qualitative change in the way low power-distance participants assess that procedure.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a comprehensive review}} of research on the issue of procedural justice in dispute resolution procedures, with a particular focus on mediation. The review traces the history of the literature from the early control models of Thibaut and Walker (1975), through to the modem relational model postulated by Lind and Tyler (1992 - 1998). It discusses the major theoretical models of procedural justice in terms of their implications for legal dispute resolution and focuses on <b>mediation</b> <b>procedures</b> used by the civil courts. The models provide a theoretical base for identifying which psychological processes, namely non-instrumental, instrumental or relational, operate in influencing litigant satisfaction with civil court mediation. The models also help explain litigants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the fairness of mediation and their satisfaction with it as an 2 ̆ 2 alternative 2 ̆ 2 dispute resolution procedure. Recent research has established that instrumental processes (those processes that revolve around issues relating to outcomes) and non-instrumental processes (those that incorporate the relational concerns and relate to issues of group membership and self-identity) are significant predictors of perceptions of procedural justice. Results from a field study of 103 litigants involved in pre-trial mediation conferences confirmed this, and further suggested that the non-instrumental concerns of voice and status recognition shape litigants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of procedural justice {{to a greater extent than}} the perceptions of mediator neutrality and trust. The design of the study also permitted an examination of group differences. Contrary to expectation, in the group of litigants who had not yet settled, distributive justice proved to be a better predictor of litigant satisfaction than procedural justice.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} {{approaches to the}} analysis of conflict situations and ways of developing <b>mediation</b> or negotiation <b>procedures.</b> In general, we can distinguish between socio-political approaches, <b>procedures</b> for <b>mediation</b> and negotiation which have developed historically through political experience, and systems-analytical, mathematical approaches, which rely on various branches of decision and game theory or on computerized simulation or gaming models. While the socio-political approaches must remain the basis of any analysis of conflict situations, they can usefully be supplemented by more-formalized approaches; both approaches, when used separately, have their limitations. This paper, after a short review of existing systems-analytical and mathematical approaches, proposes new concepts and methods for the mathematical analysis of conflict processes. The proposed approach attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} simulation gaming models and experiments and more formal game-theoretical analysis by taking certain ideas from interactive decision supported gaming, assuming that the players have multiple objectives that they wish to satisfice (not optimize), and introducing special <b>mediation</b> <b>procedures</b> as an element of decision support during the game.
