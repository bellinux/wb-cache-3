25|$|Renewable {{bushings}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> {{in their}} liner bushing, otherwise the tool can {{cause it to}} spin, which rapidly wears out the liner, or chips can force the bushing out of the liner. There are {{many different types of}} locking systems for renewable bushings. One system is a dog, which is a collar that is pressed over the head of the bushing and has a long tail. The tail may be bent at the end so it can lock {{around the edge of the}} jig plate or it may be left straight if it can butt up against another object. Another option to keep the renewable bushing from rotating is to pin it, either by putting a pin in the renewable bushing and a hole in the liner or vice versa. A more complicated version uses a hole in the bushing collar and a pin with a head; the head on the pin holds the edge of the collar down, but for removal the bushing can be rotated so that the hole lines up with the pin.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} 1988 that South Africa agreed to {{implement}} the resolution, signing the Tripartite Accord (an agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa) at UN headquarters in New York City. The accord recommended that 1 April 1989 be set as the date for implementation of Resolution 435, and was affirmed by the Security Council on 16 January 1989. As Hearn noted, [...] "The first characteristic of peacekeeping is that {{the consent of the}} disputants <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> before a force is deployed". With the accord in place (principally with South Africa), UNTAG was then formally established in accordance with Resolution 632 on 16 February 1989.|$|E

2500|$|As amended, Article 3, Section 1 {{expresses the}} [...] "firm will" [...] of the Irish nation {{to create a}} united Irish people, though not, explicitly, a united country. It stresses, however, that a united Ireland should respect the {{distinct}} cultural identity of Unionists and that it should only come about with the separate [...] "democratically expressed" [...] consent of the peoples of both parts of the island. This provision was intended to diminish the concerns of Unionists, that their rights would be ignored in a united Ireland, should that happen. Under the Good Friday Agreement the people of Northern Ireland's [...] "democratically expressed" [...] consent <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> in a referendum. Interestingly for a provision that speaks of the [...] "Irish Nation"'s desire for unity, it adds an additional legal requirement for a referendum to be held not only in Northern Ireland {{but also in the}} Republic of Ireland before a united Ireland could be brought about. This has the effect of creating an extra hurdle to Irish acceptance of a cession of Northern Ireland's territory from the UK which would not apply to a cession of any other territory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, most {{considered}} American Indians a primitive, even savage, people with limited intelligence. Many Indian observers feared the race would become extinct. McKenzie called upon {{the federal government}} to release Indians from federal control, abolish the reservation system, close the Bureau of Indian Affairs, grant all Indians full citizenship, open the U.S. Court of Claims to all tribes and bands and create a higher education system to cultivate American Indian leadership. McKenzie criticized federal policy granting Indians living on reservations rations and creating dependency; tribal controls that inhibited individuals from assimilation; and the [...] "wrong kinds of whites", including Congressman, merchants, saloon-keepers and land swindlers who created mistrust toward all white people. With the government in control of Indian affairs, and control of government a matter of the consent of majorities, McKenzie asserted, [...] "It is obvious that the administrative interests <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> privately by the people of intelligence and conscience in the white race." [...] "The Indian that does not have the numbers which will enable him to force his rights through the ballot box. His strength and his power will come through his intelligence." [...] McKenzie called upon American Indians to form the first national pan-tribal organization run by and for Indians, and not a [...] "friends of Indians" [...] organization such as the progressive Indian Rights Association.|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} of the European Council Donald Tusk has said that Nord Stream 2 {{is not in the}} EU's interests. [...] Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have questioned the different treatment of Nord Stream II and South Stream projects. [...] The project is considered to violate the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies. [...] A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, has been sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the Nord Stream 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the energy transmission assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU also criticized the project in July 2016. Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targetting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe. Although construction has started on Nord Stream 2, the government of Denmark wants to have its foreign ministry prevent it being routed through Danish waters, and a bill is proposed to go through Parliament in October 2017, giving the foreign ministry the ability to do this on foreign policy grounds. Supporters of the pipeline, including Germany, believe that unlawful deferrence has been made to US wishes of the project not proceeding.|$|E
