No matter what choices Alex has <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island.

If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
