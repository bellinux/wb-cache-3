The great oppression and misery of the people seem to grow rather than abate. The following extracts are from Consul Thesiger's report of his experiences in the Kasai Company's district. This company, it may be worth remarking, has paid the enormous dividend of seven hundred per cent.

Sophia Listriani, S. H., L. LM. For six years, the {{conflict}} in Syria has since evolved into a larger and more complex war. The annual report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict show that children {{are one of the}} main victim of killing and maiming in Syria. Millions of children are killed by armed conflict and many of them caused by the use of indiscriminate attack, explosive weapon and chemical weapon that all which are prohibited under international humanitarian law as mentioned in common article 3 of Geneva Conventions which is universally applicable at all times both International Armed Conflict and Non International Armed Conflict. The focus of the research is to describe the protection of children covered by International Humanitarian Law and to describe the measures of Syrian Government and United Nations to protect the children in armed conflict. This research is conducted under normative method. The data is accumulated predominantly on secondary data beside primary and tertiary data by library research through identifying and locating sources that provide actual information or opinion of legal experts. All parties to the armed conflict are bound by the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law. Those matters oblige the parties of the Conflict in Syria to give full protection to the children from the effects of armed conflict. Despite Syria has not signed the 1977 Additional Protocol II yet, Common article 3 of Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol II become applicable automatically when the requirements for an armed conflict are reached. The Protection Children in armed conflict under international humanitarian law is granted as civilians or combatants. The protection of children as civilian and combatans are enacted in Common Article 3 of Geneva Convention 1949, Additional protocol I and Additional protocol II 1997 to the Geneva Conventions. Syrian Government provides the preventive measures in the Law No. 11 of 2013 about the prohibition of recruitment and use of the {{children under the age of}} 18 by armed forces and armed groups. The thesis found that one of the biggest problems is the ICC can not apply its jurisdiction because Syria has not ratified the Rome Statute yet. Furthermore, United Nations established The Resposibility to Protect (R 2 P) norm as a part of use of force or humanitarian intervention mechanism to achieve a peaceful resolution to {{the conflict}} in Syria. The Government efforts are the key solution on the enforcement issue and United Nations shall review the usefulness of the veto to end the violence so that the situation in Syria can be tried either by national courts or ICC where the allegation can be prosecuted...|$|R

On 29 June, two horses were mutilated. Following this, the seventh attack, Campbell felt sure that Edalji was responsible for the <b>maimings,</b> because he reportedly had been seen late on that night in the field where it took place.|$|E

5000|$|Internet joking {{forces a}} re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They {{are no longer}} only defined by {{physical}} presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace. [...] "The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with". This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, [...] "that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event … flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh <b>maimings</b> and new collective tragedies". This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an [...] "active folkloric space" [...] with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.|$|E
50|$|Conan Doyle {{became an}} active investigator, {{going to the}} crime scenes, {{interviewing}} participants, and critiquing {{the reliability of the}} witness who testified that peculiarities found in the handwriting of Edalji also occurred in the 1903 pseudonymous 'Greatorex' letters to police, which named Edalji as a culprit in the animal mutilations. Legal technicalities made the evidence controversial concerning the letters being used to convict Edalji, because he was not tried on the charge of sending a threatening letter. Opinion within the Home Office was split on the matter. Conan Doyle thought that he had identified the person as a certain Royden Sharp who was behind the pseudonymous letters of 1892 and 1903 and the <b>maimings.</b> There have been a variety of opinions since about whether he was justified in his belief, although Peter Costello wrote a modern book on Conan Doyle's investigations and concurred with his conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|La Violencia did not acquire {{its name}} {{simply because of}} the number of people it affected; it was the manner in which most of the killings, <b>maimings,</b> and dismemberings were done. Certain death and torture {{techniques}} became so commonplace that they were given names—for example, picar para tamal, which involved slowly cutting up a living persons body; or bocachiquiar, where hundreds of small punctures were made until the victim slowly bled to death. Former Senior Director of International Economic Affairs for the United States National Security Council and current President of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, Norman A. Bailey describes the atrocities succinctly: [...] "Ingenious forms of quartering and beheading were invented and given such names as the corte de mica, corte de corbata (aka Colombian necktie), and so on. Crucifixions and hangings were commonplace, political prisoners were thrown from airplanes in flight, infants were bayoneted, schoolgirls, some as young as eight years old, were raped en masse, unborn infants were removed by crude Caesarian section and replaced by roosters, ears were cut off, scalps removed, and so on." [...] While scholars, historians, and analysts have all debated the source of this era of unrest, they have yet to formulate a widely accepted explanation for why it escalated to the notable level it did.|$|E

Dr. Henry Mansell, of the General Missionary Society, {{and returned with}} him to the Northwest Provinces. In 1880, they removed to Moradabad. The year 1890 will be memorable for the great agitation regarding baby marriages. Such revelations of inhumanity had been brought to light that Dr. Mansell drew up a petition, which was cheerfully signed by 55 woman physicians, and was presented to the Viceroy and Governor - General, pleading that the marriageable age of girls be raised to 14 years. The 13 instances—only a few out of many hundreds— given in the petition, of cruel wrongs, deaths, and <b>maimings</b> for life received by helpless child-wives at the hands of brutal husbands, which had come under her personal observation or that of her associates, were horrible almost beyond belief. While the Government was flooded with petitions and memorials from native Christians, Hindu women, and missionaries, it is stated that nearly all the speakers in the Legislative Council referred to the facts presented in this memorial, which had great influence in bringing about the change of raising the age to 12 years (not 14, as asked), [...] "possibly the most important step taken in the domestic and social life of the people since the abolishment of suttee, in 1829." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is {{generally}} considered to be the third oldest (or by some other circumstances, the second oldest) zoological park in the United States, having opened in 1876, sixteen years after the historic Park itself was purchased and opened to the city public. For a number of decades in the 20th century, it was operated and supervised by the Baltimore City Board of Park Commissioners, and organized in 1860 with the first major city park at Druid Hill and later the city Department of Parks and Recreation, through their subordinate Bureau of the Zoo. It was later assisted by the organization of a group of supportive friends, animal and wildlife lovers in the Baltimore City Zoological Society, which performed a saving function in the late 1960s when changing demographic and historical populations in the surrounding communities around Druid Hill Park resulted in increased crime and some harassment incidents to the animal population, resulting in a few deaths and <b>maimings,</b> resulted in a protective fence erected around the Zoo campus, and entrance ticketing center and gates which previously had been open to the surrounding Park. In later decades, by 2004, a course of action between the City and the Society resulted in a semi-private and new independent operation arrangement with a separate board of trustees for the Zoo with increased private, state and suburban counties funding to supplement the restricting resources of the central City. This also resulted in a renaming of the old City Zoo as [...] "The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore." [...] For several decades from the 1950s to the 1970s, the City Zoo was made famous locally through the media-savvy and through the new medium of television with programs and promotions of Dr. Arthur Watson, the long-time zoo director. In 1980, when the famous iconic [...] "Harborplace" [...] festival marketplace pavilions at the Inner Harbor by developer James Rouse, opened by downtown Baltimore's waterfront business district and its Patapsco River and Harbor, one of the stalls/stores was of stuffed and children's play fiber animals called [...] "Dr. Watson's Zoo," [...] owned and operated by the now retired Dr. Watson.|$|E

(2013) The Need for Full Integration of Snakebite Envenoming {{within a}} Global Strategy to Combat the Neglected Tropical Diseases: The Way Forward. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 7 (6) : e 2162. [URL] envenoming {{constitutes}} a serious medical condition that primarily affects residents of rural communities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and New Guinea [1], [2]. It is an occupational, environmental, and domestic health hazard that exacerbates the already impoverished state {{of these communities}} [3]. Conservative estimates indicate that, worldwide, more than 5 million people suffer snakebite every year, leading to 25, 000 – 125, 000 deaths, while an estimated 400, 000 people are left with permanent disabilities [4]–[7]. Eight thousand amputations {{are thought to be}} performed annually in Africa alone [8]. However, community-based surveys illustrate that the actual burden of human suffering is likely to be even greater [9], [10]. Despite this global impact, snakebite has received little attention from the global health community, the pharmaceutical industry, governments, and public health advocacy groups, and has a disappointingly low priority in the global health research agenda. As a consequence, the paucity of health programs addressing snakebite at national, regional, and global levels allows deaths or <b>maimings</b> of snakebite victims to continue. This burden of suffering could be significantly reduced because effective preventive and therapeutic resources are available, but, because of systemic neglect, they are not delivered in many regions. There has been progress in highlighting the neglect of snakebite. Thus, the inclusion of snakebite in the WHO list of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), and the development of initiatives by the WHO and its regional offices [1], [11] {{as well as by the}} Global Snakebite Initiative (GSI) [6] and other efforts at national and regional levels, have improved the global awareness of this disease. However, the impact of these projects has been rather limited, particularly in light of the progress made in control of the helminthic NTDs.
