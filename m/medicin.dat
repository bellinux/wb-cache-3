2500|$|In 2005, Per-Anders Rydelius, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Karolinska Institute, and Rolf Zetterstrom, past {{chief editor}} of Acta Paediatrica, have been {{critical}} of some research based on the Gothenburg study. In the Swedish trade journal Dagens <b>Medicin</b> they argued that the Gillberg group, in order to prove their hypothesis, repeatedly changed diagnoses and information in their material: [...] "Accessible articles (from the Gillberg group) reveal that those studied have been managed in an unscientific way - a conclusion which does not need strengthening by what could have been found in the destroyed research material". (Another problem is the boy:girl ratios in the study; the ratio in the control group is 1:1, whereas the ratio in the index groups is 4:1.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Burckhardt {{attended}} the Berlin Medical Conference of 1889, {{which was also}} attended by such heavyweight psychiatrists as Victor Horsley, Valentin Magnan and Emil Kraepelin, and presented a paper on his brain operations. While his findings were subsequently widely reported in the psychiatric literature, the reviews were unremittingly negative and there was much ill ease generated by the surgical procedures he had performed. He also published {{the results of the}} procedure in 1891 in the periodical Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie und psychischgerichtliche <b>Medicin</b> in an article entitled 'Uber Rindenexcisionen, als Beitrag zur operativen Therapie der Psychosen' ('Concerning cortical excision, as a contribution to the surgical treatment of psychosis'). This paper was his last significant medical publication. Kraepelin, writing in 1893, was scathing of Burckhardt's attempts, and stated that [...] "he [...] suggested that restless patients could be pacified by scratching away the cerebral cortex." [...] While Giuseppe Seppilli, an Italian professor of neuropsychiatry, remarked in 1891 that Burckhardt's view of the brain as modular did not [...] "fit in well with the view held by most [...] that the psychoses reflect a diffuse pathology of the cerebral cortex and [...] the conception of the psyche as a unitary entity".|$|E

30|$|In March 2014, {{hospitals}} in the Forest Region of Guinea reported clusters of an unidentified illness characterized by fever, severe diarrhea, and vomiting (Baize et al. 2014). On March 21, 2014, Ebola was laboratory confirmed, and the Government of Guinea declared its first Ebola outbreak, approximately 3  months after the suspected index case-patient developed symptoms in December 2013 (Baize et al. 2014; <b>Médicins</b> sans Frontières, Stockholm Evaluation Unit 2016). Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) deployed multi-disciplinary teams {{to set up an}} Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in Guekedou, Guinea, and initiated outbreak control measures (<b>Médicins</b> sans Frontières, Stockholm Evaluation Unit 2016). WHO’s Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deployed staff to support national efforts to stop transmission.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are a major}} worldwide burden, claiming 17. 1 million lives every year. In order to compensate and cope with this occlusive disease a process of of neovascularization takes place. Currently, the IL- 33 /ST 2 pathway and Toll-Like receptors are found as an important regulator of inflammatory responses and may trigger neovascularization. Since not all cardiovascular patients can benefit enough from neovascularization, it is of great importance to understand this compensatory mechanism and its pathways {{in order to find}} new targets for <b>medicins.</b> The present review will discuss the IL- 33 /ST 2 pathway, its role in neovascularization and the implication of Toll-Like receptors...|$|R
