50|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC), {{also known}} as <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>chromatography,</b> is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their size, {{and in some cases}} molecular weight. It is usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as gel-filtration chromatography, versus the name gel permeation chromatography, which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. SEC is a widely used polymer characterization method because of its ability to provide good molar mass distribution (Mw) results for polymers.|$|E
50|$|Venoms of {{the water}} cobras, were assayed for lethality, {{proteolytic}} activity and protein content. Naja annulata annulata and Naja christyi venoms averaged 89% protein and lacked proteolytic activity. The murine intraperitoneal LD50 of N. a. annulata and N. christyi venoms were 0.143 and 0.120 mg/kg, respectively. Polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute of Medical Research neutralized 575 and 200 LD50 of N. a. annulata and N. christyi venoms/ml antivenom, respectively. Cation exchange chromatography resolved four lethal peaks from N. a. annulata venom and six lethal peaks from N. christyi venom. The major lethal peaks (about 12% of total venom protein) were purified further with <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>chromatography</b> and were characterized as 61 (N. a. annulata toxin) and 62 (N. christyi toxin) residue polypeptides with four half-cystines. Elucidation of the complete amino acid sequences indicated that these toxins belonged to the short-chain class of postsynaptic neurotoxins. Short-chain neurotoxins 1 from N. a. annulata and N. christyi had murine intraperitoneal LD50 of 0.052 and 0.083 mg/kg, respectively, and showed over 80% homology with N. nigricollis alpha toxin. Reverse-phase analysis of another peak present in both venoms resolved a toxin that had an N-terminus identical to N. christyi short-chain neurotoxin 1. These fractions also contained toxins readily separable from the short-chain isotoxin by preparative reverse-phase chromatography. Amino acid sequencing of the first 28 residues indicated that both toxins were long-chain neurotoxins with identical N-termini. The LD50 of long-chain neurotoxins 2 from N. a. annulata and N. christyi venoms were 0.086 and 0.090 mg/kg, respectively. The venoms of these little-known elapids {{have some of the}} lowest intraperitoneal LD50 of any African Naja species studied thus far and have high concentrations of potent postsynaptic neurotoxins.|$|E

The effect of aggregation on binding of the receptor to immobilized pentamannose 6 -phosphate was also examined. Nonreducing SDS [...] PAGE followed by immunoblotting revealed that interchain disulfide bonds exist in detergent-solubilized and purified receptor preparations, but not in membrane-associated receptor. Reduction of the receptor with dithiothreitol abolished its ligand binding activity and drastically altered its ability to bind antibodies.

We cultured Group A streptococci (Type 12, Strain NY 5) in synthetic media by in vivo incubation within dialysis casing surgically implanted in rabbit peritoneum.

Clear-cut separation of the two components was also achieved by chromatography on BSA-CH-Sepharose and on DEAE-Bio Gel A. An important feature of these separations is that they do not require the use of denaturing conditions. The molecular weights of the leukocyte interferon components, as determined on Sephadex G- 75, are quite similar or identical, approximately 26, 000.

Mutants in certain other classes exhibited partial loss of another particular tryptophan enzyme activity. Tryptophan synthetase B activity was not detected in cell extract preparations but was detected in whole cells. The original map order proposed for the S. aureus tryptophan gene cluster was clarified by the definition of trpD (phosphoribosyl transferase−) and trpF (phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase−) mutants. These mutants were previously unresolved and designated as trp(DF) mutants (anthranilate accumulators).

A critical concentration for polymerization of 1. 3 microM was determined by measuring either the change in viscosity or absorbance at 232 nm.

Oxidation of NA was enhanced by a superoxide generation system and inhibited by the combined action of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Additionally, peroxidase activity on both synthetic (o-dianisidine) and biologically active (serotonin) substrates was also present in the salivary gland homogenates, this latter activity requiring hydrogen peroxide.

(2) This immunosuppression was not altered by a treatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor for synthesis of prostaglandin, but was diminished by a treatment with phorbol myristate acetate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of cardiac Na+–Ca 2 + exchange (NCX 1) with caveolin proteins {{was investigated in}} sarcolemmal vesicles. Western blots of sarcolemmal vesicles revealed the presence of caveolin- 1, - 2, and - 3. NCX 1 co-fractionated more closely with caveolin- 3 than caveolin- 1 on sucrose density gradients. NCX 1 has five possible caveolin-binding motifs and NCX 1 co-precipitated specifically with caveolin- 3. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> column <b>chromatography</b> indicated that this co-precipitation was not due to incomplete solubilization of lipid raft microdomains. Cholesterol chelation in vesicles decreased NCX 1 transport activity and caveolin- 3 co-precipitation. NCX 1 {{may play a role}} in caveolar transmembrane signaling in addition to its role in excitation–contraction coupling...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The present {{studies were}} {{designed}} to characterize selenium distribution in human mi & These studies reveal that most selenium in human milk is protein bound. Percentage dialyzable selenium varied proportionally with total selenium content of milk but not with stage of lactation. Neither rate offreezing nor frozen storage ofsamples for one month influenced distribution profiles. At least nine selenoprotcins were detected in dialyzed milk samples following <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> (Seph-adex) <b>chromatography.</b> Glutathione peroxidase accounted for- 15 - 30 % of selemum found in milk. Approximately half of peroxidase activity of human milk was associated with selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activity. Am J Clin Nuir 1987; 45 : 617 - 24.

40|$|AbstractGlycerate kinase from spinach leaves was {{purified}} to near homogeneity using PEG/MgCl 2 fractionation, ion exchange, <b>molecular</b> <b>sieving</b> and affinity <b>chromatography.</b> The purified enzyme is a monomer of Mr 40 000, shows a pI-value of 4. 8 {{and a broad}} pH optimum of 6. 5 – 8. 5 and {{is specific}} for D-isomer of glycerate. The high activity of crude enzyme (≈ 150 μmol. h− 1. mg chl− 1) indicates that glycerate kinase does not limit the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle...|$|R
