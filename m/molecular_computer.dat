2500|$|Early {{interactive}} <b>molecular</b> <b>computer</b> graphics {{systems were}} vector graphics machines, which used stroke-writing vector monitors, sometimes even oscilloscopes. [...] The electron beam does not sweep left-and-right as in a raster display. [...] The display hardware followed a sequential list of digital drawing instructions (the display list), directly drawing {{at an angle}} one stroke for each molecular bond. [...] When the list was complete, drawing would begin again {{from the top of}} the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), the display would flicker heavily. [...] Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in the display list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in the display unit, and the display unit would multiply all coordinates in the display list by the contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.|$|E
