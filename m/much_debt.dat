5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} Relief faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. <b>Much</b> <b>debt</b> relief legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional, ensuring that debt relief would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which {{turns out to be a}} huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.|$|E

5|$|The {{protectorate}} status had {{a negative}} effect on the island's trade with Tahiti. Ships from Rurutu, as from other protectorates, were considered foreign vessels at the ports of France and its overseas territories such as the Tahitian port capital of Papeete, Rurutu's nearest significant trading partner. Consequently, Rurutu's agricultural exports were subject to tariffs from which the exports of annexed territories were exempted. The economic disadvantages of the protectorate status became even more evident when France closed the Tahitian ports to all foreigners in 1899, including merchants from Rurutu, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco. This disruption of trade between the two islands occurred in a period during which Rurutu became increasingly reliant economically on Tahiti. The growing prominence of Tahiti was evidenced in the activities of Teuruarii, who regularly visited Papeete for trade and entertainment. Teuruarii incurred <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> during these trips, and the need to pay off his creditors along with the restriction on trade prompted him to consider formal annexation to France.|$|E

Jackson's mother gave birth to Thomas's sister Laura Ann the day after Jackson's father died. Julia Jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> and three young {{children}} (including the newborn). She sold the family's possessions to pay the debts. She declined family charity and moved into a small rented one-room house. Julia took in sewing and taught school to support herself and her three young children for about four years.|$|E

25|$|Hicks {{told reporters}} that from April 2007 to March 2009 he added an {{additional}} $85 million to HSG. According to Hicks, HSG took on too <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> because the teams were spending more than the budget allowed. However, according to Forbes, the revenue and operating net income of both the Rangers and the Dallas Stars went up from 2006 to 2008. Between the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the debt level for the Texas Rangers increased by approximately $100 million, {{the same time period}} when Hicks purchased Liverpool Football Club. From 2007 to 2009, Forbes reported the Rangers and the Stars were the third most leveraged franchises in their respective sports.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too <b>much</b> <b>debt,</b> and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Concentrating {{the company}} on {{consumer}} food, in 1994 he sold the Alpopetfood business to Nestlé for $510 million in cash. In February 1995 he participated in Grand Met's friendly takeover of Pet, Inc., the makers of Old El Paso branded Tex-Mex foods, for $2.6billion. A number of analysts feared {{at the time that}} Grand Met had overpaid for the company, and was taking on too <b>much</b> <b>debt,</b> but Walsh defended the acquisition, arguing, [...] "we are paying a fair price for attractive brands", adding that he had faith in the continued growth of the Tex-Mex food sector. In October 1995 he joined the Grand Met board of directors and assumed additional responsibility for Grand Met's Paris-based European food operations. In 1996 he was made chairman and president of Pillsbury. Investors Chronicle described Pillsbury as [...] "well managed" [...] under his leadership.

60|$|And the king, who {{from long}} {{experience}} was inured {{to dealing with}} suspicious creditors, wrote an order upon George Heriot, his well- beloved goldsmith and jeweller, for the sum of two hundred pounds, to be paid presently to Nigel Olifaunt, Lord of Glenvarloch, to be imputed as so <b>much</b> <b>debts</b> due {{to him by the}} crown; and authorizing the retention of a carcanet of balas rubies, with a great diamond, as described in a Catalogue of his Majesty's Jewels, to remain in possession of the said George Heriot, advancer of the said sum, and so forth, until he was lawfully contented and paid thereof. By another rescript, his Majesty gave the said George Heriot directions to deal with some of the monied men, upon equitable terms, for a sum of money for his Majesty's present use, not to be under 50,000 merks, but as much more as could conveniently be procured.|$|R
2500|$|Missing audits, {{convoluted}} transactions, including swap agreements make {{it difficult}} to state how <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> the city owes.

2500|$|As {{financial}} sponsors {{increase their}} returns by employing {{a very high}} leverage (i.e., a high ratio of debt to equity), they {{have an incentive to}} employ as <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> as possible to finance an acquisition. This has, in many cases, led to situations in which companies were [...] "over-leveraged", meaning that they did not generate sufficient cash flows to service their debt, which in turn led to insolvency or to debt-to-equity swaps in which the equity owners lose control over the business to the lenders.|$|E
2500|$|US News {{and others}} suggest another factor {{overlooked}} {{in terms of}} financing college, which is {{the length of time}} it takes to earn a degree.

Jacques Steinberg suggested that many college-bound students calculate how <b>much</b> <b>debt</b> they were likely to incur each year, and he suggested that debt for all four years of college should total less than the graduate's expected first year's salary after college, and preferably under $40,000. A handful of schools have [...] "free tuition" [...] policies for low income students, so that they graduate loan-free.|$|E
