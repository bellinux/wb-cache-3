25|$|Students at Laval University, Université de Montréal, and Université de Sherbrooke {{collected}} tens {{of thousands}} of books for a new library. Libraries in other Quebec communities solicited book donations and searched local archives for information on Mégantic's history. The new library, which had received 100,000 donated volumes (some of them duplicates) by September 2013, opened on May 5, 2014, as La <b>Médiathèque</b> municipale Nelly-Arcan in honour of an author born in the town.|$|E

The galleries displayed scientific exhibits, such as John Logie Baird's original apparatus, and television ephemera such as Wallace and Gromit and Play School toys. TV Heaven made accessible the museum's collection of television programmes, {{most of which are}} not available elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|There are {{hundreds}} of art galleries in Beirut and its suburbs. Every year hundreds of fine art students graduate from universities and institutions. Artist workshops exist all over Lebanon. The inauguration of the Beirut Art Center, a non-profit association, space and platform dedicated to contemporary art in Lebanon, in the Mkalles suburb of Beirut added {{to the number of}} exhibition spaces available in the city, with a screening and performance room, <b>mediatheque,</b> bookstore, cafe and terrace. Adjacent to the latter is the Ashkal Alwan Home Workspace, a venue hosting cultural events and educational programs.|$|E

25|$|Two former {{employees}} of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They {{are known for}} creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the fluidity and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō's <b>Mediatheque,</b> with cool white acrylic sheets on the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store's contents. Their dynamic of fluidity is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, floating aluminium roof supported by slender columns.|$|E
2500|$|Sion {{is home to}} 4 {{libraries}}. [...] These libraries include; the <b>Médiathèque</b> Valais Sion, the Bibliothèque municipale de Sion, the HES-SO Valais <b>Médiathèque</b> santé-social and the HES-SO Valais, Domaine Sciences de l'ingénieur. [...] There was {{a combined}} total (...) of 690,513 books or other media in the libraries, {{and in the same}} year a total [...] of 294,320 items were loaned out.|$|E
2500|$|BFI <b>Mediatheque</b> – Allows {{visitors}} {{to access the}} British Film Institute collection of film and television programmes in the BFI National Archive.

5000|$|Timbuctoo {{does not}} appear ever to have been shown on {{television}} in the UK, nor has it been made available commercially; however, unlike many quota quickie productions of the 1930s, the film has survived and is available to view by appointment {{at any of the}} <b>Mediatheques</b> run by the British Film Institute. [...] Although the film is billed as a comedy, it contains a sequence of a hippopotamus being hunted and killed which some modern viewers have found extremely unpleasant and distressing.|$|R
5000|$|Ito’s {{proposal}} was conceptually rooted in {{an idea of}} “fluid” space of technology discussed in his 1997 article Tarzan in the Media Jungle. Rather than viewing media as a foreign element to nature, Ito embraced new media/computing as forming {{an integral part of}} the contemporary urban environment. The building was conceived as a transparent cube through which thin floor plates float suspended on organic-looking seaweed-like “tubes.” The cube was meant to be read as a small representative element of an infinite, viscous information space, with the four edges sealed with glass facades which, through their reflections, would allow the building to alternately dematerialize or repeat itself creating a kind of ephemeral connection with infinite space. This concept of ephemerality of partitions was intimately linked with the <b>Mediatheque’s</b> mission to be barrier-free, in the sense of providing specialized services to those with visual, auditory or other physical impairments [...] Ito considered that the new library, as its role in the city shifts from a place of mere access to text-based information, requires a corresponding shift in the meaning of the term barrier-free to include a removal of architectural barriers which dictate how a space must be used.|$|R
2500|$|Building on {{elements}} from the Shōnandai Culture Centre, Itsuko Hasegawa undertook a number cultural and community centres throughout Japan. These included the Sumida Cultural Centre (1995) and the Fukuroi Community Centre (2001) where she involved {{the public in}} the process of design whilst exploring her own ideas about the filtration of light through the external walls into the interior. In his 1995 competition win for Sendai <b>Mediatheque,</b> Toyō Itō continued his earlier thoughts about fluid dynamics within the modern city with [...] "seaweed-like" [...] columns supporting a seven-story building wrapped in glass. His work later in the period, for example, the library to Tama Art University in Tōkyō in 2007 demonstrates more expressive forms, rather than the engineered aesthetic of his earlier works.|$|E
