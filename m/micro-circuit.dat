40|$|Harvesting {{energy from}} ultra-low-power {{vibration}} energy sources typically employs a rectifier circuit {{as the first}} power conditioning stage. The Schottky diode has a 0. 15 V - 0. 2 V threshold voltage and can not extract energy efficiently at low voltage. Other technologies such as MOSFET bridge or active diode are designed to minimize the voltage drop to reduce the conduction loss. However, these designs require either additional power supplies to operate comparators or have a larger threshold turn-on voltage than Schottky. Therefore, most rectifiers have an unresponsive or significant low-efficiency zone when the input power is low. This dissertation will elaborate on a backward diode based self-powered <b>micro-circuit</b> diode that will operate in the extremely weak or low alternating source applications, where the existing approaches offer poor outcomes. This proposed <b>micro-circuit</b> diode was compared to a Schottky diode in several experiment setup. The <b>micro-circuit</b> based half-wave rectifier circuit harvested 3. 1 mV DC at a 239. 5 Ohm load when the input magnitude is 50 mV while the Schottky diode was unable to convert this ultra-low AC power. This dissertation also provides the analysis of two alternating sources, the oscillatory electromagnetic generator and the piezoelectric energy harvester, to conduct experiments in a more realistic context. The <b>micro-circuit</b> diode shows excellent advantages in electromagnetic generator experiment, the <b>micro-circuit</b> based half-wave rectifier circuit harvested 5. 16 mV DC at a 0. 5 kOhm load when the input magnitude is 40 mV.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} sparsely-connected networks of integrate-and-fire neurons for ultra-short term information processing. We exploit {{the fact that the}} population activity of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition can switch from an oscillatory firing regime to a state of asynchronous irregular firing or quiescence depending on the rate of external background spikes. We find that in terms of information buffering the network performs best for a moderate, non-zero, amount of noise. Analogous to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance the performance decreases for higher and lower noise levels. The optimal amount of noise corresponds to the transition zone between a quiescent state and a regime of stochastic dynamics.
