5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

Prey animals may appear as predators, or vice versa; both predators and prey <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see (crypsis), or may be mistaken for other objects (mimesis). In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.|$|E

25|$|The {{first part}} of a symbol for a chord defines {{the root of the}} chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the {{instruments}} in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument). Failure to include the root means that the indicated chord <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> hear for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.|$|E
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discern the light flanks present {{in many of}} these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Narcosis may be {{completely}} reversed {{in a few}} minutes by ascending to a shallower depth, with no long-term effects. Thus narcosis while diving in open water rarely develops into a serious problem as long as the divers are aware of its symptoms, and are able to ascend to manage it. Due to its perception-altering effects, the onset of narcosis <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> recognize.

25|$|A {{problem with}} optimal health range {{is a lack}} of a {{standard}} method of estimating the ranges. The limits may be defined as those where the health risks exceed a certain threshold, but with various risk profiles between different measurements (such as folate and vitamin D), and even different risk aspects for one and the same measurement (such as both deficiency and toxicity of vitamin A) it is difficult to standardize. Subsequently, optimal health ranges, when given by various sources, have an additional variability caused by various definitions of the parameter. Also, as with standard reference ranges, there should be specific ranges for different determinants that affects the values, such as sex, age etc. Ideally, there should rather be an estimation of what is the optimal value for every individual, when taking all significant factors of that individual into account - a task that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve by studies, but long clinical experience by a physician may make this method more preferable than using reference ranges.|$|E

500|$|The male European nightjar's song is a {{sustained}} churring trill, given continuously {{for up to}} 10minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer turns his head.

500|$|One {{issue that}} {{occasionally}} rises {{is whether the}} monarchies are too expensive when compared to republics, or whether particular monarchies are more expensive than others, to maintain. This comparison <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding [...] the private property of the monarch. In the UK, the Crown Estate has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed [...] at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the Treasury) by every monarch since the accession of George III in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1 million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the expenses of the British royal family in this sense resulting in a [...] "negative cost" [...] of the British monarchy.|$|E
