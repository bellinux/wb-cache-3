25|$|DDR <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> width per {{channel is}} 64 bits (72 for ECC memory). Total module bit width {{is a product}} of bits per chip by number of chips. It also equals number of ranks (rows) multiplied by DDR <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> width. Consequently, a module with a greater number of chips or using ×8 chips instead of ×4 will have more ranks.|$|E
25|$|All ranks are {{connected}} to the same <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> (address+data). The Chip Select signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.|$|E
25|$|Adding modules to {{the single}} <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> creates {{additional}} electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the memory bottleneck, new chipsets employ the multi-channel architecture.|$|E

50|$|The <b>memory</b> data <b>bus</b> is 72 bits wide, with a 64 bits {{used for}} the data path and 8 bits used for error {{correcting}} code (ECC). The memory interface unit manages the bus and performs ECC checks on data coming into the processor. The ECC logic is capable of correcting single-bit errors. Compared to the POWER1, the RSC <b>memory</b> data <b>bus</b> is narrower and uses industry standard SIMMs instead of custom memory cards.|$|R
50|$|The downsides to this {{approach}} are; it introduces latency {{to the memory}} request, it requires additional power consumption for the buffer chips, and current implementations create a <b>memory</b> write <b>bus</b> significantly narrower than the <b>memory</b> read <b>bus.</b> This means workloads that use many writes (such as high-performance computing) will be significantly slowed. However, this slowdown is nowhere near as bad as not having enough memory capacity to avoid using significant amounts of virtual memory, so workloads that use extreme amounts of memory in irregular patterns might be helped by using fully buffered DIMMs.|$|R
25|$|With data being {{transferred}} 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (<b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600MB/s.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much {{slower than the}} <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern SRAM offers access times below 10ns, while DDR2 SDRAM offers access times below 20ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up. Using an external serial flash device rather than on-chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise (a process that is good for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block {{it is common to}} add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives, Ethernet controllers, DSL modems, wireless network devices, etc.|$|E
25|$|Many {{third party}} {{operating}} {{systems have been}} developed for the C64. As well as the original GEOS, two third-party GEOS-compatible systems have been written: Wheels and GEOS megapatch. Both of these require hardware upgrades to the original C64. Several other operating systems are or have been available, including WiNGS OS, the Unix-like LUnix, operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS Contiki, with full GUI. Other less well known OSes include ACE, Asterix, DOS/65 and GeckOS. A version of CP/M was released, but this requires the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus. Furthermore, the Z80 processor is underclocked to be compatible with the C64's <b>memory</b> <b>bus,</b> so performance is poor compared to other CP/M implementations. C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffer a lack of software; although most commercial CP/M software can run on these systems, software media is incompatible between platforms. The low usage of CP/M on Commodores means that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore disk format. The C64 CP/M cartridge is also not compatible with anything except the early 326298 motherboards.|$|E
40|$|Developing energy-aware {{software}} for multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) {{is a difficult}} task, which requires the knowl-edge {{of the distribution of}} the power consumption among sev-eral heterogeneous devices (cores, <b>memories,</b> <b>busses,</b> etc.). In this work we analyze the power breakdowns of power con-sumption for a complete MPSoC platform, under several ap-plication workloads and operating conditions. We leverage a complete-system simulation platform with accurate power models for all key hardware modules. Our analysis shows that caches and system interconnect dominate in the power breakdown, pointing out how software locality is meaningful not only for performance but also for energy optimization...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{heterogeneous}} multiprocessors {{will have}} custom <b>memory</b> and <b>bus</b> architectures that must balance resource sharing and system partitioning to meet cost constraints. We propose an augmented simulated annealing synthesis tool that uses system performance and layout evaluation to drive simultaneous data mapping, <b>memory</b> allocation and <b>bus</b> synthesis. A detailed {{look at the}} resulting automated design process reveals an approach that, contrary to prior approaches, optimizes bus topology first rather than last, providing design insight {{for the development of}} future tools. 1...|$|R

Dual ported buffers and registers allow the 82497 to concurrently handle CPU bus, <b>memory</b> <b>bus,</b> and internal cache operation for maximum performance. The 82492 is a customized high performance SRAM that supports 32-, 64-, and 128-bit wide <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> widths, 16-, 32-, and 64-byte line sizes, and optional sectoring. The data path between the CPU bus and the <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> is separated by the 82492, allowing the CPU bus to handshake synchronously, asynchronously, {{or with a}} strobed protocol, and allowing concurrent CPU bus and <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> operations.|$|E
50|$|Because a <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> to off-chip {{memory has}} {{many times the}} {{capacitance}} of an on-chip <b>memory</b> <b>bus,</b> a system with separate DRAM and CPU chips can have several times the energy consumption of an IRAM system with the same computer performance.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, DVFS {{has been}} {{recently}} {{proposed for the}} DDR3 <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> interface independently by two research groups in 2011 to scale memory power with throughput. Because the <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> voltage and frequency are independent of internal DRAM timings and voltages, scaling this interface should {{have no effect on}} memory cell integrity. Furthermore, David et al. claim their approach improves energy proportionality because the <b>memory</b> <b>bus</b> consumes a lot of static power that is independent of the bus utilization.|$|E

50|$|The {{first product}} was {{released}} on February 21, 2008. Not even four months older than the initial G92 release, all 9-series designs are simply revisions to existing late 8-series products. The 9800GX2 uses two G92 GPUs, as used in later 8800 cards, in a dual PCB configuration while still only requiring a single PCI-Express 16x slot. The 9800GX2 utilizes two separate 256-bit <b>memory</b> <b>busses,</b> one for each GPU and its respective 512 MB of memory, which equates to an overall of 1 GB of memory on the card (although the SLI configuration of the chips necessitates mirroring the frame buffer between the two chips, thus effectively halving the memory performance of a 256-bit/512MB configuration). The later 9800GTX features a single G92 GPU, 256-bit data bus, and 512 MB of GDDR3 memory.|$|R

40|$|Shared memory {{programming}} systems {{present a}} helpful abstraction to the parallel programmer. However, modern commodity and near commodity architectures, such as Networks-of-Workstations (IBM SP/ 2) and Piles-of-PCs (Beowulf) lack hardware support for memory operations that span multiple <b>memory</b> <b>busses.</b> Such architectures require software support for shared memory operations. Two important design choices by which software shared memory {{can be characterized}} are namespace model and access method. In order to provide the sematics and ease-of-use of shared memory multiprocessors, distributed memory systems must provide a global namespace and a transparent (implicit) access method. This paper describes Hrunting, a freeware distributed shared memory (DSM) system for Beowulf-class multicomputers that satisfies both requirements.
