From 1939, companies in other Australian states {{had been involved in}} manufacturing aircraft engines for the RAAF, notably the Gipsy Major engines for DH82 Tiger Moths and single-row Wasp radial engines for the Wirraway fighter. From the beginning of 1942, as part of the general gearing up of industry in Queensland, aviation companies commenced the overhaul of aircraft engine for the USAAF. Australian National Airways Pty Ltd at Archerfield Aerodrome produced its first two reconditioned radial engines in May 1942.

40|$|Abstract. When set {{of basic}} web service is built, {{the next step}} is to create more complex one. A {{programmatic}} approach uses declarative language such as BPEL. This kind of representation is verbose and needs assistance for the creation of business process. We defined a generative strategy leading by formal specification. Because, web service composition languages use standard operators like sequence, choice and parallel; process algebras are right candidate for their design. We use higher order pi calculus for specification of orchestration and consider it as a basis for generating BPEL skeleton. After enrichment of BPEL definition, we interpret it by mobile agents. They play role of a conductor which evaluates a part or a whole BPEL definition. This <b>mobile</b> <b>engine</b> reduces message traffic by replacing message transfer into local message operating.

40|$|Retrofitting, {{which means}} {{retrofitting}} old generation engine systems with modern exhaust after treatment systems, {{is becoming increasingly}} popular, which allow vehicles {{to adhere to the}} newer and more stringent emission norms. This can save the operators of such vehicles money using older engineered designs without the need to design a new unit or buy an expensive new machine or vehicle. At present, there is a growing interest in emissions from off-road vehicles and the introduction of minimum limits for older vehicles that must be met {{in order to be able}} to allow for their operation. For the purposes of this article, the Stage IIIA farm tractor has been fitted with a particulate filter in the exhaust system.

Copyrighted and published by Elsevier, this article can be found at: [URL] activated cooling {{has the potential of}} utilizing thermal sources that currently go unused such as engine exhaust heat or industrial waste heat. Using these heat sources can provide enhanced energy utilization and reduced fuel usage in applications where cooling is needed. The concept developed here uses waste heat from stationary and <b>mobile</b> <b>engine</b> cycles to generate cooling for structures and vehicles. It combines an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with a conventional vapor compression cycle. A nominal 5 kW cooling capacity prototype system was developed based on this concept and tested under laboratory conditions. In order to maintain high system performance while reducing size and weight for portable applications, microchannel based heat transfer components and scroll based expansion and compression were used. Although the system was tested off of its design point, it performed well achieving 4. 4 kW of cooling at a measured heat activated COP of 0. 48. Both the conversion and 2 nd law efficiencies were close to the model results, proving it to be an attractive technology. The measured isentropic efficiency of the scroll expander reached 84 %, when the pressure ratio was close to the scroll intrinsic expansion ratio. The reduced cooling capacity was attributed to off design operation...|$|E

50|$|Present-day {{charge air}} cooler systems, based on {{aluminium}} alloys, experience durability problems at temperatures and pressures necessary to meet the U.S. Tier 4i standards for stationary and <b>mobile</b> <b>engines.</b> Published reports estimate that the average life of an aluminium {{charge air cooler}} is currently only about 3,500 hours. Aluminium is near its upper technological limit to accommodate higher temperatures and thermal stress levels because the tensile strength of the metal declines rapidly at 150¬∞C and repetitive thermal cycling between 150¬∞C and 200¬∞C substantially weakens it. Thermal cycling creates weak spots in aluminium tubes, which in turn causes charge air coolers to fail prematurely. A potential option is to install stainless steel precoolers in aluminium charge air coolers, but limited space and the complexity of this solution is a hampering factor for this option.|$|R
