50|$|Numerous grasses {{are found}} on this alvar {{including}} <b>Meadow</b> <b>Oat-grass</b> and Sheep's Fescue; {{as would be}} expected from the occurrence of orchids, many fungi grow on the Stora Alvaret such as Hygrocybe persistens and Lepiota alba.

50|$|The site {{supports}} {{an area of}} semi-natural magnesian limestone grassland, {{in which}} blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, is the dominant species. Glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, quaking grass, Briza media, <b>meadow</b> <b>oat-grass,</b> Avenula pratensis, rock-rose, Helianthemum nummularium, and fragrant orchid, Gymnadenia conopsea, are common, while sea plantain, Plantago maritima, is locally abundant in the grassland {{at the edge of}} limestone spoil heaps.|$|E
50|$|The main {{species of}} grass is upright brome (Bromus erectus), though {{tor-grass}} (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common. In areas of heavy grazing, sheep fescue (Festuca ovina) and <b>meadow</b> <b>oat-grass</b> (Helictotrichon pratense) can take over. Blue sedge (Carex flacca), spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), and devil’s bit (Succisa pratensis) are also common.|$|E

50|$|The Whin Sill is an igneous rock, Dolerite, {{which gives}} rise to a soil {{chemistry}} particular to the location, and thus to a distinct habitat for vegetation. Soil on the Whin Sill is thin and prone to drought in summer months. Plant species found at the site include the Perennial plant wild onion (Allium vineale), maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides), common rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium), <b>meadow</b> <b>oat-grass</b> (Avenula pratensis) and crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha).

More acidic areas provide habitat for sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina) and bell heather (Erica cinerea).|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{a range of}} habitats which include unimproved calcareous grassland, woodland and scrub, cliff faces and scree slopes. The grassland is of major importance and it comprises a tall ungrazed sward. This is dominated by tor-grass, upright brome, <b>meadow</b> <b>oat-grass,</b> sweet vernal-grass and quaking grass. It is noted for its range of herbs which include salad burnet, common rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil. The quarry floors support wild thyme, dwarf thistle, yellow-wort and autumn gentian. The site supports many plants which are scarce at a national or county level. These include fly orchid, musk orchid and purple milk-vetch. It {{is one of a}} small number of sites which support meadow clary in the county.|$|E
50|$|Brada Hill's {{escarpment}} has flourishing {{populations of}} plants {{suited to a}} thin dry soil, including maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) and wild onion (Allium vineale) amidst red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Annual flora at the site include hare’s-foot clover (Trifolium arvense), knotted trefoil (T. striatum), forget-me-not (Myosotis spp.) and dove’s-tail cranesbill (Geranium molle) Perennial flora include common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) and <b>meadow</b> <b>oat-grass</b> (Avenula pratensis). A number of coarse grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), and herbs including red campion (Silene dioica), hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and common nettle (Urtica dioica), grow in isolated areas of deeper soil. Heath pearlwort (Sagina subulata), as well as grasses, wild onion and maiden pink grow amidst slab rocks which form the hill top.
