40|$|The paper applies an Efficient Global Optimization method (EGO) {{to improve}} the efficiency, in flux {{weakening}} region, of a given 5 -phase Permanent Magnet (PM) machine. An optimal control for the four independent currents is thus defined. Moreover, a <b>modification</b> <b>proposal</b> of the machine geometry {{is added to the}} optimization process of the global drive. The effectiveness of the method allows solving the challenge which consists in taking into account inside the control strategy the eddy-current losses in magnets and iron. In fact, magnet losses are a critical point to protect the machine from demagnetization in flux-weakening region. But these losses, which highly depend on magnetic state of the machine, must be calculated by Finite Element Method (FEM) to be accurate. The FEM has the drawback to be time consuming. It is why a direct optimization using FEM is critical. EGO method, using sparingly FEM, allows to find a feasible solution to this hard optimization problem of control and design of multi-phase drive...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementDecision {{analysis}} has {{a central role}} in decision-making as it aids the decision-maker in identifying the most suitable alternative, matching the decision-makers preferences. Several of the tools used today focus to some degree on particular outcomes and do consequently provide the decision maker with a one-dimensional answer. Statutory requirements state that the decision analysis performed should take multiple stakeholders preferences and knowledge into account when evaluating Risk-Reducing Measures. From this, it is assumed that a more balanced perspective that goes beyond expected values is required to aid decision-making. The use of modifications to retain performance on existing safety barriers and systems is presented, as modifications often are performed to compensate for unreliability and loss of quality affected by; human errors, accidents, unreliability and/or changes in statutory requirements. With the starting point of the thesis is to make a tool for decision support in the selection of <b>modification</b> <b>proposals,</b> there has been performed a minor review of commonly used methods for evaluations in decision-making. The multi-attribute theory appears to be a reasonable approach, which may be used when there is limited knowledge regarding future consequences. As a result, the thesis has suggested a framework for implementation of a multi-attribute analysis that reflects different stakeholders concerns based on strategies and philosophies generated by an E&P company. A relative weighting index has been suggested to reflect various stakeholders concerns. It has also been performed a case study on previous <b>modification</b> <b>proposals</b> to see how the framework aligns in practice, and various stakeholders preferences affect the prioritisation. A suggestion on how Multi-attribute theory can be implemented into a decision-making process, to reflect possible lack of knowledge and creation of alternatives to enlighten key points of disagreement are further presented...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{emphasizes}} {{possibilities for}} substantially reducing energy consumption with modern ecofriendly buildings. Passive building construction is a {{sector of the}} construction industry that has extremely low demand for the energy for heating house interiors. A passive house requires {{a small amount of}} energy to provide thermal comfort, but it requires proper systems (HRU, heat pumps, solar collectors) to accomplish that effect. The <b>modification</b> <b>proposal</b> presented in the paper has dramatically reduced the demand for heat capacity of the building. Unfortunately the passive standard has not been reached, but thermomodernisation would allow for a significant reduction of heating costs. The demand per 1 m 2 of heated surface area in a traditional building was 41. 9 W/m 2, while after the modification – only 15. 01 W/m 2. The tested building, if located in a warmer climate, with an average outside temperature of ≥ - 10 ºC would certainly perform its function. The use of modern technology ensures high energy savings. Such solutions, however, are not the cheapest on the market, and therefore are less available. The construction of a passive solar buildings is a “green” investment with tangible environmental results. By ensuring the thermomodernisation of a traditional building we can enjoy real environmental and economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{evaluation}} of the possibilities and importance of art education of pupils with visual impairment in elementary education. The aim of the thesis is to present the possibilities and importance of art education for the development of cognitive and motor function of the upper limbs of young learners with visual disabilities. The practical aim is to create a modified school educational program (SEP) for the subject area Art education that would address the special needs of pupils with visual impairment or blind at the first grade of primary school. The thesis consists of theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is divided into five main chapters. The first chapter is devoted to the definition of visual impairment, its classification and structuring by grade, type and causes. The second chapter is about the etiology of visual impairment. The third chapter deals with the specific development of children with visual impairment at school age. Specifically, the cognitive development of children this age with visual impairment is described. The focus is on the visual, auditory and tactile perception as well as attention, memory, thinking and speech. The fourth chapter describes the capabilities of the elementary education related to teaching students with visual impairments. First, the related legislation, early care and preschool education are noted. Afterwards, {{a large part of the}} chapter is devoted to elementary education either through integration or at the elementary school for the visually impaired. Basic information on secondary education is also provided for the sake of completeness. The last theoretical chapter is dedicated to the art education for pupils with visual impairment. The practical part presents the proposed modification of elementary school education program for mainstream schools. First, the presented aims and methodology of the practical part are listed, including a description of the research and analysis of the SEP field for elementary schools. The last part includes the <b>modification</b> <b>proposal</b> itself; the original and modified curriculum and expected outputs and methodological supplement specifically for blind and visually impaired students are presented in form of dedicated tables. Qualitative approaches were used for the practical part of the thesis. The data were collected by an analysis of documents (specifically school education program).

40|$|William Wordsworth wrote A Guide Through the District of the Lakes {{under the}} {{influence}} of a cultural movement which had stemmed from he picturesque aesthetics initiated by William Gilpin and others. It is evident that this work is in the tradition of a guidebook because the author is loyal to its conventions which Gilpin and Thomas West, another picturesque advocate and famous guidebook writer, formulated. But Guide is unique In a certain deviation from the tradition, and that is where the author goes beyond the picturesque aesthetics and thus Wordsworth, the poet and present-day wrier, emerges. In the historical description of the landscape of the Lake District, the author blamed late settlers for inadequate management of the area which led to deterioration of the landscape, and articulated the social shift to the machine-based production system which too had begotten its decline. Then he made some <b>modification</b> <b>proposals</b> as well as the plan for fashioning this region into national property, so Guide is also the book of accusation and improvement. The pivotal question is what enabled him to state these things. Wordsworth did not perceive landscape as the picturesque school had done and recommended. They view nature as a picture, which allows people to see selectively, while he views it as it is, including the changing aspects of the landscape even if they are unappealing. And by applying this visual mode in the work itself, Wordsworth tried to convert the taste or the value system of his contemporaries from aesthetical to environmental, and this intent is substantially the same as the one expressed in Lyrical Ballads, where the poet aimed to displace the readers' traditional ideas of poetry and poetics. Lastly, Guide could be regarded as the call to protect the environment, which is unquestionably of paramount concern to us today...|$|R
