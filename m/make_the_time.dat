5|$|Former Dalhousie University {{student and}} {{national}} record holder Kiera Aitken participated {{on behalf of}} Bermuda for her second Olympic appearance after the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Aitken participated in the August 10 preliminaries for the 100meters women's backstroke, where she was placed in Heat 1 with Paraguay's Maria Virginia Baez and Panama's Christie Marie Bodden Baca. With a time of 1:02.62, Aitken ranked first in her heat, defeating Baez by almost three seconds. However, her overall ranking placed her thirty-third out of forty-nine swimmers between Alana Dillette of the Bahamas (32nd) and Hiu Wai Sherry Tsai of Hong Kong (34th). Aitken was 3.62 seconds slower than Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, who set an Olympic record during the preliminary round {{with a time of}} 59.00seconds. Aitken did not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> necessary to progress to the next round.|$|E

25|$|After a {{qualifying}} period {{as a general}} duties rifleman, Marines {{have the opportunity to}} specialise in a chosen trade. A number of these open to the Royal Marines Reservists are Assault Engineer, Landing Craft, Skills at Arms Instructor, Physical Training Instructor and Swimmer Canoeist. The majority of courses are abridged versions of those undertaken by regulars, courses usually last two to four weeks. Four-week courses are divided up into separate two-week packages. As reservists progress through the ranks in the RMR, they can attend further courses in their chosen specialisation that are of a more advanced nature (e.g.. LC3 - Marine; LC2 - Corporal; LC1 - Sergeant). However, many reservists are given the opportunity to attend the full courses undertaken by regulars if they are able to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> available.|$|E

25|$|After a rest day, {{the riders}} {{took in the}} Tour's hardest stage, and the last chance for the climbers to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> gains they’d need before the final time trial. The race was thought to split up {{somewhat}} on the brutal Port de Larrau (14.7km climb at 8.1%), {{despite the fact that}} its summit came just 79km into the stage. The race dipped into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year's Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the Col de la Pierre St Martin (14.2km climb at 5.2%) before descending {{to the start of the}} difficult, and very steep, first-category Col de Marie-Blanque (9.3km climb at 7.4%). The riders then climbed the infamous Col d'Aubisque (16.7km climb at 7%), which rewarded out-and-out climbing ability and punish the legs of all the major contenders.|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E
500|$|Roger Sutton from Horn Book Magazine {{felt that}} the moment Marcus {{explains}} this flaw to Miranda is the first exchange that shows the novel to be complicated and mysterious. Quattlebaum noted, [...] "The story's structure– an expert interweaving of past, present and future– brilliantly contradicts Miranda's commonsensical belief that the end can't happen before the middle." [...] Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel, where going back in time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it. She hoped to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> travel element logical to show that [...] "Miranda wasn't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe, but learning that her world has value and that people do care about her".|$|E
