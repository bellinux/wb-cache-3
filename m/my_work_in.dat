Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin comics, whilst Warhol used [...] and even made a series of paintings with Hergé as the subject. Warhol, who admired Tintin's [...] "great political and satirical dimensions", said, [...] "Hergé has influenced <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the same way as Walt Disney. For me, Hergé was more than a comic strip artist".|$|E
500|$|Rejewski {{had written}} a [...] "Report of Cryptologic Work on the German Enigma Machine Cipher" [...] in 1942. [...] Before his 1967 retirement, he began writing his [...] "Memoirs of <b>My</b> <b>Work</b> <b>in</b> the Cipher Bureau of Section II of the [...] General Staff", which were {{purchased}} by the Polish Military Historical Institute, in Warsaw. [...] Rejewski had often wondered what use Alan Turing (who in early 1940 had visited the Polish cryptologists at PC Bruno outside Paris) and the British at Bletchley Park had ultimately made of the Polish discoveries and inventions. For nearly three decades after the war, little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. [...] In a 1967 book Władysław Kozaczuk, associated with the Military Historical Institute, disclosed Poland's breaking of the German Enigma ciphers.|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is also {{difficult}} to classify Tyler {{in terms of}} themes; as she herself notes, “I don’t think of <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> terms of themes. [...] I’m just trying to tell a story.” [...] Tyler goes on to say, “Any large 'questions of life’ that emerge in my novels are accidental—not a reason for writing the novel {{in the first place}} but either (1) questions that absorb my characters, quite apart from me, or (2) on occasion, questions that may be thematic to my own life at the moment, even if I’m not entirely aware of them. Answers, if they come, come from the characters’ experiences, not from mine, and I often find myself viewing those answers with a sort of distant, bemused surprise.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1969, Cage {{produced}} the first fully notated work in years: Cheap Imitation for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie's Socrate, and, as both listeners and Cage himself noted, openly sympathetic to its source. Although Cage's affection for Satie's music was well-known, it was highly unusual {{for him to}} compose a personal work, {{one in which the}} composer is present. When asked about this apparent contradiction, Cage replied: [...] "Obviously, Cheap Imitation lies outside of what may seem necessary in <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> general, and that's disturbing. I'm the first to be disturbed by it." [...] Cage's fondness for the piece resulted in a recording—a rare occurrence, since Cage disliked making recordings of his music—made in 1976. Overall, Cheap Imitation marked a major change in Cage's music: he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments, and tried out several new approaches, such as improvisation, which he previously discouraged, but was able to use in works from the 1970s, such as Child of Tree (1975).|$|E

2500|$|On December 29, 2013 DiFranco {{issued an}} apology, announcing {{that she was}} {{cancelling}} the retreat, stating that [...] "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege {{or the fact that}} i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do <b>my</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... i think many positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design.
