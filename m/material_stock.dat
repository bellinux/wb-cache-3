Current socioeconomic metabolism research traces flows of energy, materials or substances to capture resource use: input of raw materials or energy, their fate in production and consumption, and the discharge of wastes and emissions. This approach has yielded important insights into eco-efficiency and long-term drivers of resource use. But socio-metabolic research has not yet fully incorporated <b>material</b> <b>stocks</b> or their services, hence not completely exploiting the analytic power of the metabolism concept. This commentary argues for a material stock–flow–service nexus approach focused on the analysis of interrelations between material and energy flows, socioeconomic <b>material</b> <b>stocks</b> (“in-use stocks of materials”) and the services provided by specific stock/flow combinations. Analyzing the interrelations between stocks, flows and services will allow researchers to develop highly innovative indicators of eco-efficiency and open new research directions that will help to better understand biophysical foundations of transformations towards sustainability...|$|R

5000|$|Timber framing and [...] "post-and-beam" [...] {{construction}} are {{methods of}} building with heavy timbers (posts and beams) rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is {{the method of}} creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting <b>material</b> <b>stock.</b> Hewing with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (brace and bit) and other laborious woodworking, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method {{has been used for}} thousands of years {{in many parts of the}} world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.|$|E

40|$|Hempel Coatings Company have into {{products}} assortment a {{group of}} paints {{which is based on}} isocyanate pre-polymer resins which cure with moisture forming a coating based on polyurea. These paints are called 1 component polyurethanes (1 K PU) or moisture curing polyurethanes (MCU). The principal function of these paints is the protection of substrates providing durability to the assets. This project was proposed by Protective Coatings R&D Department due to two reasons: - The resins and water scavengers used for 1 K PU are used only for these products so it is really important to have as reduced raw <b>materials</b> <b>stock</b> as possible. In addition these coatings represent {{a small percentage of the}} overall Hempel’s Coatings production. - Recently REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) has included all the products containing MDI isocyanate monomer/oligomer in the risk sentence R 40, limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect, and two 1 K PU coatings existing in Hempel contain this isocyanate. Thus this project was thought to study the isocyanate resins and water scavengers available in Hempel’s raw <b>materials</b> <b>stock</b> to reformulate the existing products. When reformulating the existing products the aim is improve 1 K PU performance, reduce raw <b>materials</b> <b>stock</b> and, if possible, avoid the use of MDI isocyanates. The project planning consists of the reformulation of all the possible alternatives of the existing standard products using the raw materials available. Afterwards the products formulated must be produced by vacuum dissolver in order to avoid the moisture incorporation. Finally these products have to be applied on the panels for the final testing. The main properties that 1 K PU products need to present have been tested and the best combination of isocyanate resins and water scavengers should be found out...|$|R

In this study, <b>material</b> <b>stock</b> analysis (MSA) is used to examine the losses of building and infrastructure materials after this disaster. Estimates of the magnitude of <b>material</b> <b>stock</b> that has lost its social function as a result of a disaster can indicate the quantities required for reconstruction, help garner a better understanding of the volumes of waste flows generated by that disaster, and also help in the course of policy deliberations in the recovery of disaster-stricken areas. Calculations of the lost building and road materials in the five prefectures most affected were undertaken. Analysis in this study is based on the use of geographical information systems (GIS) databases and statistics; it aims to (1) describe in spatial terms what construction materials were lost, (2) estimate the amount of infrastructure material needed to rehabilitate disaster areas, and (3) indicate the amount of lost <b>material</b> <b>stock</b> that should be taken into consideration during government policy deliberations. Our analysis concludes that the <b>material</b> <b>stock</b> losses of buildings and road infrastructure are 31. 8 and 2. 1 million tonnes, respectively.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} on material flow analysis {{has been focused}} on quantitative characterization of past material flows. Fewer analyses exist on past and prospective quantification of <b>stocks</b> of <b>materials</b> in-use. Some of these analyses explore the composition of products’ stocks, but a focus on the characterization of <b>material</b> <b>stocks</b> and its relation with service delivery is often neglected. We propose the use of the methods of human demography to characterize <b>material</b> <b>stocks,</b> defined herein as stock demographics, exploring the insights that this approach could provide for the sustainable management of materials. We exemplify an application of stock demographics by characterizing the composition and service delivery of iron, steel, and aluminum stocks of cars in Great Britain, 2002 – 2012. The results show that in this period the stock has become heavier, it is traveling less, and it is idle for more time. The visualization of material stocks’ dynamics demonstrates the pace of product replacement as a function of its usefulness and enables the formulation of policy interventions and the exploration of future trends.
