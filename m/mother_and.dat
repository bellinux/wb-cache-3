40|$|Shared {{decision}} making between {{children and parents}} is required in orthodontics. This study compared agreement among <b>mothers,</b> fathers, <b>and</b> children regarding the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children. A sample of 71 child patients (41 girls and 30 boys) aged 12. 6 years with an orthodontic treatment need, together with both their parents completed components of the child OHRQoL measure. Agreement among children, <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> fathers {{was derived from the}} 31 analogous questions and assessed using comparison and correlation analyses. Comparison analyses identified significant differences between <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports and between father's and children's reports. The magnitude of the difference between <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports, and between father's and children's reports could best be described as moderate (standard difference > 0. 2). In addition, absolute differences in scores constituted between 12 and 18 per cent of domain and overall scores for both <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> children's, and father's and children's reports. Correlation analysis, at the individual family unit level, showed that agreement between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children, and between fathers and children was fair [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) < 0. 04]. Neither mothers nor fathers know their child's oral health status very well, as there was significant disagreement between mothers', fathers', and children's perceptions. The disagreement between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children, and fathers and children was similar. While at the group level, <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> fathers tended to agree on perception of their children's oral health status, at an individual family unit level they did not. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the health needs of economically disadvantaged <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> {{children living in}} Grant County {{to determine if they}} were being met by the existing community health resources.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents with less quality {{can be seen}} through adolescent’s attitude which tends to be non-open to speak of matters and it results conflicts between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children. The goal {{of this research is}} to prove the effectiveness of communication skills training in improving the quality of the {{relationship between}} <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents. The method that is used in the communication skills training is the lecturing method, roleplay, case study, and the imaging method. The quality between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents is measured using the quality scale of the relationship between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children. The subject of this research has amount of 18 mothers which have Senior High School educational background and have children that are adolescents. The data is analyzed using Mann-Withney U Test and Wilcoxon T Test. The result of the research shows the quality of the experimental group that has been given the communication skills training has improved, while the control group has not. Therefore, it can be concluded that communication skills training is effective {{to improve the quality of}} the relationship between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents. The result of qualitative research shows the significant improvement of quality of the relationship between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents is on mothers who have female adolescents who are still in their early teenage years. The improvement of mothers’ skills in doing an open communication with adolescents makes the situation of communication become fun. In this case, adolescents feel comfortable to speak of problems with <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> they also feel satisfied with the control which is done by mothers so that it can create the feeling of trusting each other, supporting each other, and appreciating each other between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Contact {{behaviours}} such as touch, {{have been}} shown to be influential channels of nonverbal communication between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> infants. While existing research has examined the communicative roles of maternal or infant touch in isolation, mutual touch, whereby touching behaviours occur simultaneously between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their infants, has yet to be examined. The present study was designed to investigate mutual touch during face-to-face interactions between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their 5 ½ -month-old full-term (n = 40), very low birth weight/preterm (VLBW/preterm; n = 40) infants, and infants at psychosocial risk (n = 41). Objectives were to examine: (1) how the quantitative and qualitative aspects of touch employed by <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their infants varied across the normal periods of the still-face (SF) procedure and how these were associated with risk status, and (2) the association between co-touch and the quality of the mother-child relationship. Mutual touch was systematically coded using the Co-Touch Scale (Mantis, Ng, Stack, 2010). Interactions were found to largely consist of mutual contact and mutual touch, highlighting that active co-touching is pervasive during mother-infant interactions. Consistent with the literature, while the SF period did not negatively affect the amount of mutual touch engaged in for <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their full-term infants <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their infants at psychosocial risk, it did for <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their VLBW/preterm infants. Together, results illuminate how both <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> infants participate in shaping and co-regulating their interactions through the use of touch and underscore the contribution of examining the impact of birth status on mutual touch...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{co-occurrences}} of low serum ferritin and zinc <b>and</b> anaemia among <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their children in two agro-ecological zones of rural Ethiopia. Methods: Data were collected from 162 lactating <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their breast fed children aged 6 - 23 months. The data were collected via a structured interview, anthropometric measurements, and blood tests for zinc, ferritin and anaemia. Correlation, Chi square and multivariable analysis were used to determine the association between nutritional status of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children, and agro-ecological zones. Results: Low serum levels of iron and zinc, anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia were found in 44. 4, 72. 2, 52. 5 and 29. 6 % of children and 19. 8, 67. 3, 21. 8, 10. 5 % of mothers, respectively. There was a strong correlation between the micronutrient status of the <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> the children for ferritin, zinc and anaemia (P < 0. 005). Deficiency in both zinc and ferritin and one of the two was observed in 19. 1 %, and 53. 7 % of the <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> 32. 7 % and 46. 3 %, of their children, respectively. In the 24 h before the survey, 82. 1 % of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> 91. 9 % of their infants consumed foods that can decrease zinc bioavailability while only 2. 5 % of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> 3. 7 % of their infants consumed flesh foods. Conclusion: This study shows that micronutrient deficiencies were prevalent among lactating <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their children, with variation in prevalence across the agro-ecological zones. This finding calls for a need to design effective preventive public health nutrition programs to address both the mothers’ and their children’s needs...|$|R

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
