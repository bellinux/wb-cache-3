Various Maltese social groups switch {{back and forth between}} the two languages, or <b>macaronically</b> mix lexical aspects of Maltese and English while engaging in informal conversation or writing.|$|E
50|$|Arablish, a {{portmanteau}} {{combining the}} words Arabic and English, is a slang {{term for the}} phenomenon of code-switching between the two languages and/or <b>macaronically</b> using features of one in the other. It is alternatively termed Arbalizi, a portmanteau combining the words Arabic and Inglizi (the word for 'English' in Arabic).|$|E

Read in the French manner, it <b>macaronically</b> becomes [...] "Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca." [...] ("Where is Pauline the maid? At the station. She's pissing and taking a shit.") In English literature, the untranslated line makes an appearance in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.|$|E
5000|$|Bislish is a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} Bisaya and English, which refers {{to any of the}} Visayan languages of the Philippines <b>macaronically</b> infused with English terms. It is an example of code mixing. An example of Bislish as spoken in Cebuano-speaking areas would be, [...] "Tired na jud ko my friend, how far pa house nimo?" [...] which means [...] "I am so tired already my friend. How far is your house?". Another example in Hiligaynon-speaking areas is [...] "Lagaw kita at the park, magkit-anay ta sa friends naton didto.", which means [...] "Let's stroll at the park, we'll meet our friends there." ...|$|E
40|$|Grantha {{character}} set and encode them as Grantha NNNA and Grantha LLLA. Epigraphists ’ view of NNNA and LLLA in Grantha Before addressing each letter’s inclusion into Grantha, I {{would like to}} address the issue of whether Grantha script ever included the letters NNNA and LLLA. Over several centuries both Grantha and Tamil scripts have been used <b>macaronically</b> in inscriptions. Sometimes this has resulted in Tamil NNNA or LLLA being used in words in which other characters are from the Grantha script. Notwithstanding these occurrences, there has been no epigraphist who has called LLLA and NNNA as Grantha characters. Not surprisingly, books describing Grantha alphabet do not include LLLA and NNNA as Grantha letters. As a result, we can say that there is no evidence that Grantha {{character set}} ever included NNNA and LLLA. On the inclusion of NNNA in the Grantha script Going by the order of letters presented in L 2 / 12 - 039, let us look at NNNA first. The example given in the proposal as justifying the addition of NNNA to Grantha is a false evidence, which is obvious to anyone with a basic knowledge of the use of Tamil and Grantha scripts by the Tamils. Exhibit 1. Example used by Everson in proposal L 2 / 12 - 039 The example given is grammatically and orthographically Tamil. This is an example of th...|$|E
