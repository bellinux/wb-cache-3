40|$|Curcumin {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} Indian medicine for many centuries for its antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties and Garlic is a popular spice added to several <b>edible</b> <b>preparations</b> and is a remedy for a variety of ailments. The protective effects of Curcumin and Garlic on cisplatin induced chromosomal aberrations have been determined in the human peripheral lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test in vitro. The results of treatments with Curcumin and Garlic indicated that they statistically significantly decrease the number of chromosomal aberrations and number of metaphases with aberrations induced with cisplatin, but they cannot completely protect cells from damage. The test concentrations of Curcumin (50 µg/ml) and Garlic (100 µg/ml) showed limited antimutagenic effect on cisplatin (1. 0 µg/ml and 2. 0 µg/ml) at 0, 24 and 48 hour of duration in reverse order.

40|$|Abstract: Edible oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of food and a major source of energy for human survival. It also contains saturated fats which when consumed in excess can result in developing coronary diseases. Most Ghanaian households use <b>edible</b> oils in <b>preparation</b> of their day-to-day meals. However there is a paucity of literature on the knowledge, preference and perceptions of consumers on these edible oils. Thus, the objective of the study was to ascertain consumer’s knowledge, perceptions and preference of edible oil. A cross sectional approach was used for study. Pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires were administered to 206 respondents. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0 and results presented using descriptive statistics (tables, charts, frequencies and percentages). The empirical evidence suggests that greater majority of consumers (95. 6 %) generally use refined edible oils in their daily meals. However, these consumers lack the requisite knowledge on saturated fats and unsaturated fats content of edible oils. As a result, these consumers purchased the refined edible oils because they perceived them to be healthy to consume, quality and nutritious. Moreover, unrefined edible oils were perceived to be substandard in packaging and poor in quality. Regarding the consumers preference in size, it was identified tha...|$|R

Auwahi district on East Maui extends from sea level to about 6800 feet (1790 meters) elevation at the southwest rift of leeward Haleakala volcano. In botanical references, Auwahi currently refers to a centrally located, fairly large (5400 acres) stand of diverse dry forest at 3000 - 5000 feet (915 - 1525 meters) elevation surrounded by less diverse forest and more open-statured shrubland on lava. Auwahi contains high native tree diversity with 50 dryland species, many with extremely hard, durable, and heavy wood. To early Hawaiians, forests like Auwahi must have seemed an invaluable source of unique natural materials, especially the wide variety of woods for tool making for agriculture and fishing, canoe building, kapa making, and weapons. Of the 50 species of native trees at Auwahi, 19 species (38 %) are known to have been used for medicine, 13 species (26 %) for tool-making, 13 species (26 %) for canoe building, 13 species (26 %) for house building, 8 species (16 %) for tools for making kapa, 8 species (16 %) for weapons, 8 species (16 %) for fishing, 8 species (16 %) for dyes, and 7 species (14 %) for religious purposes. Other <b>miscellaneous</b> uses include <b>edible</b> fruits or seeds, bird lime, cordage, a fish narcotizing agent, firewood, a source of "fireworks", recreation, scenting agents, poi boards, and holua sled construction. Nine species of trees (18 %) have no recorded uses. In many of these cases, the wood appears to be a good quality durable hardwood for which there were likely ethnobotanical uses despite the lack of references in the literature. Auwahi has been greatly transformed by burning, grazing, and invasion by non-native plant species. As a result, Auwahi has had much of its original native shrub and understory replaced largely by a thick mat of introduced kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum). Many native tree species produce viable seed but few seedlings are found and fewer of these survive. Since the late 1960 s, Auwahi {{has been the focus of}} protection and restoration efforts that continue to this day. Thus far efforts have had only limited success...|$|R
40|$|Tanjung Selongor and Pantai Balok (State Pahang) are {{the only}} two places known for {{spawning}} activity of the Malaysian horseshoe crab - Tachypleus gigas (Müller, 1785) on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. While the former beach has been disturbed by several anthropogenic activities that ultimately brought an end to the spawning activity of T. gigas, the status of the latter remains uncertain. In the present study, the spawning behavior of T. gigas at Pantai Balok (Sites I-III) was observed over a period of thirty six months, in three phases, between 2009 and 2013. Every year, the crab’s nesting activity was found to be high during Southwest monsoon (May–September) followed by Northeast (November–March) and Inter monsoon (April and October) periods. In the meantime, the number of female T. gigas in 2009 – 2010 (Phase- 1) was higher (38 crabs) than in 2010 – 2011 (Phase- 2 : 7 crabs) and 2012 – 2013 (Phase- 3 : 9 crabs) for which both increased overexploitation (for <b>edible</b> and fishmeal <b>preparations)</b> as well as anthropogenic disturbances in the vicinity (sand mining since 2009, land reclamation for wave breaker/parking lot constructions in 2011 and fishing jetty construction in 2013) are responsible. In this context, the physical infrastructure developments have altered the sediment close to nesting sites to be dominated by fine sand (2. 5 Xφ) with moderately-well sorted (0. 6 – 0. 7 σφ), very-coarse skewed (− 2. 4 SKφ), and extremely leptokurtic (12. 6 Kφ) properties. Also, increased concentrations of Cadmium (from 4. 2 to 13. 6 mg kg − 1) and Selenium (from 11. 5 to 23. 3 mg kg − 1) in the sediment, and Sulphide (from 21 to 28 µg l − 1) in the water were observed. In relation to the monsoonal changes affecting sheltered beach topography and sediment flux, the spawning crabs have shown a seasonal nest shifting behaviour in-between Sites I-III during 2009 – 2011. However, in 2012 – 2013, the crabs were mostly restricted to the areas (i. e., Sites I and II) with high oxygen (5. 5 – 8. 0 mg l − 1) and moisture depth (6. 2 – 10. 2 cm). In view of the sustained anthropogenic pressure on the coastal habitats on one hand and decreasing horseshoe crabs population on the other, it is crucial to implement both conservation and management measures for T. gigas at Pantai Balok. Failing that may lead to the loss of this final spawning ground on the east coast of P. Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Rice is an {{important}} dietary grain but {{may be difficult to}} fortify with water-soluble vitamins due to the losses incurred during processing and <b>preparation.</b> <b>Edible</b> coatings can offer reasonable protection against folate processing losses in fortified rice, in particular pectin (Shrestha, 2003). However, pectin, an indigestible fibre, may entrap or bind added folate, decreasing its absorption efficiency. Healthy volunteers (n= 26, 18 - 39 yrs) received oral 400 &# 956;g [13 C 5]PteGlu doses in three separate test meals in randomized cross-over trials as follows: 1) aqueous 2) 200 g white rice and 3) 200 g of pectin-coated rice premix. A plasma AUC 0 - 8 was conducted (0, 1, 2, 5 and 8 hrs postprandial). Subjects followed a low folate basal diet (112 ± 12 &# 956;g/day) - verified using L. casei microbiological assay - during the AUC and for 24 hours prior. Optimisation of the pectin-coated rice premix gave folic acid coating and cooking losses of 33. 5 % and 15. 5 % respectively. The mean test dose error per 400 &# 956;g folic acid was ± 26 &# 956;g. Single- or tri- enzyme extraction of fortified rice extracts did not significantly increase the mean assayable folate content compared to the mean folic acid content. The levels of plasma [13 C 5] 5 -methyl-THF, [13 C 5]PteGlu and 5 -methyl-THF were quantified using a validated HPLC-tandem MS method. The calibration curves indicated good response linearity in the 0 - 100 ng/mL range (R 2 > 0. 9978). Inter- and intra-assay variation of 5 -methyl-THF (100 ng/mL) was 6. 9 % (n= 6) and 5. 2 % (n= 4) respectively. The mean recovery of 5, 20 and 50 ng/mL 5 -methyl-THF in spiked plasma extracts was 98. 6 ± 8. 7 %, 89. 3 ± 2. 8 % and 92. 6 ± 3. 7 % (n= 3) respectively. Standard Reference Material- 1846, infant formula (129 ± 28 &# 956;g/ 100 g) was measured at 110 ± 15 &# 956;g folic acid/ 100 g. The relative bioavailability of the folic acid in meals 2 and 3 was measured by comparing their [13 C 5] 5 -methyl-THF AUCs relative to meal 1. The relative bioavailabilities (Mean % ± CI) of meals 2 and 3 were 86. 5 ± 4. 6 % and 68. 7 ± 5. 4 % respectively. It appears the pectin coat moderately reduces short-term folic acid bioavailability. These studies define the basis for calculating the amount of folic acid to be added to rice so that an adequate amount can be absorbed after coating and cooking losses. Pectin coatings may be a useful means of increasing the folate status of populations that rely heavily on rice as a staple...|$|R
