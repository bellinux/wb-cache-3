Zito was {{a focal point}} of the 2006 trade deadline, and was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that if the Mets were unwilling to trade Milledge, the Athletics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in Aaron Heilman and John Maine. However, Athletics' general manager Billy Beane decided to keep Zito {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} saw the {{departure}} of Hartwell {{and the addition of}} Cynthia Bailey and Phaedra Parks. The main lineup remained unchanged during the fourth season, although Marlo Hampton joined as a friend of the housewives. Whitfield exited the series upon the conclusion of the fourth season, and was replaced by Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore in the fifth season. Zolciak departed from the program {{in the middle of the}} fifth season. The departure of Zolciak made Leakes the only remaining original cast member as of season six; however, Zolciak commented that she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in returning to the series. In the seventh season, Williams became a friend of the housewives, alongside new cast member Demetria McKinney, while Claudia Jordan was introduced as a main housewife.|$|E

25|$|Various 2006 {{estimates}} {{showed that}} Russia had above 200,000 {{members of the}} FSB, or one FSB employee for every 700 citizens of Russia (the exact number of the overall FSB staff is classified). The Russian Armed Forces General Staff, {{as well as its}} subordinate structures, such as the Russian Strategic Missile Troops headquarters, are not submitted to the Federal Security Service, but the FSB <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in monitoring such structures, as they intrinsically involve state secrets and various degrees of admittance to them. The Law on Federal Security Service which defines its functions and establishes its structure does not involve such tasks as managing strategic branches of national industry, controlling political groups, or infiltrating the federal government.|$|E
25|$|A bank <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in {{minimizing}} {{the amount of}} money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|The new English {{language}} venture faced considerable {{regulatory and}} commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There {{were hundreds of}} millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The main Ultra Energy team {{immediately}} re-formed as Ballard Research, {{taking over}} offices {{directly across the}} street from the Ultra ones. Ballard started calling old contacts in the oil industry, looking for companies that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in diversifying their energy holdings. Shell was interested and kept the company afloat for a time, but dropped their interest when one of the minority shareholders held out. In mid-1981, Amoco decided to take over the rechargeable side of the company, and paid off most of the company's local debts. Now solvent, the company quickly started looking for applications for their technology, and won contracts with the Canadian Forces to further develop their single-use long-life battery. This led to a successful production line producing thousands of cells for the U.S. and Canadian militaries.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994, CDNow {{launched}} its BuyWeb program. CDNow {{had the idea}} that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} websites {{are based}} on building virtual communities that allow consumers to express their needs, wants and values, online. Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can {{keep in touch with}} individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of loyalty into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience. Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in. Through the use of new semantic analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online. An understanding of buying signals can help sales people target relevant prospects and marketers run micro-targeted campaigns.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Frost and his explosive, up-tempo offense led the Knights to a 6–7 record. UCF {{began the}} Frost era with a 38-0 shutout win over FCS {{opponent}} South Carolina State. After losing its next two to Big Ten opponents #5 Michigan in a rout and Maryland in double overtime, the Knights defeated FIU and East Carolina. Central Florida then suffered a close 26-25 loss {{due to a}} late field goal to Temple on October 15. The Knights rebounded the following week to defeat UConn by a score of 24-16. UCF suffered a defeat on October 29 to Houston, then responded with wins over Tulane and Cincinnati, gaining bowl eligibility. Frost's squad concluded the regular season with losses to Tulsa and archrival South Florida. The Knights lost to Arkansas State in the 2016 Cure Bowl by a score of 31-13. After the 2016 season, Oregon fired head coach Mark Helfrich, under whom Frost served as offensive coordinator from 2013-2015. Amidst rumors that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in the Ducks opening, Frost announced he {{was not interested in}} Oregon and that he would return as UCF's head coach in 2017. Ironically, the position eventually went to UCF's rival coach, South Florida head coach Willie Taggart.|$|E
