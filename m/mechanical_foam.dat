2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

It was won by Gack Kampmann. Due to the outbreak of World War One and the following economic crisis, the project was not completed until 1923.

50|$|In most {{industrial}} fermentations, {{the organisms}} or eukaroyotic cells are submerged in a liquid medium; in others, {{such as the}} fermentation of cocoa beans, coffee cherries, and miso, fermentation takes place on the moist surface of the medium.There are also industrial considerations related to the fermentation process. For instance, to avoid biological process contamination, the fermentation medium, air, and equipment are sterilized. Foam control {{can be achieved by}} either <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> destruction or chemical anti-foaming agents. Several other factors must be measured and controlled such as pressure, temperature, agitator shaft power, and viscosity. An important element for industrial fermentations is scale up. This is the conversion of a laboratory procedure to an industrial process. It is well established in the field of industrial microbiology that what works well at the laboratory scale may work poorly or not at all when first attempted at large scale. It is generally not possible to take fermentation conditions that have worked in the laboratory and blindly apply them to industrial-scale equipment. Although many parameters have been tested for use as scale up criteria, there is no general formula because of the variation in fermentation processes. The most important methods are the maintenance of constant power consumption per unit of broth and the maintenance of constant volumetric transfer rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} is trapped by the foam {{stabilizer}} and creates a thick foam which will float on top of hydrocarbon fuels and seal off access to atmospheric oxygen, smothering the fire. Chemical foam was unsuitable for use on polar solvents such as alcohol, as the fuel would mix with and break down the foam blanket. The carbon dioxide generated also served to propel the foam out of the container, be it a portable fire extinguisher or fixed installation using hoselines. Chemical foam is considered obsolete in the United States and {{has been replaced by}} synthetic <b>mechanical</b> <b>foams,</b> such as AFFF which have a longer shelf life, are more effective, and more versatile, although some countries such as Japan and India continue to use it.|$|R

The gelation of an aqueous slurry of glass powders was not achieved according to the polymerization of an organic monomer, but {{as the result of}} alkali activation. The alkali activation of a Ca-Mg silicate glass (with a composition close to 50 mol % wollastonite— 50 mol % diopside, with minor amounts of Na 2 O and P 2 O 5) allowed for the obtainment of well-dispersed concentrated suspensions, undergoing progressive hardening by curing at low temperature (40 °C), owing to the formation of a C–S–H (calcium silicate hydrate) gel.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{practice}} in the foam destruction {{is the use of}} antifoam chemicals and <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> breaking devices. However, these steps add to the complexity as well as cost of the downstream process and are insufficient for foam destruction in vigorously foaming biosurfactant systems (Winterburn and Martin 2012). Research efforts regarding biosurfactant production processes have been directed towards development of more effective downstream processes. For this reason, there is an interest in utilizing controlled foaming in biosurfactant fermentation systems through the application of foam separation techniques (Chen et al. 2006 a). One of the emerging technologies applied for this purpose leverages the native partitioning of surface active compounds into foam fractions during fermentation processes and is termed the foam fractionation method. Foam fractionation is a process whereby dissolved or colloidal material is selectively adsorbed on the surface of rising bubbles and then is partially segregated by the foam (Lemlich 1972).|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} presented {{of the mechanical}} properties of low-density open-cell polymer foams subjected to large deformations. The foams are modelled as three-dimensional frameworks of slender struts. Regular as well as random foams are analyzed, where the latter are generated using the Voronoi technique. The macroscopic mechanical properties are determined for various types of struts properties through unit-cell analyses containing many foam cells per unit-cell. The computations make use of standard Finite Element (FE) techniques. Bending of the struts dominates the <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> response at low strains. Axial deformation of the struts becomes the dominant mechanism at larger tensile strains. Strut buckling becomes the main mechanism at larger compressive strains, and causes {{a significant decrease in}} load carrying capacity of the foam. The large strain mechanical behavior of foams is found to be dependent on the weakest cross-section of the foam appearing in the random foam structure, the so-called "minimum effective cross-section". The minimum effective cross-section determines the tangential foam modulus at large tensile strains. Regular foam structures have a uniform unit-cell cross-section and, as a result, a higher minimum effective cross-section than regular foam structures and, therefore, a higher tangent modulus in the large strain range. ...|$|E

Incompressible hyperelasticity was applied to the rubber matrix. The material parameters of hyperelasticity for rubber matrix were identified by the biaxial tensile test results.

40|$|The {{potentialities}} for the {{intensification of}} the process of lipase production by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica on a renewable hydrophobic substrate (methyloleate) have been investigated. The key factor governing the lipase yield is {{the intensification of}} the oxygen transfer rate, considering the fact that Y. lipolytica is a strict aerobe. However, considering the nature of the substrate and the capacity for protein excretion and biosurfactant production of Y. lipolytica, intensification of oxygen transfer rate is accompanied by an excessive formation of foam. Two different foam control strategies have thus been implemented: a classical chemical foam control strategy (CFM) and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> control (MFM) based on the Stirring As Foam Disruption (SAFD) principle. The second strategy allows foam control without any modifications of the physico-chemical properties of the broth. However, the MFM system design induced the formation of a persistent foam layer in the bioreactor. This phenomenon has led to the segregation of microbial cells between the foam phase and the liquid phase {{in the case of the}} bioreactors operated with MFM control, and induced a reduction at the level of the lipase yield. More interestingly, flow cytometry experiments have shown that residence time of microbial cells in the foam phase tends to induce a dimorphic transition which could potentially explain the reduction of lipase excretion.

The de-emulsified wool wax, which is recalcitrant to biodegradation, can then be readily removed by centrifugation. In 12 -day batch experiments, 97 % of wool wax and 87 % of COD were removed after gentle centrifuging at 200 x g, compared to only 6 % and 8 %, respectively, for sterile controls. Steady-state chemostat experiments under optimum conditions gave essentially complete removal of wool wax and 90 % removal of COD at less than 40 h retention time, and demonstrated that the mechanism of pollutant removal was by bioflocculation rather than aerobic degradation. At 100 L pilot scale, 95 % of wool wax and 82 % of COD were consistently removed over a period of 116 days of continuous operation at 38 h retention time and 30 °C, producing a spadable sludge of 5. 7 mL/g.

40|$|Surfactants are {{chemical}} compounds that {{are able to}} alter interfacial properties, particularly surface tension. When they are biologically produced, the term biosurfactant is used. One of the most important groups of biosurfactants is a family of {{chemical compounds}} known as glycolipids, whose structure consists of a sugar group and a lipid tail. Glycolipids are subdivided into three main groups: rhamnolipids, sophorolipids and trehalolipids, named following their sugar moieties, respectively rhamnose, trehalose and sophorose. Biosurfactants exhibit attractive advantages over chemical surfactants. Examples of these are biodegradability, low toxicity, and effectiveness at extreme temperature, pH and salinity. The objective of the present research project was, first, to investigate the potential of liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons to induce biosurfactant production by the bacterium Ps. aeruginosa 2 Bf isolated based on its ability to metabolise alkanes. The second objective was to optimise biosurfactant production using alkanes as sole carbon and energy source, through optimising the mixing & aeration conditions, media conditions as well as provision of alkane, in a stirred tank batch reactor system. The final objective was to describe the biosurfactant formed. Experiments were organised in three major series: the exploratory shake flask based experiments, the bioreactor-based experiments to optimise biosurfactant production and characterise biokinetics and performance, and the biosurfactant characterisation experiments. Following review of a number of methods, microbial cell counts were selected as the most reproducible measure of biomass formation in the presence of alkanes. The presence of biosurfactant was quantified functionally in terms of the emulsification index and alteration of surface tension. Using a shake flask-based study, nitrogen source was investigated in terms of biomass and biosurfactant synthesis. Four pre-selected nitrogen sources were tested in order to select the best for bioreactor based study. These nitrogen sources consisted of specific combinations of three nitrogen compounds, NH 4 NO 3, NaNO 3 and (NH 4) 2 SO 4. During the study, long chain liquid n-alkanes were used as sole carbon source and the C/N ratio maintained at the value of 18. 6 in mass terms. Results confirmed that both a combination of NO 3 ' and NH 4 + ions or a nitrogen source composed solely of NH 4 + ions were suitable for biomass growth and biosurfactant production. (NH 4) SO 4 was used as the N-source of choice in the remainder of the study. While the C 14 -C 17 alkanes cut was the carbon source of interest in the study, two pure alkanes, n-C 12 and n-C 16 were tested and compared to the C 14 -C 17 blend. The C 14 -C 17 fraction, sourced as an industrial byproduct, compared favourably as a carbon source with respect to hexadecane and dodecane. ii Biosurfactant production was not observed in Ps. aeruginosa 2 Bf cultures where glucose was the sole carbon source and the bacteria were not previously exposed to linear alkanes. Using a mixed carbon source of glucose and alkane, or on pre-exposure of the bacteria to alkane, biosurfactant production was induced. Induction was optimised where alkane was the sole carbon source over a period of four sub-culture steps. In the quantitative optimisation of biosurfactant production through the bioreactor based study, mixing and aeration were optimised; agitation and aeration proved to be equally important, the first at intermediate rates, the second at lower rates. Their interaction, when maximum biomass was used as the variable for response, was found to be important for agitation rates up to 500 rpm. Beyond this range of agitation speed, the interaction between aeration and agitation became negligible. In the case of Eindex as the variable for response, similar results were obtained with regard to the impact of the interaction between aeration and agitation on the process. It was significant from lower to intermediate agitation rates, and negligible from intermediate to higher rates of agitation. Lower aeration rate was found to enhance the oxygen utilisation rate, while mass transfer was relatively favoured by high aeration rate. Regarding the emulsification power of the product, quantitative tests were carried out on culture suspension, supernatant prepared by centrifugation and supernatant prepared by centrifugation and filtration at 0. 22 Î&frac 14;m pore size filters. Results showed that some emulsification effect was lost through centrifugation and filtration. This loss of emulsification effect was more pronounced in the filtration case, thus showing that some biosurfactant was removed along some other material or substance through sticking on filter paper. Foam control was required, and two <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> breakers were compared to anti-foam reagent. It was experimentally established that <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> breakers are preferable to chemical anti-foam reagents. On comparing the two different <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> breakers, the modified two blade paddle with three slits, FB- 2, performed better than the simple two blade paddle foam breaker, FB- 1. Further investigations showed that the interaction between type of foam control and agitation rate was negligible throughout the process. The Biosurfactant was characterised at the structural level and the antibiotic potential of Ps. aeruginosa 2 Bf's biosurfactant was analysed. In addition to the thin layer chromatography, three different spectroscopic methods (mass, infrared & nuclear magnetic resonance) were used to study the chemical structure of the biosurfactant produced. Up to six rhamnolipid structures were tentatively identified with spectrometric analysis whereas only four to five structures could be detected with thin layer chromatography.

40|$|Foam {{spraying}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} droplet spraying for the treatment of surfaces. It is generally assumed that aerosol exposure is considerably smaller for foam sprays compared to conventional droplet mists. This especially refers to the application of biocides in the occupational section, e. g. the disinfection in the food industry {{as well as in the}} consumer section, especially for cosmetics and household cleaning agents ("convenience products"). While there is a well-developed quantitative understanding on the physical and technical parameters determining the exposure risk when using droplet sprays, the characterization of potential aerosol exposure for the application of foams has received little attention so far. In this study the current state of knowledge on the use of foam sprays for biocide application was surveyed from the literature. In addition some exploratory aerosol measurements were carried out for typical biocide products to compare aerosol release from foam and droplet spraying. More than 55 biocidal substances, such as QAV or peracidic products as well as pyrethrins and courmarins comprising products for disinfection, insecticides and rodenticides, are used in foams. The foaming technologies can be classified as <b>mechanical</b> <b>foam</b> generation using low and high pressure and blowing agent foam generation. Since no information on aerosol formation during foam spraying was found in the literature, exploratory aerosol measurements were performed in a laboratory set-up. A reduction of a factor of three was determined for aerosol release in the three health-related size fractions (respirable, thoracic, inhalable), when the biocidal product was sprayed as a foam compared to droplet spraying. Generation of semi-solid, highly-viscous foams using physical blowing agents lowered aerosol formation more than hundred fold. The experiments show that aerosol exposure cannot generally be ruled out when using foams but increasing foam viscosity seems to reduce aerosol release. Thus, further investigations should specify to what extent foam could be explained by physical chemical data of biocidal products by using specific application techniques. These factor determine not only the primary aerosol inhalation exposure but also the risk for exposure and mobility of the environment.

Prawn pond effluents were characterised by watercolour and dominance of phytoplankton species. Three effluent types were tested, namely 1) particulate-rich effluent with little apparent phytoplankton, 2) green mircoalgal bloom predominately made up of single celled phytoplankton, and 3) brown microalgal bloom with higher prevalence of diatoms. The effluent types were similar (P> 0. 05) in non-volatile particulate material, and nitrate/nitrite but varied from each other in the following ways: 1) The particulate-rich effluents were lower (P< 0. 05) in volatile solids (compared to brown blooms), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus and chlorophyll a (compared to both green and brown blooms). 2) The brown blooms were higher (P< 0. 05) in ammonia (compared to green blooms), total nitrogen and total phosphorus (compared to both green and particulate-rich effluent), but were lower (P< 0. 05) in inorganic phosphorus (compared to both green and particulate-rich effluent). 3) The green blooms were higher (P< 0. 05) in dissolved (both organic and inorganic) phosphorus (compared to both brown and particulate-rich effluents). Although the effluent types varied significantly in these aspects {{the effect of}} the Skim treatment was similar for all parameters measured except total phosphorus. Bloom type and Skim-treatment period significantly (P< 0. 05) affected total Kjeldahl phosphorus concentrations. For all effluent types there was a continuous significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in total Kjeldahl phosphorus during the initial 6 -hour treatment period. Levels of total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids in all effluent types were significantly (P 0. 05) affected by the Skim unit in any bloom type during the initial 6 hours of testing. Nevertheless, non-significant nitrogen reductions did occur. Foam production by the Skim unit varied with different blooms, resulting in different concentrate volumes and different end points for separate experiments. Concentrate volumes were generally high for the particulate-rich and green blooms (175 – 370 litres) and low for the brown blooms (25 – 80 litres). This was due to the low tendency of the brown bloom to produce foam. This generated higher nutrient concentrations in the associated condensed foam, but may have limited the treatment efficiency. The results suggest that in this application, the Skim unit did not remove micro-algae as effectively as was anticipated. However, it was effective at removing other suspended solids. Considering these attributes and the other uses of this machinery documented by the manufactures, the unit’s oxygenation mixing capacities coupled with inorganic solids removal may provide a suitable mechanism for construction of a continuously mixed bioreactor that utilises the filtration and profit making abilities of bivalves...|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{ordinary}} concrete, foam concrete possesses advantages such as lightweight, heat insulation, etc., but the internal bubbles have of great influence on its strength. This {{study examined the}} impact of polypropylene fibers on <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>foam</b> concrete using flexural deformation control method and obtained complete load-deformation curve. The results show that, polypropylene fibers significantly affect the compressive property of the foam concrete and improve the carrying capacity after the peak compression load, but have {{little effect on the}} compressive strength; polypropylene fibers improve the flexural performance significantly...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of metallic foams based on tin-lead alloy (with 50 % of tin content) by the liquid metal infiltration process. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed at room temperature in order to study <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>foams</b> of different relative density and cell size. The samples were concurrently characterized on a microscopic scale (metallography and hardness) in order to link the morphological and mechanical characteristics of the constitutive phases.

The rearing/experimental system consisted of 9 rectangular glass tanks (0.4  m.− 2 bottom area and a total water volume 250 L per tank). All tanks were connected to a recirculation aquaculture system equipped with a <b>mechanical</b> filter (<b>foam</b> matt), a moving bed filter and a UV unit. Conditions were maintained as follows: (photoperiod 12 L: 12 D; dissolved oxygen >  84 %; temperature 21.6  ±  0.7  °C; total ammonia nitrogen <  0.14  mg L− 1; nitrite nitrogen <  0.31  mg L− 1 and nitrate nitrogen <  201.78  mg L− 1). The pH was kept above 6.18 except for one day where the pH was at 5.57. The pH was controlled by periodically adding sodium bicarbonate to the system.|$|R
