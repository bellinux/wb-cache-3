40|$|<b>Man-portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>systems</b> have {{received}} increasing political attention in recent years, {{because of the}} demonstrable risk that they pose to both mili-tary and civilian aircraft. They have been catalogued {{in some of the}} most poorly secured national stockpiles. In many more cases, questions remain about their numbers and the security measures in place to protect them from diversion. Because of the threat they pose and the fact that they have become a highly politicized issue, MANPADS have been one of the driving forces be-hind a number of international initiatives to secure, stabilize, or destroy sur-plus stocks. Although MANPADS remain a problem in their own right, they have helped focus the lens of international scrutiny on the dangers associated with surpluses of all varieties of conventional munitions. The problem with MANPADS MANPADS pose no greater risk from the perspective of stability and safety than any other light weapon. Explosive risk is generally perceived to be small in comparison to larger weapons systems. Their chief danger lies in their po-tential for diversion from national stockpiles (CHAPTER 15). The weapons are attractive to non-state actors because they offer a means to reduce power asymmetries between themselves and conventional state forces. As Table 12. 1 illustrates, the majority of recent attacks have been against military tar-gets. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of over 150 people and the loss of assets and transport-associated revenues worth hundreds of millions of dollars...|$|R
40|$|<b>Man-portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>systems</b> (MANPADS) are {{short-range}} surfaceto-air missile systems 1 {{intended for}} attacking and defending against low-flying aircraft. Some are crew-served (known sometimes as CREWPADS), {{but most are}} easily handled by a single individual and are shoulder-launched. MANPADS are generally categorized according to their guidance systems: passive infrared (IR) seekers, radio command line-of-sight (CLOS), and laser-beam riders. 2 Initial models of IRseeking missiles could engage a target at altitudes of around 2, 000 – 3, 000 m and from slant ranges 3 of about 4, 000 m (Jane’s, 2006, pp. 3 – 50; 1985, pp. 132 – 37). They were often inaccurate and susceptible to basic countermeasures. Moreover, most could engage aircraft only from behind. Today’s most advanced MANPADS can effectively engage aircraft at ranges of up to 8, 000 m (5 miles) and from multiple directions (Saab, n. d.). Initial development of MANPADS began in the 1950 s. Anti-aircraft guns from the Second World War were of limited use, and consumed vast quantities of ammunition, against increasingly fast jet aircraft. The United States developed the Redeye—which got {{its name from the}} infrared homing device in its nose—over {{the better part of a}} decade, and it entered into production in the mid- 1960 s (Parsch, 2002). The Soviets fielded their own system—the Strela- 2 (also known as the SA- 7, which is used here, or Grail) —in 1968. 4 Both were ‘tail-chase’ systems effective only when fired at the target from behind. By the end of the 1960 s only these two countries produced MANPADS, although Sweden and the United Kingdom had undertaken research and development of indigenous weapons. The 1970 s saw a significant expansion of the industry. The United States began development of the Stinger missile system in 1972 (Parsch, 2002) and production began in 1979 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 43). Work on the Soviet Strela- 3 (SA- 14 Gremlin) began in 1968, and it entered service six years later in 1974 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 30). Like their predecessors, these systems were IR-seeking missiles, but they were able to engage targets from multiple directions (not just from behind). Second-generation IR seekers also achieved a greater effective range and accuracy. The British Blowpipe system was based on radio CLOS technology, while the Swedish RBS- 70 uses a laser beam-ridin...|$|R
