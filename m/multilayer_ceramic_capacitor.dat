The dispersion state and viscosity of PAA-NH 4 -added PZT aqueous slurries strongly depended on the slurry pH. Well-dispersed PZT slurries with negligibly small Pb 2 + dissolution were obtained in the alkaline side due to the electrostatic steric hindrance effect of adsorbed polyelectrolyte dispersant molecules with a high dissociation ratio of carboxylic acid groups.

This unique configuration results in enhanced voltage and ESD performance over standard capacitor designs while allowing for a fail-open condition if mechanically damaged (cracked). If damaged, the device may experience a drop in capacitance but a short is unlikely. The FE-CAP is designed to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a low IR or short circuit condition and the chance for a catastrophic and potentially costly failure event. Driven by the demand for a more robust and reliable component, the FE-CAP was designed for critical applications where higher operating temperatures and mechanical stress are a concern.

A MLCC stacking machine is a core process of defining a quality of products. It is known that unparalleled upper and lower plates in a pressing step might cause MLCC misalignment.

40|$|The {{substitution}} in (Ba 0. 70 Sr 0. 30) TiO 3 {{thin films}} by the rare-earth element dysprosium prepared at 1000 °C by chemical solution deposition on nickel foils was investigated. The relatively large thermal budget applied (via annealing temperature) {{is shown to}} enhance the solubility of the Dy 3 +doping ion into the crystal lattice of the perovskite films. Preference for B-site occupancy of this amphoteric cation was further promoted {{by the addition of}} BaO excess (1 mol%), which results in slightly larger grains in the films as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Despite this Ba-rich composition, the presence of secondary phases in the thin films was not detected by X-ray diffraction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed no evidence for local segregation of Dy at grain boundaries, neither the formation of NiO at the interface between the film and the metal foil was observed. The substitution of Ti 4 + by Dy 3 + leads to the formation of strong electron acceptors in the system, which balance the number of ionized oxygen vacancies arisen from the reductive crystallization atmosphere used during processing. As a consequence, the dielectric loss (tan σ) and leakage conduction measured in the resulting thin-film capacitors were significantly reduced with respect to nominally undoped samples.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{electronic}} component industry {{has led to a}} demand for miniatured <b>multilayer</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> (MLCC), where BaTiO 3 is used due to its superior frequency characteristics, higher reliability, high breakdown voltage, excellent volumetric efficiency of the capacitance and reduced cost. MLCCs with a dielectric thickness of 2 µm have already been commercialized but the next generation components demand a thickness of 1 µm. Such requirement demands dielectric powders with uniform composition and size distribution, and weak agglomeration to allow low temperature sintering with minimum grain growth. Various methods of preparation of BaTiO 3 is available in the literature. The solid state route needs high calcinations temperature to get perovskite phase and often results in the formation of multiphase and inhomogeneous powders. High energy ball milling is also reported to produce 10 nm particle size but the approach suffers from small batch size, high processing time and energy consumption.

A conductive silver epoxy is utilized between the base metal and nickel barrier layers of KEMET’s standard termination system {{in order to establish}} pliability while maintaining terminal strength, solderability and electrical performance. This technology was developed in order to address the primary failure mode of MLCCs – flex cracks, which are typically the result of excessive tensile and shear stresses produced during board flexure and thermal cycling. Flexible termination technology inhibits the transfer of board stress to the rigid ceramic body, therefore mitigating flex cracks which can result in low IR or short circuit failures. Although this technology does not eliminate the potential for mechanical damage that may propagate during extreme environmental and handling conditions, it does provide superior flex performance over standard termination systems. FT-CAP complements KEMET’s Open Mode, Floating Electrode (FE-CAP), Floating Electrode with Flexible Termination (FF-CAP) and KEMET Power Solutions (KPS) product lines by providing a complete portfolio of flex mitigation solutions. Combined with the stability of an X 7 R dielectric and designed to accommodate all capacitance requirements, these flex-robust devices are RoHS-compliant, offer up to 5 mm of flex-bend capability and exhibit a predictable change in capacitance with respect to time and voltage.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the electrocaloric effect has gained the {{substantial}} interest of researchers due to its potential applications in commercial cooling. The high theoretical effciency of electro-thermal conversion places this phenomenon as a potential alternative to commercial vapour-compression refrigerators. Success in such solid state cooling is anticipated to lead to global scale energy savings and reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. Most of the focus has been directed towards the achievement of high values of the electrocaloric effect temperature change ∆T EC. High values of around 10 K and more have been reported. However {{little attention has been}} given to the methods of measurements and their uncertainties. This work aims to use a metrological approach to study the electrocaloric phenomenon, to compare certain methods and to explore these measurements and their uncertainties. There are various ways to quantify the electrocaloric effect and various parameters infuence the direct measurements of ∆T EC. Here a direct method using infrared imaging is employed for the spatial and time-resolved temperature measurements of electrocaloric bodies. A set of the parameters infuencing the∆T EC is determined. Based on these quantifed contributions, an uncertainty for such measurements is reported. The calibration of the imager is performed to validate the traceability of measurements, and a further set of characterisation apparatus was implemented to establish its performance. A bulk Ba 0. 65 Sr 0. 35 TiO 3 sample was employed as a cross reference specimen in an inter-laboratory comparison involving infrared imaging and two types of differential scanning calorimetry.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this presentation is to gain insight into possible failure mechanisms in BaTiO 3 -based ceramic capacitors that {{may be associated with}} the reliability degradation that accompanies a reduction in dielectric thickness, as reported by Intel Corporation in 2010. The volumetric efficiency (microF/cm 3) of a <b>multilayer</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> (MLCC) has been shown to not increase limitlessly due to the grain size effect on the dielectric constant of ferroelectric ceramic BaTiO 3 material. The reliability of an MLCC has been discussed with respect to its structure. The MLCCs with higher numbers of dielectric layers will pose more challenges for the reliability of dielectric material, which is the case for most base-metal-electrode (BME) capacitors. A number of MLCCs manufactured using both precious-metal-electrode (PME) and BME technology, with 25 V rating and various chip sizes and capacitances, were tested at accelerated stress levels. Most of these MLCCs had a failure behavior with two mixed failure modes: the well-known rapid dielectric wearout, and so-called 'early failures. " The two failure modes can be distinguished when the testing data were presented and normalized at use-level using a 2 -parameter Weibull plot. The early failures had a slope parameter of Beta > 1, indicating that the early failures are not infant mortalities. Early failures are triggered due to external electrical overstress and become dominant as dielectric layer thickness decreases, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in reliability. This indicates that early failures are the main cause of the reliability degradation in MLCCs as dielectric layer thickness decreases. All of the early failures are characterized by an avalanche-like breakdown leakage current. The failures have been attributed to the extrinsic minor construction defects introduced during fabrication of the capacitors. A reliability model including dielectric thickness and extrinsic defect feature size is proposed in this presentation. The model can be used to explain the Intel-reported reliability degradation in MLCCs with respect to the reduction of dielectric thickness. It {{can also be used to}} estimate the reliability of a MLCC based on its construction and microstructure parameters such as dielectric thickness, average grain size, and number of dielectric layers. Measures for preventing early failures are also discussed in this document...|$|E

40|$|Electronic devices like notebooks, smart phones, GPS units, LED TVs {{and other}} daily life {{applications}} are produced with increased functionality and complexity {{from year to}} year. Today’s electronic devices must be equipped with new smart electronic circuitry designs to add more functionality within a single device, while not making them larger in size. As the electronic circuits are made of various components, active semiconducting chips and passive components, like resistors, capacitors and inductors, more and more components are needed per single unit. While the number of components increases all components are subject to miniaturization to increase the volume efficiency. As capacitors {{are one of the}} more important passive components and every device consists of more than one hundred capacitors, a lot of effort is put on developing smaller sized capacitors. Capacitors can be made {{from a wide variety of}} dielectrics and the components can have various shapes. The majority are surface mount capacitors and especially multilayer ceramic capacitors are one of the more popular types. These multilayer ceramic capacitors are mainly used in today’s electronic devices and these types of capacitors are discussed in this thesis. As the name <b>multilayer</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> already suggests the components are made up of a body, in which alternating layers of dielectrics and conducting metal electrodes are embedded. In Chapter 2 the manufacturing of multilayer ceramic capacitors is explained in more detail. In the 1980 s and 1990 s the majority of multilayer capacitors were made with expensive noble metals like palladium or platinum. Due to the price increase of these noble metals at the end of the 20 th century, the passive component industry started to develop new dielectric materials suitable for co-firing with less expensive noble metals like pure silver or silverpalladium alloys. Another way to decrease metal costs is to implement base metals like nickel and copper as electrode material. Therefore new types of dielectric materials had to be developed in order to be co-fired with nickel or copper in a reducing atmosphere to prevent the metals from oxidizing. Multilayer ceramic capacitors can be made of a wide variety of materials and depending on the electrical characteristics they are employed in different applications. This thesis describes dielectrics, personally developed for use in commercial multilayer capacitors, which show high stability towards temperature, frequency and voltage in Chapter 3. These dielectrics have low or moderate permittivity values and they are primarily used for filtering, smoothing and temperature control applications. Chapter 3 also describes multilayer capacitors having relatively high permittivities. These are based on barium-neodymiumtitanates and zinc-magnesium-titanates. These materials are suitable for co-firing with pure silver or silver-palladium alloys. It is described how to modify the dielectric composition in order to co-fire with high silver content electrodes and which strategy has to be followed in order to get reliable multilayer capacitors. Furthermore, it is described how high-permittivity temperature stable capacitors having copper electrodes can be produced. These types of dielectrics have very low equivalent series resistance characteristics. Such capacitors can be used in high frequency applications especially. Various multilayer capacitors with electrodes of silver-palladium alloys, copper and nickel electrodes were made. The equivalent series resistance characteristics were determined to compare these capacitors with respect to their performance at high frequencies. Multilayer capacitors with the lowest equivalent series resistances are obtained when metals having the lowest possible bulk resistivity, like copper or silver, are selected. The second part, Chapter 4, describes multilayer capacitors that are used for decoupling and bypassing purposes in electronic circuitry. These capacitors consist of dielectrics which are based on modified ferroelectric barium titanates. Typically they have very high permittivity values. They are less stable towards temperature changes, but they are important for their high capacitive volume efficiency. The multilayer ceramic capacitors are already produced with low cost metals, in particular nickel electrodes. Development is mainly focused on increasing the capacitive volume efficiency by decreasing the dielectric layer thickness and by maximizing the number of electrodes layers. Various strategies are described to make high capacitance multilayer capacitors. The dielectrics layers of these high capacitance multilayer capacitors were already decreased down to 1 μm thickness in recent years. The grain size of the ceramics is typically 200 – 250 nm and efforts are made to decrease the grain size further, while maintaining reliable capacitor characteristics. The influence of the applied electrical field on the dielectric layers is explained in this chapter, and a strategy is presented how to develop new high permittivity dielectrics effectively. The influence of raw materials properties, particle size distribution of raw materials, and formulation on electrical properties and microstructures of the ceramics is described, while a conventional production method is used. With an alternative method it is possible to make ceramics having high permittivity values as well. In that process raw materials are used, which have high concentrations of yttrium oxide and copper oxide in the barium titanate lattice. These doped barium titanate powders are then mixed with pure barium titanate powders, together with extra dopant elements, to produce a new type of dielectrics...|$|E
