40|$|Abstract Introduction Insulin allergy {{to human}} insulin {{preparations}} during {{the treatment of}} diabetes is suggested to occur at rates ranging from Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 12 -year-old Caucasian girl with localized allergy to the insulin excipient <b>metacresol,</b> and the subsequent desensitization therapy using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with simultaneous intravenous insulin infusion. Conclusions This is the first documented case of allergy to the <b>metacresol</b> component of insulin in the pediatric type 1 diabetes literature. We describe an approach to diagnosis and management of <b>metacresol</b> allergy in type 1 diabetes. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a 30 -year-old man, with type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus, who developed generalized allergy to insulin consisting of several bouts of tremor, tachycardia, breathlessness and syncope. Strong positive reactions to protamine and <b>metacresol</b> were demonstrated by skin-prick testing. Symptoms persisted despite the use of antihistamine therapy, Actrapid HM Paraben and Monotard (insulin without protamine and <b>metacresol)</b> and immunosuppression (tacrolimus). He underwent a cadaver pancreas transplantation with portal-enteric drainage in June 2003. Following the antithymocyte globulin induction, immunosuppression consisted in tacrolimus and sirolimus without steroids. The patient subsequently reported a complete resolution of his symptoms and excellent glycaemic control. Thirteen months after transplantation, the patient developed oral ulcerations and severe leucopoenia initially attributed to sirolimus, which was subsequently stopped. A hyperglycaemic episode following corticosteroid therapy for acute rejection therapy required the reintroduction of insulin. Allergic manifestations reappeared promptly. Currently, 2 years after transplantation, the patient is euglycaemic without insulin (glycated haemoglobin 5. 8 %) and he is free of allergic reactions...|$|E

Phenol, ortho-and para-cresol can be titrated at concentrations larger than about 5 x 10 - 5 M.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 29 -year-old man with a 14 -year history of type 1 diabetes, normal renal function, and mild {{diabetic}} retinopathy. The patient progressively developed a generalized allergic reaction to two insulin excipients [...] protamine and <b>metacresol</b> [...] with systemic manifestations of tremor, tachycardia, vertigo, shortness of breath, and short episodes of unconsciousness causing him to be out of work. In June 2003, he received a vascularized cadaveric pancreas transplant using induction with polyclonal antibodies along with tacrolimus and sirolimus but without steroids. A hyperglycemic episode following corticosteroid therapy for rejection treatment required reintroduction of insulin therapy with prompt reappearance of allergic manifestations. Now, the patient is euglycemic without insulin or allergic manifestations and a glycated hemoglobin of 6. 4 %...|$|E

Three simple and sensitive spectrophotometric methods are {{proposed for the}} determination of atenolol (ATN) in bulk drug and tablets. The methods {{are based on the}} bromination of ATN by the bromine generated in situ by the action of the acid on the bromate–bromide mixture followed by the determination of unreacted bromine by reacting with a fixed amount of either <b>metacresol</b> purple (MCP) and measuring the absorbance at 540 nm (method A) and 445 nm (method B) or erioglaucine (EGC) and measuring the absorbance at 630 nm (method C). Beer’s law is valid within the concentration ranges of 1. 0 – 20. 0, 2. 0 – 40. 0 and 1. 0 – 8. 0 μg/mL for method A, method B and method C, respectively. The calculated molar absorptivities were found to be 1. 20 × 10 4, 4. 51 × 10 3 and 3. 46 × 10 4 L/mol · cm for method A, method B and method C, respectively. Sandell’s sensitivity values, correlation coefficients, limits of detection and quantification are also reported. Recovery results were statistically compared with those of a reference method by applying Student’s t-andF-test. The novelty of the present study is the measurement of two different colors using MCP, that is, red-pink color of MCP in acid medium at 540 nm and yellowish-orange color of brominated MCP at 445 nm. 1...|$|E
