50|$|Duct {{segments}} {{are typically}} separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen {{to separate the}} duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than <b>metal</b> <b>joints.</b> Also <b>metal</b> <b>joints</b> place an additional loads onto duct segments. <b>Metal</b> <b>joints</b> prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments. fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of <b>joint</b> (2010). <b>Metal</b> <b>joints</b> can cost twice this amount.|$|R

The management at Vikom Industry {{had said that}} they were unable to provide single-piece components and offered components that would be assembled out of two halves, but which would be just as strong as the ones ordered. Therefore, according to Kubs, Vikom Industry is solely responsible for the component and bolt force and strength calculations. Vladislavs Podgurskis, a {{representative of}} Vikom Industry, said in response that all metal components were made and assembled strictly according to the building design and that it must be a design error.|$|E

In the present study, stainless steel of grades 202, 304, 310 and 316 were welded with mild steel by Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) and Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding processes. The percentage dilutions of joints were calculated and tensile strength of dissimilar <b>metal</b> <b>joints</b> was investigated.

5000|$|Xiao {{are today}} most often pitched {{in the key}} of G (with the D above middle C being the lowest note, with all fingers covered), {{although}} xiao in other less common keys are also available, most commonly in the key of F. More traditional xiao have six finger holes, while most modern ones have eight; the additional holes do not extend the instrument's range but instead {{make it easier to}} play notes such as F natural. There are a further four (sometimes two or six) sound holes situated at the bottom third of the length of the xiao. The blowing hole is at the top end, it may be cut into a 'U' shape, a [...] "V" [...] shape, or at an angle (with or without bone/ivory inlay.) Some xiao have the blowing end entirely cut off, so the player must use the space between their chin and lips to cover the hole fully. There may be a <b>metal</b> <b>joint</b> between the blow hole and the top finger hole for tuning purposes and sometimes also between the last finger hole and the end. The length of the xiao ranges from around 45 cm to over 1.25 m but is usually around 75-85 cm. Usually, shorter xiaos are more difficult to play because of the need to control one's breath more accurately. The angle to play the xiao is around 45 degrees from the body.|$|E
50|$|Pelsi tsässon is a small, square one-storied stone {{building}} with a gable roof, the dimensions of which are 676 x 511 cm. The building has one interior room (14.5 m2) and an open entrance-room (5.9 m2). The walls of tsässon are made from granite stones and bricks, bound together by lime-mortar and decorated. The thickness of the walls is 70-80 cm. There are different ornaments and initials (that could belong to the builder) on the small stones stowed inside the outer wall mortar. The renovation {{done in the last}} few years has somewhat changed the exterior look of the building. If it used to be a {{building with}} an extended shelter above the entrance, now an entrance-room with a roof that supports on strong posts has been added to it. The entrance-room has a beam fence and vertical boarding barrier and a gate. There used to be a shelter without sides in front of the tsässon that was supported by two angled posts. The height of the building from the foundation up to where the rafter and the wall unite is 240 cm and the height up to the ridge is 465 cm. At the moment, the building has a spindle-tin roof. From a 1970s photograph, it can be seen that at that time, the roof of the tsässon was made from shingles. The walls of the building on the inside are of granite stones bound together with lime-mortar and of brick finishing. There have been cracks in the walls, mended by cement-based mixture. To stop the building from falling apart, the inner walls have had <b>metal</b> <b>joint</b> fasteners in them that have been removed by now. The size for the door opening is 116 x 180 cm. The vertical supporting posts have been installed inside the walls. The boards fixed on the crosspiece by fishtail tenon have 57 cm forged hinges. The door dimensions are 96 x 170 cm. The door is made from four wide boards. The size of the window is 66 x 80 cm. The wooden jamb is old and has a simple wooden window with four panes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{residual}} stresses developed during brazing {{on the performance of}} brazed ceramic <b>metal</b> <b>joints.</b> The thermal expansion gradient between ceramic and metallic materials leads to the development of such stresses during the cooling phase of the brazing process, which consequently reduce the strength of these composite structures. Here, the objective is to compare the failure behaviour of various assemblies observed during experimental tests and obtained through numerical simulations. In order to get a representation consistent with the physical mechanisms involved, these simulations must account for the brazing phase giving rise to residual stresses before applying in use solicitations to brazed joints. This paper focuses on the tensile strength of ceramic <b>metal</b> <b>joints,</b> for which two brittle failure modes (within the ceramic or at the interface) are observed during the experimental tests...|$|R

In the present study, detailed analysis of the surface layer on the taper interfaces is provided using advanced electron microscopies. Two retrieved taper interfaces were analysed. The taper interface varies along the length of the tapers.

40|$|System-in-Package (SiP) is a {{semiconductor}} {{packaging and}} integration approach to lower costs, increase performance and decrease form factor.
