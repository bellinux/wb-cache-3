40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the demand for and net economic benefits from Oregon salmon sport fishing. The <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method was used as the primary technique for demand analysis. Several empirical estimates of consumer surplus per trip and per fish were obtained from different estimation methods. The differences in net economic benefits among different versions of the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method were assessed. Empirical results indicated that the individual observation approaches produced higher consumer surplus estimates than the zone average approach when reported <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> were used. These higher estimates of net economic benefits are believed to be due in part to the bias caused by <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> measurement error. However, this problem of bias was dealt with by using the instrumental variable approach. Higher estimates of net economic benefits also resulted from the use of unadjusted individual observations (UIO) for fitting the recreational demand function because this approach does not account for the declining participation rates for the more distant zones. Therefore, it is recommended that the individual observations be adjusted to a per capita basis, or that the probability of participation be linked to the UIO estimates of demand in order to compute valid estimates of net economic benefits. A quality variable was incorporated into regional and hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models. Average and marginal values of the primary site and substitutes sites thus were directly derived from the demand equations. Estimates of total and average consumer surpluses computed from the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model were changed very little with the addition of the substitute and quality variables in the more completely specified regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models. This finding indicates that the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model may be basically robust for estimating total and average consumer surplus. However, additional research on other recreational activities is needed to see if estimates of total consumer surplus from the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model always remain relatively stable when quality and substitute variables are included in a regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> type of specification. Unfortunately, the numerical estimates of value per trip and per fish from the hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model were rather unstable and should be considered somewhat questionable for this study. Similarly, the estimates of marginal values per fish from the regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model did not seem very reasonable, being only about one-fourth of the average value per fish. Therefore, it appears that the more complex regional and hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models require more and better quality data to yield more accurate estimates of marginal values per fish...|$|R

A simple three-lane TOL corridor is developed and demand and value of time scenarios are systematically analysed using a user equilibrium assignment procedure. It is concluded that implementing a TOL when truck proportions are too low results in significantly higher <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> than if all lanes are left as general purpose lanes. Implementing a TOL when truck proportions are too high also does not result in <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> benefits.

40|$|Introduction: Natural {{resources}} and the environment, such as mountains are considered public goods. The main features of these public goods are lack of market and price for exchange. This issue leads to a worthless impression about these goods, lack of effort for their conservation and preventing resource degradation. One of the major benefits of environmental resources, such as mountains, is their function as environmental amenities (for leisure and recreation). The estimation of their recreational worth is important {{as a part of}} the total value of such resources. In this context, the aim of this study is to estimate the economic value of environmental amenities of Sofeh Highland Park in Isfahan by individual <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method. Materials and Methods: <b>Travel</b> <b>cost</b> method is used for the evaluation of public goods or environmental non-market commodities. It is applied to a wide range of areas, including tourism values of lakes and wetlands, coral reefs, biodiversity and national parks, recreational fishing and mountaineering. The <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> approach does not ask willingness to pay directly, but imputes it from the observed behavior of other visitors through an estimated demand function, which relates the number of observed trips to the incurred <b>travel</b> <b>cost.</b> Underpinning the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method is for the estimation of the recreational demand function, from which consumer surplus estimates can be derived. Consumer surplus -the measure of non-market benefits to the visitors- is the difference between what the visitor would be (theoretically) willing to pay to go the intended recreational location, and what they are actually required to pay. In this research, the individual <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method was used. For this purpose, a 290 item questionnaire with simple random sampling was filled by travelers in the area in 2013. Then the demand function of environmental amenities (tourism demand) was estimated in two scenarios by using negative binomial regression for the revealed and the expressed <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> and total <b>travel</b> <b>costs.</b> Results Discussion: Collected data shows that the average age of visitors is 31 years.

If properly analyzed, this data can {{be a source of}} rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist’s choice is directly affected by the <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> which includes the financial cost and the time. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we develop two cost-aware latent factor models to recommend travel packages by considering both the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> and the tourist’s interests.
