40|$|This study {{examines}} {{issues relating to}} the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by Greek listed companies. Initially, the impact of transition, {{as a result of}} differences between IFRS and Greek GAAP, on the first IFRS financial statements in 2005 is assessed. Then, a disclosure index is constructed, containing all the disclosure items mandated by the IFRS extant at the end of April 2006. Based on this research instrument, and two disclosure index methods, compliance with IFRS <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures</b> in their first year of implementation is examined. A review of disclosure theories, the features of the Greek financial reporting system, and considerations regarding the timing of the research are used as a basis for establishing a priori expectations and testing the potential factors explaining compliance with IFRS <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures.</b> Subsequently, any change in the value relevance of accounting information before and immediately after IFRS mandatory implementation is examined. Whether the reconciliation statements required by IFRS 1 provided value relevant information to investors is also explored. Finally, the valuation implications of IFRS <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures</b> are explored. The above analyses indicate the following. Greek listed companies’ financial statements were affected significantly by the adoption of IFRS. The average level of compliance with IFRS <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures</b> approximates to 80 %. The impact on net income and shareholders’ equity, {{as a result of the}} transition to IFRS, as well as audit firm size, are significantly associated with the extent to which companies comply. No change in the value relevance of accounting information between 2004 and 2005 is identified. Reconciliation adjustments are incrementally value relevant and levels of <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures</b> do have valuation effects. Based on the findings of the above analyses, the study contributes to the relevant literature and discusses policy implications. It also concludes with suggestions for further research and recommendations on the methods for measuring compliance with IFRS <b>mandatory</b> <b>disclosures.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In {{this thesis}} I study {{the effects of}} <b>mandatory</b> {{ownership}} <b>disclosures</b> on stock prices in the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki stock exchange. The objectives of the study are to find evidence of whether <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures</b> result in abnormal stock returns; what kind of returns these are; and whether abnormal returns are dependent on the information content of the disclosures, principally the resulting ownership level and the identity of the shareholder making the <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosure.</b> Finally, I also study the different factors that may be driving the abnormal returns relating to <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures.</b> DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The study sample consists of 1, 079 <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures,</b> 605 of which relate to increases of ownership and 474 to decreases of ownership. The time period of the study extends from January 1, 2000 to September 30, 2014. The study is based on the event study methodology and employs the market model for calculating estimated returns and actual abnormal returns. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: <b>Mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures</b> are associated with abnormal stock returns. The cumulative average abnormal returns for <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures</b> relating to increases of ownership are 0. 84 % in the 21 -day event window of [- 10, + 10]. Respectively, the cumulative average abnormal returns for <b>mandatory</b> ownership <b>disclosures</b> relating to ownership decreases are somewhat smaller and amount to - 0. 49 % in the 21 -day event window of [- 10, + 10]. However, the informational value of disclosures relating to ownership increases appears to be larger, since the cumulative abnormal returns in the 9 -day post-event window of [+ 2, + 10] amount to - 0. 72 % for ownership decreases and - 0. 30 % for ownership increases. Based on the results of this thesis, {{it is not possible to}} clearly and concisely determine the drivers of the abnormal returns. The cumulative abnormal returns are partially explained by the size of the company subject to the disclosure. Smaller companies are associated with larger abnormal returns. Furthermore, the identity of the shareholder has in some cases explanatory value. Shareholders that are typically considered as active non-portfolio investors are associated with larger cumulative abnormal returns. However, the most important factors explaining the abnormal returns are the stock's volatility and market volatility...|$|R
