40|$|In forestry, {{throughfall}} (Pi) is that {{fraction of}} rainfall that runs directly through the tree canopy and reaches the ground. It is characterized {{as the main}} source of water supply in a watershed. This study aimed to analyze the dynamics of throughfall in three types of forest stands, namely Eucalyptus cloeziana, Pinus sp. and seasonal semideciduous forest (FES), all located in Ipanema National Forest, in the municipality of Iperó-SP. In each stand, a 300 m² plot was established in which ten rain gauges were installed for <b>monitoring</b> <b>throughfall,</b> and three rain gauges were installed in an open area adjacent to the stand for measuring gross precipitation (P). At the end of 25 observations, it was observed that, relative to P values, Pi values were 76. 2 % in semideciduous forest (FES), 85. 1 % in E. cloeziana forest and 84. 0 % in Pinus sp forest. In addition, comparing these stands, a larger leaf canopy coverage and consequently greater capability for water retention was noted in the semideciduous forest. However, no statistical differences were observed (P< 0. 05) between the stands of interest regarding throughfall...|$|E
40|$|A 20 – 40 % {{reduction}} in soil moisture is projected for the boreal forest of Eastern Canada {{for the period}} 2070 – 99 relative to 1971 – 2000. In order to better predict {{the effects of a}} reduced water supply on the growth of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), a dominant tree species of the boreal forest, we simulated 2 consecutive years of summer droughts (starting in July) by means of throughfall exclusion. Four 100 -m 2 plots were established in 2010 with polyethylene sheets maintained 1. 3 – 2 m aboveground and redirecting the water outside the plots. Wood microcores were extracted weekly from mature trees from April to October 2011 to analyse the time dynamics of wood formation in that year. The number of tracheids formed during and before treatment and their anatomical characteristics were determined through microscopic analyses. The growth of lateral and terminal branches and the water potential of balsam fir seedlings were also <b>monitored.</b> <b>Throughfall</b> exclusion significantly reduced soil water content by 5. 8 % in 2010 and 10. 5 % in 2011. Xylogenesis was affected significantly by the treatment. Tracheids were 16. 1 % smaller in diameter and their cell wall was 14. 1 % thicker during both years. The treatment delayed by more than a week the start of the tracheid differentiation process in the second year with a concomitant decrease (26 %) in the number of tracheids produced.

40|$|Since June 2004 {{throughfall}} {{samples in}} beech and spruce vegetation {{have been taken}} at the observatory Milesovka. Ever since 1998 fog water samples have been taken there as well. In this paper are compared the concentrations of main ions and trace elements in throughfall and in deposited precipitation. The concentrations of main ions and trace elements in throughfal are primarily affected by the volume of samples. The highest concentrations of <b>monitored</b> sustances in <b>throughfall</b> were recorded in September and in October when the lowest rainfall totals were measured. The concentrations of monitored sustances were in throughfall mostly higher in spruce vegetation in comparison with beech vegetation. It is {{probably due to the}} thicker treetop in spruce vegetation on Milesovka observatory. Due to the thicker treetop a smaller volume of throughfall is let fall and the substances from ambient air are captured more effectively in comparison with beech vegetation. In the case of main ions the lowest concentrations were measured in fog water samples. For trace elements wasn´t data. From comparison with reference locality Lesni potok is obvious that concentrations of <b>monitored</b> sustances in <b>throughfall</b> on Milesovka exceed sharply concentrations in locality Lesni potok. This difference is considerably higher by spruce vegetation in comparison to beech vegetation which indicate that it is necessary take not only local air quality into account but also type of vegetation and thick of treetop which can very significantly contribute to the chemical composition of throughfall...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} shrub {{clearing}} on surface and subsurface water {{movement in the}} Edwards Aquifer region were investigated using two large‐scale rainfall simulation plots. Multiple replications of a large (168 mm) rainfall event were applied at an ashe juniper covered plot before and after shrub removal and at a plot with longstanding herbaceous cover. The study sites were equipped for <b>monitoring</b> of <b>throughfall,</b> stemflow, surface runoff, and soil water. Lateral subsurface flow was measured in a trench at the downhill end of each plot. The canopy plot produced high lateral subsurface flow during rainfall but no surface runoff, even for high rainfall intensities. In contrast, hydrologic response at the inter‐canopy plot was dominated by rapid surface runoff. Following shrub removal at the canopy plot, water movement beyond the soil layer increased due to reduced canopy interception. Soil water storage capacity at the shrub plot remained small for both conditions, with much water apparently bypassing the litter and soil layers via macropore pathways. This additional water could move off site as macropore flow or remain on site as matrix and conduit storage. Differences in surface runoff and subsurfaceflow are attributable to vegetation and geologic differences...|$|R
40|$|Changes in sulphur and {{nitrogen}} pollution in Swedish forests have been assessed {{in relation to}} European emission reductions, based on measurements in the Swedish <b>Throughfall</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Network. Measurements were analysed over 20 years {{with a focus on}} the 12 -year period 1996 to 2008. Air concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2, have decreased. The SO 4 -deposition has decreased in parallel with the European emission reductions. Soil water SO 4 -concentrations have decreased at most sites but the pH, ANC and inorganic Al-concentrations indicated acidification recovery only at some of the sites. No changes in the bulk deposition of inorganic nitrogen could be demonstrated. Elevated NO 3 -concentrations in the soil water occurred at irregular occasions at some southern sites. Despite considerable air pollution emission reductions in Europe, acidification recovery in Swedish forests soils is slow. Nitrogen deposition to Swedish forests continues at elevated levels that may lead to leaching of nitrate to surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In January 2005, {{south-west}} Sweden {{was hit by}} {{a severe}} storm that caused large damage to the forests through massive windthrow. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of this windthrow on nitrate concentrations in the soil water below the root zone on 33 forest monitoring plots within the Swedish <b>Throughfall</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Network (SWETHRO). These sites were damaged to different extents by the storm. The analysis showed increased levels of nitrate concentrations in the soil water as a consequence of storm damaged forest. The present study concerned forest ecosystems with relatively low levels of nitrogen deposition, as compared with forests analysed in previous studies. The maximum soil water nitrate concentrations occurred 1 - 4 years after the storm. After 5 - 6 years, the concentrations were back at the same levels as before the storm event. It was not possible to demonstrate a significant correlation between increased nitrate concentrations in the soil water after the storm and the level of nitrogen deposition at the site. The potential impact on ground- and surface waters due to elevated nitrate concentrations in soil water after storm events is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Wind was shown to enhance fog interception, but this alone could not explain the difference in fog catch between the two sites. Higher liquid water content and more frequent fog occurrence contributed to the difference as well.

Annual streamwater sulfate export is on the order of 770 Eq·ha– 1 yr– 1 or about one-third of total annual inputs, indicating there is net watershed sulfate retention.

40|$|Large scale forest {{regrowth}} is {{one aspect}} of modern land-cover change. Yet, despite the importance of understanding the hydrological consequences of land cover dynamics, the relation between forest succession and canopy interception is poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is unfortunate because rainfall interception {{plays an important role}} in regional water cycles and needs to be quantified for many modelling purposes. To help close this knowledge gap, we designed a <b>throughfall</b> <b>monitoring</b> study along a secondary succession gradient in a tropical forest region of Panama. The investigated gradient comprises 20 natural forest patches regrowing for 3 up to about 130 yr. We sampled each patch with a minimum of 20 funnel-type throughfall collectors over a continuous two-month period that had nearly 900 mm of rain. At the same time and locations, we acquired forest inventory data and derived several forest structural attributes. We then applied simple and multiple regression models (Bayesian Model Averaging, BMA) and identified those vegetation parameters that have the strongest influence on the variation of canopy interception. Our analyses provide three main findings. First, canopy interception changes rapidly during forest succession. After only a decade, throughfall volumes approach levels that are typical for mature forests. Second, a parsimonious (simple linear regression) model based on the ratio of the basal area of small stems to the total basal area outperformed more complex multivariate models (BMA approach). Third, based on complementary forest inventory data we show that the influence of young secondary forests on interception in real-world fragmented landscapes might be detectable only in regions with a substantial fraction of very young forests. In case entire catchments are subject to forest regrowth, initial stages may be associated with undesirable effects on streamflow generation. Our results further highlight the need to study all forest succession stages, including early ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{capture of}} cloud and fog {{droplets}} by vegetation as a possibly important deposition mechanism has been recognised lately after reports of increased forest decline with altitude. We {{are concerned with}} interception, impaction and stickiness of polluted cloud water and fog droplets to terrestrial surfaces, including forest canopies. This deposition is mediated by low-level clouds, in which parts of the terrain can be immersed, or {{by the presence of}} orographic and radiation fog. In this study the transport of cloud and fog droplets towards terrestrial surfaces is parameterised and the “occult” deposition (mediated by both clouds and fog) is calculated by a new approach, implemented in “Sverigemodellen” (MATCH-Sverige), a 3 D Eulerian transport and dispersion model employed for making environmental assessments in Sweden. The model scheme is taking into account the mesoscale analysis (MESAN) of low-cloud coverage and cloud-base height, the visibility analysis, detailed topography information, land use, modelled atmospheric concentrations and the instantaneous deposition parameters for the investigated species (acidifying air pollutants: sulphate and oxidised/reduced nitrogen). The model scheme is validated by comparing with <b>throughfall</b> <b>monitoring</b> of sulphate deposition to coniferous forests at elevated sites in the Swedish mountains. It shows a rather good fit to the measurements, generally within 25 %, which is deemed as encouraging. Discrepancies exist though and are subject of discussion. The percentage of occult deposition can be up to 115 % of the sum of dry and wet deposition. Therefore we cannot ignore this contribution in the assessments of deposition of acidifying pollutants. The highest fluxes of cloud deposition are assigned to mountainous regions in Northern Sweden, while the highest fog deposition is calculated at a location in Jönköpings County, on the Sydsvenska höglandet...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of throughfall {{is a result}} of numerous processes that affect the concentrations of its individual components in the original wet precipitation above the tree crowns. The precipitation entering the tree crowns is generally enriched throughout its interactions with the above - ground part of the vegetation. The samples of open place precipitation and throughfall have been collected since 1989 in the region of Kostelec n. Č. lesy. The monitored area is situated predominantly in the Nature State Reserve Voděradské bučiny on the bedrock of the Říčany and Jevany granites. The exact evaluation of the impact of metabolites on the resultant concentration and fluxes of individual <b>monitored</b> elements in <b>throughfall,</b> based on mere comparison with the corresponding values in open place precipitation, is faced with several problems. First, the {{chemistry of}} throughfall reflects more the chemical composition of aerosol from lower parts of the atmosphere, as it is more or less effectively swept out by the above ground growth. The vegetation surface also entraps the reactive atmospheric gasses. Finally, the original precipitation solution is thickened through the evapotranspiration and it is enriched by the excluded and leached metabolites. The estimate of the extent of metabolic activity of the forest trees on the chemistry of throughfall was therefore limited on the comparison of a relative magnitude of normalised fluxes of individual elements in a given type of throughfall. The fluxes of individual elements in a beech- and spruce throughfall were normalised on the Na fluxes, with respect to the supposed zero metabolic share of Na in throughfall and to its predominantly natural sources in the atmospheric aerosol. The calculation of the enrichment factor Ef of the individual elements was then executed by means of the relation EfTFB,TFS (Me) = FBP Na / FTFB,TFS Na* FTFB,TFS Me / FBP Me, where EfTFB,TFS (Me) is the enrichment factor od the particular element in a given type of throughfall, FBP Na a FBP Me are the mean annual deposition fluxes of Na and the element Me on an open place, and FTFB,TFS Na a FTFB,TFS Me are the mean annual fluxes of Na and the element Me in throughfall. Values of the enrichment factor for the individual elements are presented in the article in the Tab. 1. Values higher than 1 should generally indicate the presence of metabolic products of the vegetation. The highest Ef values were found, after expectations, for the basic nutrients and significant essential elements, in a row of K > Mg > Mn > Ca. Together with these elements, significant impact of leached metabolites was also found for Rb, Sr and Ba. The enrichment of throughfall with rubidium is extraordinary high, probably even higher than that of its homologue potassium. Surprisngly high values of the Rb deposition fluxes in both tyes of throughfall certify the extensive input of this element through the root uptake of the forest vegetation, which is contingent on very close chemical characteristics of rubidium and potassium (ionic radii, electronegativity, ionic character of bonding of these alkaline metals in all their chemical compounds etc.). We have not found, however, similar pronounced paralell between Ca, Sr and especially Ba, which is even more abundant in the underlying rocks and soils than Sr...|$|R
