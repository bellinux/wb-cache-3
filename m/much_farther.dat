5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} poetry goes <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> {{back in time and}} is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E

Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|The Australasian Antarctic Expedition, {{commanded}} by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914.

60|$|The cruise {{continued}} {{a fortnight}} in this desultory manner, {{with the same}} want of success. One morning, as Fuller was returning to the boat, after passing {{the night in a}} farm-house, he was struck by the statue-like appearance of a figure which stood on the extreme point of a low, rocky promontory, that was considerably aside from any dwelling or building. The place was just at the commencement of the hill country, and where the shores of the Seneca cease to offer those smiling pictures of successful husbandry that so <b>much</b> abound <b>farther</b> north. A somber, or it might be better to say a sober, aspect gave dignity to the landscape, which, if not actually grand, had, at least, most of the elements that characterize the noble in nature.|$|R
5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E

Ice age fossils of the jaguar, dated between 40,000 and 11,500 years ago, have been discovered in the United States, including some at an important site {{as far north as}} Missouri. Fossil evidence shows jaguars of up to 190kg (420lb), much larger than the contemporary average for the animal.|$|E
5|$|The hotel faced stiff {{competition}} from the early 20th century, {{with a range of}} new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-afternoon {{hours of}} January22, a new {{low-pressure}} area {{began to develop}} over {{the coast of the}} Carolinas as the former storm tracked into central Georgia. Owing to uncertainty in short-range guidance but a high confidence of a sharp northern edge of precipitation, many forecasts until just hours before snowfall began were predicting 12" [...] of snow or less from Allentown, Pennsylvania, toward New York City and the southern coast of New England. As the storm moved further north and rapidly strengthened, it became apparent that snowfall would be <b>much</b> higher <b>farther</b> north and forecasters quickly began upgrading their totals. Early on January 24, as the storm was leaving New England, the system began to become elongated, as a secondary low developed to the southwest of the storm's central low. On January 25, the blizzard left the East Coast of the United States; on the same day, the system was named Karin by the University of Berlin.|$|R
60|$|Next for the {{impression}} they make on the Retina, {{we will further}} examine this Hypothesis: Suppose therefore ABCDEF, in the fifth Figure, to represent the Ball of the eye: on the Cornea of which ABC two Rays GACH and KCAI (which are the terminating Rays of a luminous body) falling, are by the refraction thereof collected or converg'd into two points {{at the bottom of}} the eye. Now, because these terminating Rays, and all the intermediate ones which come from any part of the luminous body, are suppos'd by some sufficient refraction before they enter the eye, to have their pulses made oblique to their progression, and consequently each Ray to have potentially superinduc'd two proprieties, or colours, viz., a Red on the one side, and a Blue on the other, which notwithstanding are never actually manifest, but when this or that Ray has the one or the other side of it bordering on a dark or unmov'd medium, therefore as soon as these Rays are entred into the eye and so have one side of each of them bordering on a dark part of the humours of the eye, they will each of them actually exhibit some colour; therefore ADC the production of GACH will exhibit a Blue, because the side CD is adjacent to the dark medium CQDC, but nothing of a Red, because its side AD is adjacent to the enlightned medium ADFA: And all the Rays that from the points of the luminous body are collected on the parts of the Retina between D and F shall have their Blue so much the more diluted by how <b>much</b> the <b>farther</b> these points of collection are distant from D towards F; and the Ray AFC the production of KCAI, will exhibit a Red, because the side AF is adjacent to the dark or quiet medium of the eye APFA, but nothing of a Blue, because its side CF is adjacent to the enlightned medium CFDC, and all the Rays from the intermediate parts of the luminous body that are collected between F and D shall have their Red so much the more diluted, by how <b>much</b> the <b>farther</b> they are distant from F towards D.|$|R
25|$|The {{nephew of}} one of the men {{responsible}} for popularity of the penny-farthing was largely responsible for its demise. James Starley had built the Ariel (spirit of the air) high-wheeler in 1870; but this was a time of innovation, and when chain drives were upgraded so that each link had a small roller, higher and higher speeds became possible without the large wheel. In 1885, Starley's nephew John Kemp Starley took these new developments to launch the Rover Safety Bicycle, so-called because the rider, seated <b>much</b> lower and <b>farther</b> behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.|$|R
5|$|The nearest star to the Earth, {{apart from}} the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 {{trillion}} kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be much closer {{to each other in}} the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> apart in galactic halos.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits are <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> from Saturn, {{have high}} inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or {{debris from the}} breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn, discovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E

New Act,--or, we may call it New PART; Drama of World-History, Part Third. If Part SECOND was 1,800 years ago, this I reckon will be Part THIRD. This is the truly celestial-infernal Event: the strangest we have seen for a thousand years. Celestial in one part; in the other, infernal.

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk.

The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097.

5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are <b>much</b> <b>farther</b> from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E
