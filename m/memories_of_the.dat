When a sharp interface between the liquid and the solid phases is assumed, <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latent heat is "lumped" in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interface.

Considering that Belgrade was bombed by two {{opposing}} forces during WWII, once by Nazis in 1941, {{and the second}} time by the Allies in 1944, and {{due to the fact}} that <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two bombings was rather unequal during the Socialist Yugoslavia with the latter bombings being a taboo theme, I was interested in answering following questions: how the two memories were used in the times before, during and after the NATO Air Strikes <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, if <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied bombings emerged in the public sphere and how it coexists with <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi bombings.

5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{histories}} of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners. As living <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had come through the Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E
