2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982, which introduced a [...] Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the territories of all nations with an ocean coastline, several Southwest Pacific island nations found themselves responsible for policing an area of ocean that was beyond their <b>maritime</b> <b>capability,</b> and often significantly larger than their land territories (at its most extreme, the EEZ of Tuvalu [...] dwarfs its landmass by a ratio of almost 1:28,000). Following requests by several Pacific nations for assistance from the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the Australian government created a Defence Cooperation Project, the Pacific Patrol Boat Program to design and provide suitable patrol boats to nearby island nations, along with training and infrastructure to support these ships.

40|$|This report assesses Australia’s Defence White Paper 2013 from India’s {{point of}} view. Summary The {{recently}} released Australian Defence White Paper, which came a year ahead of schedule, has drawn more attention from India. Until {{a few years}} ago, India was reluctant to understand the strategic significance of the largest country in the Southern Hemisphere, which is to {{play a key role}} in the region encompassed by the geo-strategic term “Indo-Pacific”. Key Points 	The Australian Defence White Paper 2013 assumes a new importance from India’s point of view with the increasing significance of the geo-political term, “Indo-Pacific”. 	India’s shift of strategic priority from South-East Asia to the South-West Pacific – as per the “Look East” policy – is welcomed in the White Paper. 	India recognises that it will need to re-organise its Command and Staff systems with a view to Joint Operations in the Indo-Pacific in the years ahead, with countries such as Australia. 	Both India and Australia are wary of China’s increased <b>maritime</b> <b>capabilities</b> in the Indo-Pacific; both countries will co-operate with Washington to counter that. 	Increased Chinese pressure in India’s Northern Borders region, means that New Delhi will shelve allocating more resources to enhance its <b>maritime</b> <b>capabilities</b> and will focus on increasing its land and air capabilities. Conclusion Both India and Australia intend to expand their <b>maritime</b> <b>capabilities</b> in the Indo-Pacific region, as a way of countering Beijing’s increased military capabilities in the region. India’s role will be welcomed by countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The outer strategic arc to contain Beijing’s <b>maritime</b> <b>capabilities</b> will be provided by the United States, with inner security arrangements provided by countries in the Indo-Pacific region. There is one possible variant to this arrangement. If India feels more threatened by the Chinese military presence on its Northern Borders, such as the recent border incident at Leh in Ladakh, it will not hesitate to give more attention to increasing its Army and Land capabilities. This could include envisaging the formation of three mountain strike forces, meaning that India would have to shelve its plans for naval expansion, which may be of concern to countries that are involved in maritime strategic co-operation with India, such as Australia. This scenario was not discussed in the Australian Defence White Paper...|$|R
