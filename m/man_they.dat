6000|$|The case is very simple, if {{you will}} look at Isaiah's own words. These Jews had become {{thoroughly}} bad <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> were not ungodly <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> were very religious, orthodox, devout <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> 'sought God daily, and delighted to know his ways, like a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinances of their God: they asked of him the ordinances of justice; they took delight in approaching unto God.' ...|$|R

5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, {{to a maximum of}} $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a <b>man</b> <b>they</b> falsely claimed was the hijacker.|$|E

5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a <b>man</b> <b>they</b> had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; on another occasion, he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as the <b>man</b> <b>they</b> most needed to apprehend, but apart from the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every <b>man</b> <b>they</b> found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the <b>man</b> <b>they</b> have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a <b>man</b> <b>they</b> know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best <b>man.</b> <b>They</b> have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How to Survive, a spyglass, and a fishing rod. Charlton {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising {{that they are}} there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller {{is part of a}} gang of forgers. He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the <b>man</b> <b>they</b> told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} D-Day, Miller {{receives}} orders to find Ryan {{and bring him}} back from the front. He assembles six men from his company—T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Privates First Class Richard Reiben and Adrian Caparzo, Privates Stanley Mellish and Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade—plus T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer and interpreter borrowed from another unit. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper. They locate a Private James Ryan, but quickly learn he is not their <b>man.</b> <b>They</b> eventually encounter a friend of James Ryan, who tells them that he is defending an important bridge {{in the town of}} Ramelle.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military <b>man,</b> <b>they</b> felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
