40|$|The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey is {{providing}} new rotation measures (RMs) for compact extragalactic {{sources in the}} Galactic plane at a solid-angle density of roughly 1 source per square degree. To date, we have derived reliable RM values for 380 sources along lines of sight through the disk of the Galaxy {{in the first and}} second quadrants. The purpose is to provide a data set useful for studies of the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>component</b> of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We present the method used to obtain the measurements and the resulting RMs...|$|E
30|$|The {{specialty}} of the Saura radar {{is the large}} antenna array, which is comprised of 29 crossed antennas arranged in a Mills Cross configuration and annexed by two additional antennas. The latter are typically only used for reception in a spaced antenna configuration for the interferometric analysis of the detected signals. The comparably large antenna array, for a radar system operating in the medium frequency range, spreads well over 1  ×  1  km and thus offers a good angular resolution with a minimum half-power beam width of 6.3 ^∘ and 6.6 ^∘, respectively pointing boresight and 6.8 ^∘ off-vertical. Another example for such a large antenna array used for atmospheric science at such low frequencies is the Buckland Park MF radar and was described by Holdsworth and Reid (2004). The arrangement of the Saura antenna array is shown in Fig.  1, where antennas marked in red depict the receiving configuration used in this study. Each dipole of the crossed antennas in the array is connected to an individual transceiver module being adjustable in phase and providing 2  kW peak power each. This configuration provides radar beam steering capabilities {{as well as the}} generation of right and left circular polarization, respectively matching the ordinary and extraordinary <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>component,</b> often abbreviated by O/X. The atmosphere is typically probed sequentially in vertical and four oblique directions (see Table  1 for details). With such characteristics, the versatile Saura radar is mainly used to derive the wind field in the mesosphere by applying Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS, see Woodman and Guillen 1974) or Spaced Antenna techniques (SA) applying the full correlation analysis method (FCA, see Briggs 1984; Vincent et al. 1987). The temporal resolution of Saura radar winds depends on the chosen radar experiment settings at the given time. The individual experiments nowadays have a run time of roughly 4  min, 215  s for the vertical and 235  s for the multi-beam experiment including oblique soundings. The typical experiment sequence is scheduled as follows, one vertical followed by two multi-beam experiments, with a sequence length of 12  min. For this study, only single pulse experiments with 1  km pulse width are used to prevent potential code side lobe contamination at mesospheric heights generated by long range-coded high duty cycle signals on transmission scattered off the E region.|$|E
30|$|Besides {{measuring}} winds in the D region, the Saura radar is {{also used}} to estimate electron number densities by the interleaved sounding with both <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>components</b> and applying Differential Absorption (DAE) and Differential Phase (DPE) measurements [see, e.g., Singer et al. 2011)].|$|R
40|$|Low-frequency ionospheric polarization, {{relative}} virtual height, {{and relative}} reflection coefficient measurements {{were made at}} near vertical incidence during October 1952. These measurements were made at a frequency of 50 kc/s. A new, continuous-wave, phase-measuring technique was employed. The essential features of the system are (1) a horizontal transmitting antenna near {{the surface of the}} ground which is resonant at the operating frequency and which radiates no ground wave {{in the direction of the}} receiver and (2) a receiving station located within line-of-sight of the transmitter at which the phase of the low-frequency sky wave is directly compared with a reference phase transmitted over a very-high-frequency link. The transmitting antenna is considered in detail, and the electronics system is briefly described. Some of the general features of the earth's atmosphere and the ionosphere are presented. The magneto-ionic theory is developed, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an ionized atmosphere is discussed. This material is presented in order that the 50 -kc/s ionospheric data may be properly interpreted. The applicability of the quasi-homogeneous, magneto-ionic theory to low-frequency-propagation problems is considered. The virtual height of the E-layer was found to change by approximately 7. 5 km during the sunrise and sunset periods. Rapid fluctuations in the virtual height and reflection coefficients of the E-layer are attributed to (1) strong magneto-ionic splitting, (2) fluctuating ionization gradients in the lower nighttime E-region, (3) interference effects due to the presence of two or more partially reflecting layers (i. e. the fine structure of the E-layer), and (4) interference effects due to the interaction of the two <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>components.</b> Not all of the polarization results are consistent with the predictions of the quasi-homogeneous, magneto-ionic theory. Low-frequency noise measurements were also made during October 1952. The 50 -kc/s atmospheric noise field strength reached a maximum value during the middle of the night. The atmospheric noise received in the east-west direction reached a much higher maximum value than that received in the north-south direction...|$|R
