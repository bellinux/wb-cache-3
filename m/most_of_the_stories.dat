5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes {{in the margins of}} ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, {{but many of the}} stories feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate. Initially <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.|$|E

25|$|The book {{consisted}} of 15 stories, {{the most of}} any Saint collection. Some editions list the separate stories as chapters. The stories are each approximately 10 pages in length. (Some editions appear to present these stories in different order). Although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> are stand-alones, a few are connected to each other through plot or characters.|$|E
25|$|This series ran for 321 {{issues and}} {{established}} {{almost all the}} conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources, but many were original stories.|$|E
25|$|Optic Nerve is Tomine's ongoing comic {{title that}} was {{originally}} self-published in minicomic form and distributed to local comics shops in his area.

25|$|Ranma ½ has a comedic {{formula and}} a sex-changing main character, who often willfully {{transforms}} into {{a girl to}} advance his goals. The series also contains many other characters, whose intricate relationships with each other, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series.|$|E
25|$|These {{stories were}} written from 1887 to 1897 for the {{magazine}} Der Gute Kamerad. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as {{he is in the}} travel stories. The best known volume is Der Schatz im Silbersee. In the broadest sense the early works Im fernen Westen and Der Waldläufer belong to these category.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} musical contributor {{during the first}} 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for Blake's 7, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of The Tomorrow People. Simpson's first Doctor Who score was Planet of Giants (1964) {{and he went on}} to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with The Horns of Nimon (1979).

25|$|The stories {{frequently}} {{deal with}} illicit liaisons, {{the problems that}} flow from them {{and the way to}} escape those crises by using one's wits. Though the actual purpose of the parrot is to prevent its mistress from leaving, it does so without moralising. At the end of the seventy days, the woman's husband returns from his trip abroad and all is forgiven. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> are ribald and uninhibited, with some verging on the pornographic. The situations depicted in the stories not only test the bounds of marriage, some stray into taboo areas of incest and, in one case, zoophilia.|$|E
25|$|Although Irina was {{understanding}} about Yusupov's wild past, {{her parents were}} not. When her parents and maternal grandmother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna heard the rumours about Felix, they wanted to call off the wedding. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> that they heard had originated from Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Irina's first cousin once removed, who {{had been one of}} Felix's friends and, it has been speculated, might have been involved in a romantic relationship with Felix. Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> in dime novels stood alone, but in {{the late}} 1880s series {{characters}} began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original Frank Reade stories first appeared in Boys of New York. The Old Sleuth, appearing in The Fireside Companion story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character {{to use the word}} sleuth to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of {{the use of the word}} old in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. Nick Carter first appeared in 1886 in the New York Weekly. Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.|$|E

25|$|Produced by Anime International Company and {{directed}} by Hisashi Saito, the anime was broadcast on TV Saitama and Chiba TV from October 4 to December 27, 2009, with subsequent broadcasts on KBS Kyoto, TV Kanagawa, Sun Television, TVQ, Tokyo MX and TV Aichi. English-subtitled simulcasts were provided by Crunchyroll on their video portal. Seven DVD compilation volumes were released between December 25, 2009 and June 25, 2010 by Kadokawa Pictures, with limited edition volumes also sold. A Blu-ray box set was released on June 24, 2011. The anime is licensed in North America by Funimation as Heaven's Lost Property: Sora no Otoshimono, and released the first season on December 20, 2011. Heaven's Lost Property covers events up to the Nymph/Harpies storyline of the manga, with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> resequenced to fit the themes of the episodes, for instance, the visit to Mikako Satsukitane's place is coupled with the island vacation trip. Both Mikako and Nymph are introduced earlier in the series so they participate in more of the events.|$|E
25|$|Rosa's idol when {{it comes}} to comics is Carl Barks. Rosa builds almost all his stories on {{characters}} and locations that Barks invented. Many of Rosa's stories contain references to some fact pointed out in a Barks story. At the request of publishers in response to reader demands, Rosa has even created sequels of old Barks stories. For example, his Return to Xanadu is a sequel to Tralla La, where the Ducks return to the same hidden country. To add more to his admiration and consistency to Barks and Barks' stories, Rosa makes all his ducks' stories set in the 1950s. This is because Barks writes <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> about Scrooge, Donald and all people of Duckburg in the 1950s (it also conveniently resolves potential continuity problems, such as Scrooge's age). As explained in text pages in the Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck and its companion volume, Rosa does intense research of time periods to ensure not only that he gets the physical details right, but also to ensure that all characters could have been present.|$|E
25|$|From Series 3, The Goon Show (as it was {{now officially}} titled) {{gradually}} settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by {{the second half of}} Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot, with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of Wally Stott, who had been writing for the show since the first series. After the end of Series 3, original announcer Andrew Timothy was replaced (at the suggestion of John Snagge) by Wallace Greenslade, who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.|$|E

25|$|Krishna, {{the setting}} for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> is a world similar to Earth, though its {{humanoid}} natives {{tend to be more}} impulsive and volatile. Their planet is drier than Earth, having no ocean or continents as such, but rather a worldwide landmass dotted with numerous seas and lakes. As a result, much of its area is composed of broad desert and steppe regions inhabited by nomads who periodically overwhelm and destroy the civilizations of the better-watered and more settled regions. Thus Krishnan civilization, while older than that of Earth by tens of thousands of years, has never progressed to a technological stage, having been forced to continually rebuild itself in the wake of repeated disasters. In the region of the Triple Seas, the planet's largest drainage area and the setting of {{all but one of the}} Krishna stories, the most recent disaster occurred over a thousand years prior to the contact era, when the Kalwmian Empire was destroyed and partially overrun by the Varastou people. At the time of the stories the Varastou nations themselves are similarly threatened by the nomads of Qaath. The presence of the Terrans with their superior technology complicates the situation, Despite the much-resented technological blockade, the local nations are beginning to develop their own technology after the Terran example, even as Terran culture undermines its customs and institutions. For instance, a railway network is slowly spreading around the Triple Seas, though the trains are pulled by elephantine local beasts rather than powered engines. The premier example of Krishnan adaptation is the island nation of Sotaspé, whose prince has established a patent system to encourage innovation.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Harriet Adams {{created the}} Tom Swift, Jr. series, which was {{published}} using the pseudonym [...] "Victor Appleton II" [...] as author.
