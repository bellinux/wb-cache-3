30|$|Consideration of {{the four}} {{education}} groups shows some heterogeneity between groups. While the overall trends in the development can be seen – more or less – for all groups, the gaps between wages of experienced and young workers are clearly larger for the two high-skilled groups. On the other hand, the widening of the within-education-group wage gap is less emphasized for those groups over the 36  years of analysis. Since {{the turn of the}} century, however, the stronger decrease of <b>median</b> <b>wages</b> of the young compared to the experienced has nevertheless imposed more inequality. 3 The trends of <b>median</b> <b>wages</b> of the medium-skilled, who are the largest group (see above), are similar to the overall picture. Vice versa, the divergence between experienced and younger workers’ wages is stronger than in the two high-skilled groups. Finally, for the low-skilled, wages have risen more or less steadily from 1975 to around 1990, and have started to decrease slightly and monotonously thereafter.

The model where JS depends on monetary (relative wages), social (relative number of friends), content and career components is compared with models where JS has only the first or the first two of these. It creates a more realistic firm size distribution and smaller duration of unemployment and on-the-job search. Average JS increases but <b>median</b> <b>wages</b> decrease with firm size for both manual and non-manual jobs.
