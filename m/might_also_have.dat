50|$|Giorgi III Dadiani {{was married}} three times. His first wife was Rodam, a {{daughter}} of Rostom Gurieli, Prince of Guria, whom he divorced in 1564 and took the wife of his own uncle Batulia, a Circassian princess. His third wife was Tamar, from the Abkhazian princely dynasty of Shervashidze, a sister-in-law of George II of Imereti. Giorgi had the only son Levan (1577-1582). He <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a daughter, Ana, who was married to Giorgi Lipartiani, lord of Salipartiano.|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, may {{represent}} the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been the ancestor of deer.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional {{creatures of the}} 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Conisbrough Castle was {{probably}} similar to two other castles {{owned by the}} Warren earls. Hamelin Plantagenet was also responsible {{for the development of}} Mortemer Castle in France, where a similar keep was built on top of a motte, and Conisbrough <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> had resemblances to Sandal Castle in the north of England, also owned by the earls. The design of the keep was poor from a military perspective. The central circular tower provided defensive advantages but the buttresses introduced 12 vulnerable corners into the stonework, and the keep itself had no arrow slots to permit the defenders to fire on any attackers. Rather than being designed primarily for military defence, it was constructed to symbolise and reinforce Hamelin's lordship and new social status.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{intensive}} research, {{little is}} known about the origin of the angiosperms and their rise to ecological dominance during the Early Cretaceous. Based on whole-genome analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana, there is compelling evidence that angiosperms underwent two whole-genome duplication events early during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that these events were crucial for the creation of many important developmental and regulatory genes found in extant angiosperm genomes. Here, we argue that these ancient polyploidy events <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> an important role in the origin and diversification of the angiosperms...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the removal assays are in {{agreement}} with those found for the colonization assays, since a significant decrease of biomass of both bacterial strains was only found on the SH surface (Figure 1), suggesting, once again, that the distinct characteristics of both surfaces tested must be responsible for such outcomes. Thus, {{it is possible to}} infer that the crevices of the SH surface not only offer an increased area for attachment by providing more contact points, but also afford protection against shear forces (Verran and Boyd 2001; Whitehead and Verran 2006). Moreover, the extracellular matrix formed by P. aeruginosa cells on the SH material <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a protective effect during the removal assays, due to its crucial role in maintaining structural integrity of P. aeruginosa biofilms (Chen and Stewart 2002).|$|R
5|$|Studies {{made with}} the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have {{discovered}} that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for {{the origin of the}} carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.|$|E
5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636–37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may have helped create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> helped to burst the bubble.|$|E
5|$|While {{the revolt}} was {{unfolding}} in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable {{influence over the}} development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> proved unreliable {{in the face of a}} popular uprising.|$|E

5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is {{parental care}} for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been common to all dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. Parental care being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{the couple}} moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon {{took a job}} at the Office of Price Administration. In his {{political}} campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier. He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy. As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.|$|E

The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on the staple guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with the staple guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed at}} {{establishing}} a protocol {{to increase the}} number of regenerated shoots and to limit the recovery of "escapes" during the regeneration of transgenic flax plants (cv Barbara).

On comparison of the transformation rate observed while using low light (LL) and high light (HL) a considerable enhancement from 0. 12 to 5. 7 % was evident. The promotive effect of light <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a direct beneficial effect on transgenic plant production time leading to a reduction of more than 4 months in the time need to obtain transgenic seeds.

5|$|Representation at the League {{was often}} a problem. Though it was {{intended}} to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the executive branch without having the prior approval of the legislative branch.|$|E
5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall.
