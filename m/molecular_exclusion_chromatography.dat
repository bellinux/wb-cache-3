40|$|A dipeptidyl {{aminopeptidase}} (DPP) {{was detected}} in plasma membranes from normal (3 T 3) and transformed (3 T 12) mouse fibroblasts. This enzyme {{was active in}} cleaving the prolyl bond in the synthetic dipeptide nitroanilide Gly-Pro-NH-Np, which is a specific substrate for DPP IV (Km 0. 63 mM and Vmax 6. 1 nmol/min per mg at pH 6. 0 and 37 degrees C). However, it did not degrade Pro-NH-Np or other dipeptide nitroanilides such as Gly-Arg-NH-Np or Val-Ala-NH-Np. The enzyme was totally inhibited by di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate (Pri 2 -P-F) and by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, indicating a serine catalytic site for the proteinase. DPP IV is a glycoprotein that specifically recognized immobilized gelatin and type I collagen. Upon <b>molecular</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> the proteinase exhibited an apparent Mr of 100, 000. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed that the [3 H]Pri 2 -P-protein was exclusively represented by a polypeptide of Mr 55, 000. This suggested that DPP IV consists of two non-covalently linked 55, 000 -Mr subunits. Fibroblast adhesion to native or denatured collagen was significantly inhibited by the two dipeptide inhibitors of DPP IV, Gly-Pro-Ala and Ala-Pro-Gly, but not by the peptides Gly-Pro and Gly-Gly-Gly, which are not inhibitors of the proteinase.

High resolution techniques for instance the fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) are also used to obtain lectins with high purity. A large number of lectins characterized by specific techniques are available with different carbohydrate specificities. Lectins or lectin molecular forms have structural characteristics making them unique proteins. The pure molecules can contribute to unravel its structure, potential biological function, as well as biotechnological and biomedical uses. Lectins can have applications in different areas of knowledge; they can be used to explore cell surface, be applied as mitogenic, cytotoxic and antimicrobial agents, and also be used as antiproliferative molecules for cancer cells. These proteins may be useful in water treatment due to their coagulant and antibacterial properties. Insecticidal lectins with potential biotechnological application for control of agricultural pests have also been described. There are pitfalls in lectin purification; among them is the structural similarity between contaminant proteins or other lectin molecular forms promoting difficulties to the purification process.

Results: The KAc and AB methods had a significant linear relationship to the PD- 10 method but the CPC did not.

Intra-plaque total and fractional GGT activity was determined by a cost-effective test of <b>molecular</b> size <b>exclusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> and compared with histological markers of plaque vulnerability. Plaque cholesterol content was also measured by chromatography. b-GGT was the only fraction detected within the atherosclerotic plaques and intra-plaque b-GGT activity correlated to plaque cholesterol content (r = 0. 667, P < 0. 0001), plasma b-GGT and f-GGT fractions (r = 0. 249; r ¼ 0. 298, both P < 0. 05). Higher b- GGT activity was found in thin-cap fibroatheromas and it was associated to histological markers of vulnerable plaques, i. e., larger necrotic areas, greater macrophage infiltration and higher cholesterol content (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: intra-plaque b-GGT activity correlates with the histological markers of vulnerable plaque and with plasma b-GGT in human carotid atherosclerosis; these data support the possible role of b-GGT in clinically significant atherosclerotic disease...|$|R
