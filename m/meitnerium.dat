5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of <b>meitnerium</b> {{has not received}} much attention recently. <b>Meitnerium</b> {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of <b>meitnerium</b> are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium.

The tetrahalides of <b>meitnerium</b> have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state.

40|$|Theoretical {{calculations}} {{show that}} {{in the region of}} the heaviest elements liquid drop fission barriers tend to decrease to zero, and the occurrence of nuclear shells is of special importance for the stability of nuclei [1, 2]. Experimentally, the influence of deformed sub-shells at Z = 108 and N = 162 has been confirmed, with the 20 -fold increase in half-life of 266 Sg 160 compared to 263 Sg 157 [3], the 300 -fold increase of 269 Hs 161 compared to 267 Hs 159 [4] and the recent discovery of 270 271 Hs 162 [5]. Production of Mt 162 would allow further examination of the N = 162 sub-shell. With a total dose of 4. 9 x 10 18 particles of 37 Cl at 195 ± 3 MeV (Center of Target), no events were seen that {{can be attributed to the}} production and subsequent decay of 271 Mt. A realistic calculation of the upper limit for the one event cross section is 1. 5 pb (shown in figure 1). We plan to run further experiments using 5 - 10 MeV higher projectile energies to examine the 4 n & 5 n exit channels. Reducing the MWAC thickness from 3. 3 to 2. 4 microns should increase the EVR implantation energy. We also plan to study the hot fusion cross section systematics using 238 U targets. Additionally, alpha decay of 271 Mt would provide more information on 267 Bh and 263 Db (alpha and sf) decay properties and, should the half-life of 271 Mt exceed 1 second, it might be possible to establish whether Mt behaves as a Group 9 element. Lighter Mt isotopes were first synthesized in 1982 by Münzenberg et al. [6]. <b>Meitnerium's</b> chemistry has never been studied due to the fact that its two known isotopes (266 Mt and 268 Mt) have half-lives much less than one second.

5|$|<b>Meitnerium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of <b>meitnerium</b> have been reported with atomic masses 266, 268, 270, and 274–278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have known but unconfirmed metastable states. A ninth isotope with atomic mass 282 is unconfirmed. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meitnerium</b> is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.4g/cm3, which would be the second-highest of any of the 118 known elements, second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium (41g/cm3). In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>meitnerium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. <b>Meitnerium</b> is also predicted to be paramagnetic.|$|E
5|$|All <b>meitnerium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known <b>meitnerium</b> isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of 67seconds.) A metastable nuclear isomer, 270mMt, {{has been reported to}} also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known <b>meitnerium</b> isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted to have half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found to have half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meitnerium</b> is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with <b>meitnerium</b> as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E

5|$|<b>Meitnerium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982. It is named for Lise Meitner.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium.

In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3.

5|$|In 1994 a {{committee}} of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hahnium (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn, after an older suggestion of ottohahnium (Oh) {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name, so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (<b>meitnerium)</b> would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This was because they felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society, IUPAC relented and the name hassium (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body-centered cubic crystal structure, similar to its lighter congener tungsten.

The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of 282Nh, 287Mc, 288Mc, 294Ts, and 290Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about tenmilliseconds for 262mBh to about oneminute for 270Bh and 274Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed 278Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.|$|E

Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it [...] "element 109", with the symbol of E109, (109) or even simply 109, or used the proposed name [...] "meitnerium".|$|E
500|$|An {{experiment}} {{determining the}} chemical properties of a transactinide {{would need to}} compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds {{of some of its}} lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of <b>meitnerium,</b> the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3).
