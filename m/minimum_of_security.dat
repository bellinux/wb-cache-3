One {{of circulation}} modus of narkoba done by the convicts in The Institute of social with existence of case convict narkoba can continuing its(the business only by using telephone seluler. Social is activity to do construction of Warga Binaan social based on system, institution, and way of construction which is ending of crime system in arranging criminal justice. Strategic position owned The Institute of social (Lapas) remembers the only institution or The Institute of which very in direct corollation to construction of lawbreaker (convict) and security and safety is conditio sine qua non to execute of construction programs. Along of that is safe situation and order need to be created. In this opportunity writer lays open problems about how security and safety system in construction of convict narkoba in The Institute of social Kelas IIA Pamekasan, factor any kind of supporting and constraint faced by officer in execution of security and safety system of The Institute of social for convict narkoba and how effort overcomes constraints happened to reach of execution effectivity of security and safety system of The Institute of social for convict narkoba. Writing method applied by writer is approach of yuridis sosiologis, that is writer express phenomenon happened in The Institute of social of narcotic to be found a fact and solution based on by regulation rule of perundang invitation applied related to and the law theory. Hereinafter is found solving of problem from phenomenon emerging the. Based on result of research it is got that construction of convict narkoba in The Institute of social of Klas IIA Pamekasan still be made one with construction of public convict. This thing still becoming factor is less maximumly of builder in executing construction, especially to convict narkoba. While security and safety system which research writer is for responsibilities of security and safety and orderliness of Lapas stays is full on-hand Kepala Lapas. Security and safety system applied in Lapas Klas IIA Pamekasan is Sistem Keamanan Individual, Group Security And Safety System, Security and safety System of Mixture and executed as according to step Maximal Security, Medium security, a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> For creation of condition of security and safety which kondusif in Lapas Klas IIA Pamekasan, hence execution of security and safety program in for becoming four security and safety shifts which in its entirety in implementing by KPLP. Conclusion which can be taken that is security and safety system and construction of convict narkoba in The Institute of social of Klas IIA Pamekasan can be told has not is effective because still be mingled it between convicts narkoba with common convict causing needs existence of The Institute of special social about crime convict narkoba...|$|E

The decomposition mechanism is adopted and the proportional distribution is used to maintain diversity of the new found nondominated solutions. Finally, the Pareto optimal solutions are analyzed by simulation, and the optimal MACSIA schemes of each jamming aircraft suppression against the enemy air defense radar network are obtained and verify that the built multiobjective optimization model is corrected.

40|$|The {{security}} that passwords provide could be seriously flawed {{due to the}} way people cope with having to memorize and recall their passwords. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard {{that is used to}} measure the password strength, known as entropy, is designed for a single use and does not consider that users may choose to keep parts of their password across password changes. This study shows that a portion of users keep some information from previous passwords across changes. These habits which will be called coping mechanisms that over time serve to erode the protection provided by passwords past the <b>minimum</b> level <b>of</b> <b>security</b> provided by the password policy which can place both individuals and enterprises into danger.

Recent work on ‘nationwide health {{information network}}’ architectures has sought to share highly confidential data over insecure networks such as the Internet. Using basic patterns of health network data flow and trust models to support secure communication between network nodes, we abstract network security requirements to a core set to enable secure inter-network data sharing. We propose a <b>minimum</b> set <b>of</b> <b>security</b> controls that can be implemented without needing major new technologies, but yet realize network security and privacy goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability. This framework combines a set of technology mechanisms with environmental controls, and is shown to be sufficient to counter commonly encountered network security threats adequately...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes that}} text adventures be studied {{as the basis}} for {{alternative}} text-based authentication. This includes creating a text-based virtual environment where user authentication involves the user entering commands that include interacting with objects and navigating between rooms as their “password. ” Three exemplar proposals are implemented and analyzed. The first two examples provide theoretical password spaces comparable to PIN or text passwords, and are designed against given threat models. The third example is designed to offer resistance to keyloggers due to a randomly varying user password based upon a selected authentication portfolio. By leveraging the ability for the user to interact with a text-based virtual world, we show {{that it is possible to}} design a scheme that maintains a <b>minimum</b> level <b>of</b> <b>security</b> comparable to text passwords with this novel approach...|$|R
