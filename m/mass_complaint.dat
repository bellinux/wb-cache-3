40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the clinical features of dermoid cysts, which are orbital benign congenital choristomas, and {{the findings of}} accompanying inflammation. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight patients were analyzed retrospectively, who underwent mass excision with the prediagnosis of dermoid cyst, between February 2008 -January 2012, in our clinic and were diagnosed with dermoid cyst with histopathological examination. All patients underwent routine ophthalmological examination and radiological imaging. The localization of dermoid cyst in patients, the presence of inflammation in radiological and histopathological examinations, excavation of bone tissue, adhesion of the surrounding tissue and histologically content were evaluated. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) test was used for statistical analysis. P-value lower than 0. 05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: The mean age {{of a total of}} 48 patients; 26 female and 22 male was determined as 14. 5 ± 14. 8 years (1 - 59 years, median age 9 years). In addition to <b>mass</b> <b>complaint</b> in all patients, pain in two patients (4. 1...|$|E
40|$|Granular cell tumor (GCT) {{was first}} {{described}} by Abrikossoff in 1926. GCT is a rarely seen soft tissue tumor and is generally benign. While the tumor {{can be seen}} {{in all parts of the}} body it is generally located on the head and neck region, and especially on the tongue. GCT is rarely seen in the anal-perianal region. In accordance with literature this case was reported because it was thought to be the 27 th anal-perianal located GCT case. In this case report, approximately 0, 5 - 1 cm pedunculated polypoid lesion was determined in the perianal region during the physical examination of a 23 year old female patient who applied with palpable <b>mass</b> <b>complaint</b> in the perianal region. Lesion in the patient was totally excited with healthy skin-subcutaneous tissue under local anesthesia. A benign granular cell tumor was detected in the histopathological examination. Positive staining was monitored immunohistochemically with S- 100 and neuron specific enolase (NSE). GCT is a rarely seen tumor in the anal-perianal region and its malign transformation rate is very low. Even lesions seen in the perianal region have clinically a benign appearance, a histopathological examination should be conducted and also GCT should be kept in mind during diagnosis. Malign-benign separation of these lesions is difficult so histopathological examination should be conducted with great care. Large local excision in the treatment provides curative treatment. But for those presenting malign transformation further examination must be performed for metastasis. After the treatment local recurrence and metastasis should be considered carefully. Prognosis of metastatic disease is very bad...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{historically}} significant <b>mass</b> <b>complaints</b> regarding Qwest involved {{allegations that the}} then-long-distance-only company switched local telephone service customers over to Qwest's long-distance service without their permission, an illegal practice known as slamming. In July 2000, Qwest paid a $1.5 million fine to the Federal Communications Commission to resolve slamming complaints. In April 2001, they paid a $350,000 fine to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection after the state cited them for deceptive advertising and slamming practices. The company's settlements included a requirement that all of its sales employees sign a pledge stating that slamming was barred and a condition for dismissal from Qwest employment.|$|R
40|$|Background. To assess Cutler-Beard {{procedure}} {{results in}} patients after wide excision of malignant eyelid tumours. Materials and Methods. The records {{of two women}} and two men (four patients) referred to our clinic with eyelid <b>mass</b> <b>complaints</b> and malign eyelid tumour diagnosis according to the histopathological examination were examined retrospectively. Results. The patients were 60 – 73 years old and their average age was 66 ± 11. 10. The follow-up period of the cases was 16 (6 – 25) months. Total excisional biopsy was applied to all patients and then Cutler-Beard full thickness lid reconstruction was done because of the wide localization of the tumour. The patients’ diagnoses were consistent with basal cell carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, eyelid lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The patients’ eyelids were separated from each other 1 month postoperatively with a second operation. Superior eyelid entropium and blepharochalasis were seen in one patient during followup. Conclusions. Cutler-Beard flap is a successful procedure for superior eyelid tumours accompanied by wide tissue loss. The long-time closure of the eyelids {{and the need for}} secondary surgery are the major disadvantages of this procedure. Our experience with this procedure will reveal better results with large case series...|$|R
500|$|The council {{launches}} several media campaigns a year {{against the}} producers and advertisers of television programs they {{perceive to be}} indecent. A typical campaign involves press releases declaring a particular program harmful (often with a tally of [...] "unacceptable" [...] character behavior or situations), the organized mass mailing of form letters and emails to advertising sponsors of unapproved programs, organized <b>mass</b> filing of <b>complaints</b> via the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website complaint form, and direct threats of long, potentially costly FCC license challenges to local network affiliates planning to broadcast what the council considers harmful network programming.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conception}} of Adrift {{was a direct}} result from the events that occurred to Adam Orth in 2013. When Microsoft's Xbox One was announced, it received controversy for its digital rights management that would require users to remain online to use the console. After seeing people quarrel over this, Orth—then a creative director at Microsoft—told them to [...] "deal with it", {{which resulted in a}} <b>mass</b> of <b>complaints</b> leading to Orth's resignation from the company. This led him to move from Seattle to Southern California. Orth noted that the game is a metaphor, comparing it to the events in his life; both Orth and the player character find themselves {{in the middle of a}} disaster, and must [...] "do the hard work to put things together". He has stated that the game is about [...] "action, consequence and redemption". Orth wrote the story without any science fiction or supernatural themes in mind, stating that he [...] "wanted to make stories and characters that hopefully resonate with people because they're not typical video game stories".|$|R
40|$|Melanoma of {{the canal}} anal is a rare {{malignancy}} and due {{to the site of}} the lesion and the lack of early presenting signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is usually delayed (1, 2, 3). There is a peak incidence during the seventh decade of life and a marked predominance of female patients, being the hemorrhage, anal pain or anal <b>mass</b> the main <b>complaints.</b> Histologically, it is characterized by a great cellular vari-ability, being able to mimic several other histological types. Thus the immunohistochemical stains, such as S 100 protein and the HMB- 45, became a useful instrument in establishing the correct diagnosis. Although it’s a situation that folows with a very low long-term survival, there is no consensus in the best treatment option (3, 5, 6). Case repor...|$|R
40|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} entity {{accounting for}} 0. 5 % to 5 % of parathyroid neoplasia. Most of these malignancies present as functional hormone-producing masses with elevated serum levels of parathormone and calcium. These tumors may also be nonfunctional. Clinical detection of nonfunctioning parathyroid malignancies preoperatively is primarily based on symptoms of an expanding neck <b>mass.</b> This ominous <b>complaint</b> is typically accompanied with an advanced stage of the disease at initial diagnosis. Because there is a paucity of data in the literature regarding nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma, prognosis can not be readily assessed. In both functional and nonfunctional parathyroid carcinoma, early surgery {{has proven to be}} the only curative treatment approach whereas both chemotherapy and radiation therapy fail to produce systemic or regional benefit when used alone. Hence, parathyroid cancer should be considered in every patient evaluated for a neck mass regardless of the blood calcium and blood parathormone level...|$|R
2500|$|HBO became {{involved}} in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that {{would have resulted in}} some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher II system; this initially resulted in a <b>mass</b> lodge of <b>complaints</b> from television receive-only (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription. The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself [...] "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a text-based message placed over SMPTE color bars in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall for committing the intrusion.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} of the early 1950s new {{technological}} motive power was introduced onto Queensland Railways, when the first diesel-electric locomotives (DEL) arrived from the General-Electric Company. The new motive power was revolutionary and did not require the labour-intensive maintenance and preparation, nor produce the dirty environment of steam locomotives. The first DELs to be shedded at Rockhampton were in 1966, for use on export coal traffic. Prior to this DELs were worked through on the main line from Brisbane to Cairns. Diesel-electric locomotives were serviced at a separate location in the Rockhampton yard. With the introduction of the new technology, withdrawals of steam locomotives took place. The final steam locomotive was overhauled in Rockhampton Workshops in 1969. The roundhouse was officially closed to steam traction on 29 September 1969.Following closure as a steam depot the roundhouse was then used as a wagon repair and maintenance centre from 1969 until 1988 for wooden bodied vehicles. The roof was completely rebuilt in 1976-8 with hardwood timber being used to replace original pine framing. In 1982-3 in several stalls old concrete slabs were replaced with <b>mass</b> concrete, following <b>complaints</b> from employees. Carriage lifting gear and machinery was also installed at this time, as a partial modernisation of the working environment. In 1983 an office for subforemen was also built into one of the stalls in the roundhouse. In 1988 one of the bays was converted into a store area for breakdown equipment. The roundhouse was utilised as a wagon repair shop until 1990. In 1992-3 as part of a $20 million redevelopment of the Rockhampton Workshops, an administration complex was inserted into two bays of the south- eastern axis of the roundhouse, adjacent to the entry/exit road.|$|R
