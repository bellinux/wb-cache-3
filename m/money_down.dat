5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the <b>money</b> <b>down</b> to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{breakdown}} in central authority {{that accompanied the}} civil war, {{which began in the}} early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the Somaliland territory, subsequently emerged. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. Competition for seigniorage drove the value of the <b>money</b> <b>down</b> to about $0.04 per ShSo (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost.

25|$|With {{civil war}} looming {{in the summer}} of 1642, Fisher and Barker worked through local landed gentry {{networks}} to mobilise support for the Puritan and Parliamentarian causes. Much was hoped of Newport, who was closely connected by marriage and proximity: Newport's sister, Margaret, had been married to John Barker, Walter's brother from whom he had inherited the estate, and his home at High Ercall Hall made him a close neighbour. Fisher did all he could to persuade Newport to side with Parliament, with the help of Barker's cousin, Robert Charlton of Apley Castle. However, a local royalist gentry circle around Francis Ottley pre-empted their efforts, seizing control of Shrewsbury and inviting Charles I to bring his army from Nottingham to occupy the town. Charlton and Barker tried to send a large sum of <b>money</b> <b>down</b> the River Severn to the Parliamentarians at Bristol but it was intercepted by the Sheriff, John Welde, at Bridgnorth. Charlton escaped but Barker was detained. Newport, after affecting indecision, gave the king Â£6000 in exchange for becoming Baron Newport. Fisher seems to have fled the scene, perhaps to London. There is no record of a replacement being installed at Upton Magna.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the <b>money</b> <b>down</b> on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Harvard-educated German {{businessman}} Ernst Hanfstaengl {{attended the}} 25th anniversary reunion {{of his class}} of 1909, and gave a number of speeches, including the 1934 commencement address. Hanfstaengl wrote out a check for 2,500 Reichsmarks (roughly equivalent to [...] as of [...] ) to Conant for a scholarship to enable an outstanding Harvard student to study for a year in Germany. [...] The President and Fellows of Harvard College rejected the offer due to Hanfstaengl's Nazi associations. When the issue of Hanfstaengl's scholarship came up again in 1936, Conant turned the <b>money</b> <b>down</b> a second time. Hanfstaengl's presence on campus prompted a series of anti-Nazi demonstrations, in which a number of Harvard and MIT students were arrested. Conant made a personal plea for clemency that resulted in two girls being acquitted, but six boys and a girl were sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
500|$|Marketing to {{an influx}} of {{immigrant}} workers, owners abandoned [...] "adult only" [...] policies (prohibiting children), listed vacancies in Spanish, and reduced rents. Despite the rent reduction, a July 17, 1988 Houston Chronicle article stated that rates for poorly maintained apartments in Gulfton and other Houston areas were comparable to well-maintained apartments {{in other parts of}} the city. According to Gaines, complexes in Gulfton began to cater to illegal immigrants and landlords allowed renters to [...] "double-up" [...] housing (several individuals and/or families living in a unit). John Goodner, a Houston city council member who represented a district that included Gulfton at that time, said that more demographic changes occurred within his district in the years leading up to 1988 than in any other part of the city. He was referring to the shift in the demographics of various apartment complexes. Goodner said that the complex owners were unconcerned about this development as long as the rent payments were made. Landlords had difficulty filling apartment complexes even if they did not require background checks. Many banks and lending institutions owned foreclosed apartments and failed to properly maintain them, considering it [...] "pouring <b>money</b> <b>down</b> a perceived rat hole." [...] Gaines added that many complexes deferred maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|Cash {{was last}} arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found he was {{carrying}} a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the <b>money</b> <b>down.</b> The singer was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school. Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: [...] "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 21st and Lehigh {{was one of}} the gloomiest {{addresses}} {{in baseball}} in the late 1930s and early 1940s. At the time, both Philadelphia teams {{were in the midst of}} long stretches of futility. The Phillies had notched only one winning season since 1918, while the A's had not had a winning season since 1933. Both teams finished last in their respective leagues in 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1945. Making things worse was that Phillies owner Gerald Nugent was mired in debt to both Mack and the National League, and other NL owners were grumbling about the dismal [...] "gates" [...] that their Philly trips earned them. In 1943 Nugent agreed in principle to sell the Phillies to Bill Veeck, only to have that sale derailed by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis's objections to Veeck's plans to stock the Phillies with Negro League stars. [...] The league took over the franchise and sold it to lumber baron William Cox, who paid off Mack and put <b>money</b> <b>down</b> on future rent. While the flamboyant Cox did pour money into the team in an effort to turn it around, he also abraded fans, his own players, fellow owners and Landis. The uproar did not last long, though: when Cox was found to be betting on Phillies games, Landis banned him for life in short order.|$|E
2500|$|Prostitution was not legal, but {{was very}} common during the Empire. The prostitutes were often women {{who came from}} the provinces seeking work, or women who had {{part-time}} jobs but could not survive on their small salaries. In 1810, when Paris had {{a population of about}} 600,000 persons, the Minister of Police, Savary, estimated that there were 8000 to 9000 women working in maisons closes, or houses of prostitution; 3000 to 4000 who worked out of a rented room; 4000 who worked out of doors, in parks, courtyards, or even cemeteries; and 7000 to 8000 who were prostitutes when money ran short, who were otherwise employed in sewing, selling bouquets of flowers, or other low-paid professions. This accounted in total for five to eight percent of the female population of the city. [...] According to one account from 1814, they had their own social hierarchy; the courtesans at the top, whose clients were exclusively the noble or wealthy; then a class composed of actresses, dancers, and those from the theater world; then semi-respectable prostitutes from the middle class who sometimes received clients at home, often with the husband's consent; then unemployed or working-women who needed <b>money,</b> <b>down</b> to the lowest level, who were found in the city's worst neighborhoods, the Port du BlÃ©, the rue PurgÃ©e, and rue Planche Mibray.|$|E
