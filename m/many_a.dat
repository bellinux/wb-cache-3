5|$|Although ancient Lapita potteries {{date back}} to 1500 BC, {{and the people of}} the island have long been {{involved}} in the arts, since the establishment of the ADCK, Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia. Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are popular as is flèche faîtière, a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes. Music, dance and singing are part of <b>many</b> <b>a</b> Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors.|$|E
5|$|He {{relocated}} {{to the town}} of Edmonton in 1892, becoming the town's first architect. He also operated a brickyard upon settling. In 1892, Edmiston, working independently at the time, was contracted by the Edmonton Town Council to draft a map of the town. In that same year, he was also a member of a committee tasked with a project to establish a brewery in Edmonton. In 1893, he established a partnership with local architect Nathaniel G. Flater, and operated under the name Edmiston & Flater, headquartered at the Edmonton Imperial Bank Building. The firm designed many notable buildings for the town, including the first post office, the city's first brick school (for the Edmonton Public School District), the All Saints' Anglican Cathedral, a home for Herbert Charles Wilson, the McDougall & Secord retail store, and a fire hall. In 1899, he would end his partnership with Flater and enter into a new one, with Henry D. Johnson of Calgary, under the firm name Edmiston & Johnson Architects, Draughtsmen, Valuators and Insurance Agents. This firm was responsible for constructing, amongst <b>many,</b> <b>a</b> hospital building, a new Presbyterian church and making alterations to the Robertson Hall Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Music, {{dance and}} singing {{are part of}} <b>many</b> <b>a</b> Kanak {{ceremonial}} function such as initiation, courting and mourning. Conch shells are blown by an appointed person to represent a clan chief’s arrival or the voice of an ancestor. Rhythm instruments used include Bwanjep, used during ceremonies {{by a group of}} men; Jew's harp, (wadohnu in the Nengone language where it originated) made of dried piece of coconut palm leaf held between the teeth and an attached segment of soft nerve leaf; coconut-leaf whizzer, a piece of coconut leaf attached to a string and twirled that produces a noise like a humming bee; oboe, made of hollow grass stems or bamboo; end-blown flute, made of 50cm long hollowed pawpaw leaf stem; bamboo stamping tubes that are struck vertically against the ground and played at major events; percussion instruments (hitting sticks, palm sheaths); rattles that are worn on the legs made of coconut leaves, shells and certain fruits. Kanak groups such as Bethela first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976.|$|E

5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. <b>Many</b> <b>a</b> baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities {{as far away as}} Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch <b>many</b> <b>a</b> summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but <b>many</b> <b>a</b> muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While <b>many</b> <b>a</b> general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E
