5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over <b>McCain</b> <b>in</b> childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing <b>McCain</b> <b>in</b> delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led <b>McCain</b> <b>in</b> national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} {{primaries}} on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates {{to become the}} presumptive nominee. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; {{at the time of}} the clinching, Clinton had 286superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over <b>McCain</b> <b>in</b> the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E
