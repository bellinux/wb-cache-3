On the Persian side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and also suggests that the survivors <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Sardis.|$|E

5|$|Back in Egypt, {{and after}} {{a short period of}} rest, Kippenberger set about {{rebuilding}} the battalion, which had lost over half its original complement. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks as they <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
2500|$|Nineteenth-century Russian writers, {{starting}} with Ivan Zabelin, emphasized {{the influence of}} the vernacular wooden churches of the Russian North; <b>their</b> motifs <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> into masonry, particularly the votive churches that did not need to house substantial s. David Watkin also wrote of a blend of Russian and Byzantine roots, calling the cathedral [...] "the climax" [...] of Russian vernacular wooden architecture.|$|R

5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into The Well of Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Agârbiceanu and {{his family}} found shelter with a Transylvanian family in Borogani village, near Leova in Bessarabia.

50|$|The Fairfaxes, meanwhile, having {{escaped from}} Adwalton Moor, <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> {{separately}} to Hull, then {{the only remaining}} Parliamentary stronghold in Yorkshire. Sir John Hotham, the military governor of Hull, was arrested and removed by Major-General Robert Overton {{and the people of}} Hull in July 1643 after conspiring with Newcastle to surrender the city. Lord Fairfax was invited to take up the post by the townsfolk of Hull on 22 July. He fortified Hull, established a base at Beverley, and set about vigorous raids on Royalist garrisons in Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Skiff amassed one of the most {{important}} private libraries in the United States, with particular emphases on literature and history.

5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the Weddell Sea had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface.

They then <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted they <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> far inland, but {{a wide variety of}} other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E

Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern area of conflict. Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the southern border, including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to the northern border by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} there would not be enough food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> out of the Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos.

Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
