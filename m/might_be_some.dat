5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

With the gradual desiccation of the Sahara, they headed south. Many of the Berber tribes claimed Yemeni (and sometimes other Arab) origins.

25|$|The bog {{in which}} the man was found {{is close to the}} border between Himle and Faurås {{hundreds}}. It is also close to the border between Rolfstorp, Sibbarp, Köinge and Svartrå parishes. The hundreds were responsible for the handling of murders, which meant that in this case there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> confusion over the correct hundred to handle the case, to the advantage of the killer(s). It has therefore been assumed that the killer(s) had good local knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Neumarkt am Wallersee. Laid out as {{a planned}} town for Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg around 1240 and {{referred}} to as ‘Novum Forum’. It was a strategically important position on the NW boundary of Archdiocese and initially {{appears to have been}} commercially successful, but the Medieval layout {{does not appear to have}} survived, In 1638 the Salzburg Cathedral architect Santino Solari was commissioned to either fortify or re-fortify the site by the Archbishop Paris Graf von Lodron. The surviving evidence on the ground is slight. There seem to be two or three pointed Italian trace bastions to the N of the Church and another to the S. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> form of Star fort, but quite possibly the fortifications were never completed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{efforts were}} rarely {{organised}}, those that were, were organised through the traditional social networks of the Islands; {{the absence of}} political parties and the weakness of trade unions meant that political networks that facilitated resistance in other countries were lacking in the Channel Islands. Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the Cold War and the barriers to communication. Communists and conscientious objectors, groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help {{in the way they}} hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Some</b> saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews – mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same social milieu. With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language.|$|E

Writers Weddle and Thompson considered giving the characters some leeway in interpreting what they had found.

500|$|Eastwood {{worked at}} a number of jobs, {{including}} lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University [...] but was then drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. [...] "He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort of hero. Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military," [...] commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, Sondra Locke. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings. While returning from a prearranged tryst in Seattle, Washington, he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam [...] to safety.|$|E
500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, {{when he was in the}} city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E

500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him.
