The {{first secretary of state}} to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> in the virtual age. As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012; in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor. Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013. Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had, and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the outcry}} over {{developments}} in Kansas {{strong in the}} North, defenders of slavery—increasingly committed to {{a way of life}} that abolitionists and their sympathizers considered obsolete or immoral—articulated a militant pro-slavery ideology that would lay the groundwork for secession upon the election of a Republican president. Southerners waged a vitriolic response to political change in the North. Slaveholding interests sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse [...] "hostile" [...] and [...] "ruinous" [...] legislation.

2500|$|With {{the chaos}} of the war, a working postal system was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and {{consequently}} letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the Blockade runners who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail {{in and out of the}} Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is Prisoner of War mail and Blockade mail as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with [...] has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Revolutionary Ideals are Higher than Heaven-Studying" [...] (published in 2013), a person writing under the pen name [...] "Autumn Stone", {{supports}} Xi Jinping's policy of strengthening the ideological conviction of party cadres, since (as the Leninist mantra goes) ideological unity leads to party unity. The writer claims [...] "Ideals and convictions are the spiritual banners {{for the united}} struggle of a country, nation and party, wavering ideals and convictions are the most harmful form of wavering." [...] Adhering to the ideals and convictions of the party creates {{a link between the}} party and the masses, and will let the party [...] "gain victories wherever" [...] it goes. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the core spiritual values of members have become <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> considering the restrengthened position of world capitalism. Xi Jinping believes that wavering conviction in the party's ideals lead to increased corruption and unwanted behaviour. Exemplary members have existed before, such as Xia Minghan who said [...] "Don’t fear being beheaded, as long as one’s ism is true", Yang Chao’s [...] "The heaven’s are full of rain, wind and worry, for the Revolution, it is unnecessary to fear losing one’s head" [...] and Fang Zhimin's statement that [...] "The enemy can only cut off our heads, but cannot shake our beliefs!" [...] The author suggest that these men were incorruptible because they carried the party's ideals and convictions. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, the writer suggests, was in key parts due to the ideological wavering of officials; claiming that even Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, had acknowledged in private that communist ideals had become obsolete to him. Disintegration in the ideological arena can lead to breaches {{in other areas of the}} party's edifice, paving the way for party collapse, the author states.|$|E
