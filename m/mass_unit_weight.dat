30|$|For {{the initial}} stress {{condition}} of the Donghekou rockslide, the slope angle of 25 degrees was used at the source area. The initial normal stress and shear stress {{were obtained from the}} slope angle, thickness of the sliding <b>mass,</b> and the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of the soil/rock. With the consideration of the capacity of the apparatus, a thickness of 20  m was used to replace the actual average thickness of 75  m. The <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of the sliding mass was assumed to be 18 kN/m 3. Statistically, under the same slope condition, larger scale landslides always show a higher mobility (Okuda [1984]). Theoretically, for an infinite long slope consisting of non-cohesive soils, the slope stability has no relationship with gravitational acceleration. Considering that the stress level in the simulation test is about 27 % of the actual, the initiation mechanism and motion mechanism of the Donghekou complex slide can be qualitatively interpreted. The actual failure should have a higher mobility than that shown in the laboratory test.|$|R

Control of the vector has been focused on integrated management involving strategic use of insecticides, use of vaccines, use of herbal acaricides and breed resistance. It has been established that tick vaccine is working on limiting the egg laying potentiality and subsequent hatchability of the ticks fed on immunized animals. To generate entomological data following immunization of animals against ticks an experiment was conducted to establish the role of water content in egg masses for successful hatching into larvae. Methods: Different size and shape of egg masses of Boophilus microplus, Izatnagar isolate were obtained by manipulating the egg laying process. The weight of the egg masses was measured, keeping their integrity and surface areas of respective egg masses were calculated with the aid of computer software.

40|$|SUMMARY: Knowledge of the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of Municipal Solid-Waste (MSW) is {{required}} for many engineering analyses. However, <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> {{continues to be a}} significant source of uncertainty in these analyses due to a variety of factors, including the heterogeneous nature of solid waste, a paucity of data, and the lack of systematic analysis of the available data. Analysis of available in-situ and laboratory data on the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of MSW, described herein, indicates both the existence of a “characteristic <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile ” for MSW and the need for site-specific <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> data to develop an accurate <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile for a particular landfill.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of element concentration data for X-ray microanalyses of biological tissues, which {{are subjected to}} some experimental treatment, can be complicated by changes in cell volume and total cell dry matter induced by the treatment. We have examined {{the manner in which}} such changes would affect the values measured in frozen-dried cryosections of soft tissues, and how they may be taken into account in the {{interpretation of}} the results. The element content (<b>mass</b> per <b>unit</b> dry <b>weight)</b> measured by the peak-to-continuum or Hall method is independent of changes in cell volume, but is sensitive to a change in the local dry mass. Conversely, intracellular concentrations in terms of <b>mass</b> per <b>unit</b> volume, as determined by the peripheral or internal standard technique, are dependent on volume changes but independent of dry mass. The estimated dry weight fraction is affected by changes in both volume and dry mass. The results obtained from both quantification methods can therefore provide information on the combination of changes in cellular element levels, volume and total dry mass that may occur following the experimental treatment. In a study of the late effect of the drug cisplatin on electrolyte concentrations in kidney proximal tubules, both quantification methods have been used to obtain wet weight and dry weight concentrations. By applying the above considerations, the analytical results have been interpreted as a combination of changes in element levels and a shrinkage of the tubule cells. Cell shrinkage was confirmed by morphometric analysis of tubular cross-sections...|$|R
30|$|The {{aggregate}} density {{played a}} major role in affecting the fresh <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of the mixes.

Only the total binder content affected the results of the 28 -day air and oven dry <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> of ESH mixtures. An increase in the total binder content increased both <b>unit</b> <b>weights.</b> This behavior might be attributed to the high absorption rate of aggregates (above 13  %) that slowed the evaporation rate of water from the mixture.

The Ohio's and the modified Ohio's curves can predict satisfactorily the compaction curves of the fine-grained soils, and lateritic soils and crushed rocks {{consistent with the}} grade B of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirement. The CBR value of a specific soil {{is directly related to}} the relative dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (the ratio of dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> to maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> γd/γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state. In practice, the excess roller pass is thus not economic. Based on the analysis of the test data, the field compaction procedure for road embankment and pavement constructions, which includes the material selection and the construction control, is suggested. It is useful in terms of both engineering and economic viewpoints...|$|R
