5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, {{and many of his}} decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks, for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 1934. Blackstone's decision in Goldswain's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950.|$|E

The Local Government Changes for England (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provision)</b> Regulations 1995 gave district councils in a [...] "county {{for which there is no}} county council and in which there is not more than one district" [...] the additional power to change the name of the county.

25|$|The {{principal}} statute {{regulating the}} selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 {{as amended by}} the Civil Law (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 2008. There is a fine of €500 for failing to report for jury service, though this was poorly enforced until a change of policy at the Courts Service in 2016. Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court. Juryless trials under the inadequacy exception, dealing with terrorism or organised crime, are held in the Special Criminal Court, on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Juries are also used in some civil law trials, such as for defamation; they are sometimes used at coroner's inquests.|$|E

The Senate version was introduced nine days later and sponsored by then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE). The Second Chance Act passed the House 347–62 on November 13, 2007. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 11, 2008, and the life of the NPREC was extended when Bush signed the Second Chance Act of 2007 on April 9, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's {{legal system}} is {{separate}} {{from those of}} England and Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the legal profession is divided between solicitors and advocates, the distinction being similar to that between solicitors and barristers in England and Wales, though Scottish solicitors have traditionally represented their clients in the lower courts (such as the Sheriff Court and the District Court), only being excluded from the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session. However, under Section 24 of the Law Reform (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> (Scotland) Act 1990, suitably qualified solicitors were {{for the first time}} in Scotland granted rights of audience in the Supreme Courts in Scotland as well as in the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as solicitor advocates.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{conservationist}} pressure, {{a nearby}} house, St Helen's, was declared a national monument. The house {{has since been}} refurbished as the five-star Radisson Blu Hotel. The lessons learned from Frescati have been used elsewhere. Hundreds of houses in the area were listed for preservation immediately after Frescati was demolished as a direct reaction. The Frescati case was considered {{in the final stages}} of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Bill, 1998 and buildings with cultural importance are now afforded greater protection through the act as a result. The large degree of neglect that Frescati suffered was a key tactic of the developers. Legislation was introduced recently in which owners of historic buildings can be punished by a prison term or a fine of up to one million pounds for negligence. This legislation was exercised when Archer's Garage in the South City, a listed building was demolished illegally in Dublin. The developers agreed to rebuild and Archer's Garage was subsequently rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Margereson {{was born}} in 1925 and lived {{approximately}} 200 yards away from Midland Works. Although he never worked at the factory, he lived {{all of his life}} in the same property in Armley except during his wartime military service, commencing in 1943, returning to the house after his service had ended. In September 1990 he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Although legal action was commenced in 1990, Arthur died from his cancer in 1991, and the case subsequently involved his widow, Evelyn, under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 and on behalf of her husband's estate under the Law Reform (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 1934. The case suffered many delays and setbacks, particularly due to the obstructive actions of the defendants, who for two years had resisted access to internal company documents which demonstrated they were aware of the risk in 1933, and was still unresolved {{by the time it was}} combined with the case of a second victim of environmental exposure, June Hancock, in 1994.Although separate cases, they were heard as one. A third plaintiff, David Young, died of his cancer in December 1993, but had no surviving family to continue his action against the company. A further 12 victims who were previously seeking compensation from T had also died before their cases reached court.|$|E

50|$|The fourth {{part of the}} Courts Act {{governs the}} {{selection}} of juries and related rules; it has since been repealed by the Juries Act 1974.

500|$|If {{property}} has {{not been}} transferred, the potential trustees and beneficiaries are volunteers, and an equitable maxim is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; the courts will {{not look at the}} case. To get around this, the courts have developed exceptions to this rule for situations when the settlor has done [...] "all that he could do", the trustees or beneficiaries have acquired the property in a different way, or where the gift was made donatio mortis causa. Formality refers to the specific language or forms used when transferring property. For chattels, no formal language or documentation is needed, unless it is made as a will. For land, the transfer must be drafted in line with the Law of Property Act 1925 and the Law of Property (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 1989. When disposing of an equitable interest, the Law of Property Act 1925 must also be followed; much of the case law in this area has centred on the meaning of [...] "dispose", with many cases involving people attempting to avoid tax.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} part of the nineteenth century, the Civil Contingencies Fund was created in the United Kingdom.

50|$|The Road Fund was a British Government fund {{designated}} {{to pay for}} {{the building}} and maintenance of the United Kingdom road network.

2500|$|Hong Kong {{insolvency}} law regulates {{the position of}} companies which are in financial distress and are unable to pay or provide for all of their debts or other obligations, and matters ancillary to and arising from financial distress.

[...] Prior to 2012 Cap 32 was called the Companies Ordinance, but when the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622) came into force in 2014, most of the provisions of Cap 32 were repealed except for the provisions relating to insolvency, which were retained and the statute was renamed to reflect its new principal focus.|$|E
2500|$|The Civil Law (<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act of 2011 first {{introduced}} legislation specifically addressing the liability of citizen good Samaritans or volunteers in the Republic of Ireland, without introducing {{a duty to}} intervene. [...] This act provides for exemption from liability for a person, or voluntary organisation, for anything done while providing [...] "assistance, advice or care" [...] {{to a person who}} is injured, in serious risk or danger of becoming injured or suffering from an illness (or apparently so). There are exclusions for cases of [...] "bad faith" [...] or [...] "gross negligence" [...] on behalf of the carer, and incidents relating to negligent use of motor vehicles. This Act only addresses situations where there is no duty of care owed by the good Samaritan or the volunteer.|$|E
2500|$|Curiously the Companies (Winding Up and <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Ordinance {{makes no}} express {{provision}} for insolvency set-off within the statute itself, and instead the relevant provisions are incorporated by reference from the Bankruptcy Ordinance. [...] Any sums which are owed by a creditor {{to the company}} are set-off against sums which are owed by the company to that creditor. [...] In order for insolvency set-off to operate there must be strict mutuality between the claims (in that the company and creditor must both be beneficially entitled to the relevant debts, not merely claimants as agents or trustees for another party). [...] The rules of insolvency set-off are mandatory, {{and it is not}} possible to contract out of them. [...] The right to insolvency set-off is not if the creditor was aware that a winding-up petition had been presented at the time credit was extended to the company.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Title VIII of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (H. R. 1314, P. L. 114 - 74) makes several {{changes to}} the Social Security programs. Among these changes is a {{temporary}} reallocation of the Social Security payroll taxes so that a larger share is deposited in the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund to {{extend the life of}} this trust fund beyond its current predicted exhaustion in 2016. Under this provision, the allocation of the 12. 40 % Social Security payroll tax assigned to the DI trust fund increases from 1. 80 % to 2. 37 % and the allocation to the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund decreases from 10. 60 % to 10. 03 %. These changes last through 2018. In addition, these provisions extend the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) demonstration authority for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, make changes to data and earnings reporting, and increase penalties for benefit fraud.
