40|$|Objective: There is {{considerable}} research {{evidence for the}} effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation {{in the treatment of}} depression. However, there is little information about its acceptability and outcomes in clinical settings. Method: This naturalistic study reports on a clinical repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation service that has been running in Adelaide, South Australia, SA, for, years. During this time, complete acute courses were provided to patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Patients received either sequential bilateral or right unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment involving either, or, sessions given over, or, weeks respectively. Data included patient demographic details, duration of depression, and medication {{at the beginning of their}} repetitive transcranial <b>magnetic</b> stimulation <b>course.</b> The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Results: Of those undergoing a first-time acute treatment course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, N, achieved remission, while a further, met the criteria for a response to treatment. Most patients, N, had previously been treated with five or more antidepressant medications, and, had previously received electroconvulsive therapy. Referral rates remained high over the, years, indicating acceptance of the treatment by referring psychiatrists. There were no significant adverse events, and the treatment was generally well tolerated. In all, patients, had a second course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and, patients had a third course, patients subsequently received maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Conclusion: This naturalistic study showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was well accepted by both psychiatrists and patients, and has good efficacy and safety. Furthermore, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can provide a useful treatment alternative as part of outpatient mental health services for people with depression.

Since the force on charges expressed by the Lorentz equation depends upon the relative motion of the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) to the conductor where the EMF is located it was speculated that in the case when the magnet rotates with the disk but a voltage still develops, the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) must therefore not rotate with the <b>magnetic</b> material (of <b>course</b> since it is the laboratory frame), while the effective definition of magnetic field frame or the [...] "effective/relative rotation of the field" [...] turns with no relative motion with respect to the conductive disk.|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic {{actuation}} is {{not limited}} to the use of Lorentz force to cause a mechanical displacement. Magnetostrictive actuators can also use the theory of magnetism to bring about displacement. Materials that change their shapes when exposed to magnetic fields can now be used to drive high-reliability linear motors and actuators.. An example is a nickel rod that tends to deform when it is placed in an external magnetic field. Another example is wrapping a series of electromagnetic induction coils around a metal tube in which a Terfenol-D material is placed. The coils generate a moving <b>magnetic</b> field that <b>courses</b> wavelike down the successive windings along the stator tube. As the traveling magnetic field causes each succeeding cross section of Terfenol-D to elongate, then contract when the field is removed, the rod will actually [...] "crawl" [...] down the stator tube like an inchworm. Repeated propagating waves of magnetic flux will translate the rod down the tube's length, producing a useful stroke and force output. The amount of motion generated by the material is proportional to the magnetic field provided by the coil system, which is a function of the electric current. This type of motive device, which features a single moving part, is called an elastic-wave or peristaltic linear motor. (view:Video of a Magnetostrictive micro walker) ...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} {{magnetic}} orientation in migratory birds, i. e. {{how they can}} perceive information from the Earth’s magnetic field and use it for orientation. To examine magnetoreception and {{the function of the}} light-dependent magnetic compass in birds, I performed behavioural orientation experiments with European robins, Erithacus rubecula, under different spectra and intensities of light. The birds were well-oriented under low-intensity 560. 5 nm green light, but completely disoriented under 567. 5 nm green-yellow light. Under low-intensity red light (617. 0 nm) the birds shifted their preferred direction. This indicates that birds might possess at least two antagonistically interacting, magnetically sensitive spectral mechanisms, a short-wavelength mechanism in the blue-green and a long-wavelength mechanism in the red part of the spectrum. Five papers in this thesis are based on experiments carried out during an expedition to northern Canada. By displacing juvenile and adult birds across the Canadian tundra to areas beyond their normal experience and repeatedly testing their orientation we could (1) study the orientation and navigation abilities of inexperienced and experienced birds, (2) test the sensitivity of the magnetic compass at steep angles of inclination and (3) examine the use of magnetic and celestial compasses at geographic latitudes where the properties of the geomagnetic field change rapidly across longitudes and where the midnight sun makes star compass orientation impossible. White-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, and Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, oriented towards the seasonally expected migratory directions with access to magnetic compass cues only. White-crowned sparrows could select a <b>magnetic</b> compass <b>course</b> in <b>magnetic</b> fields with an inclination deviating by only 1. 4 ° from the vertical, but were disoriented at the magnetic North Pole. The change in orientation shown by both juvenile and adult white-crowned sparrows as a reaction to changing declination along the eastward displacement shows that these birds were aware of their position relative to home. In cue-conflict experiments, the birds shifted their preferred direction according to an artificial deflection of the magnetic field and recalibrated their celestial compasses, thus prioritized magnetic compass information in favour of celestial cues. By extrapolating potential migration routes from the empirical data collected during the expedition we could on a theoretical basis study the feasibility of using different compasses to reach the expected goals. Finally, I investigated the interrelationship and calibration between magnetic and celestial compass cues in a review of the existing literature and described how the different compasses might interact...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{present the}} {{development}} of a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) imaging system using targeted magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) as contrast agents. The contrast agents are functionalized for targeting by the conjugation of the magnetic NPs to folic acid (FA) molecules on dendrimer scaffolds. Cellular internalization is accomplished through the high-affinity folic acid receptors (FARs), which are overexpressed in various human carcinomas. SQUID can be applied to detect signals from the magnetic cores of the contrast agents and hence diagnose the tumor. Based on the magnetic properties of the magnetic NPs, two detection methods were developed: remanence and magnetorelaxometry (MRX). The remanence measurement-based method detects magnetic NPs that are sufficiently large and possess long relaxation time. Samples were vertically oscillated and horizontally translated each in one-dimension. The system was calibrated with y-Fe 2 O 3 NPs (mean diameter 25 nm) and the detection limit was found to be 10 ng at a distance of 1. 7 cm and the spatial resolution was ~ 1 cm. A theoretical model of this system was proposed and applied to image reconstruction of scanned phantoms with two NP injection spots. The developed SQUID system can determine not only the amount and horizontal position of the NPs, but also their depth in the phantoms. The MRX technique utilizes the NPs superparamagnetic property and records their time <b>course</b> <b>magnetic</b> decay. The system was investigated by using a number of iron oxide NP products with different mean diameters. The results showed that the MRX signal intensity is sensitively dependent {{on the size of the}} NPs. The best detection limit of 300 ng of total iron content was found on using a d = 12 nm Fe 3 O 4 NP sample and this result was supported by computer simulations. To produce magnetic NPs for the MRX study, a synthetic approach of size-controllable Fe 3 O 4 NPs was developed. Accordingly, the magnetic property can be tuned from ferromagnetic to superparamagnetic. In vitro experiments were conducted after functionalization of the synthesized NPs, which showed enhancement in cell targeting of the FA-modified NPs...|$|R
