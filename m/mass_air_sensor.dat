40|$|In {{this paper}} we design an {{adaptive}} air charge estimator for turbocharged diesel engines using intake manifold pressure, temperature and engine speed measurements. This adaptive observer scheme {{does not depend}} on <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>sensors</b> and can be applied to diesel engines with no exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The performance of the adaptive scheme is shown in simulations to be comparable to conventional air charge estimation schemes if perfect temperature measurements are available. The designed scheme cannot estimate fast transients and its performance deteriorates with temperature sensor lags. Despite all these difficulties, this paper demonstrates that (i) the proposed scheme has better robustness to modelling errors because it provides a closed-loop observer design, and (ii) robust air charge estimation is achievable even without <b>air</b> flow <b>sensors</b> if good (fast) temperature sensors become available.

5000|$|The 3.6 was {{the first}} AJ6 engine, debuting in 1983 on the XJ-S. It had DOHC 4-valve heads with a 91 mm bore and 92 mm stroke. Power was [...] with 325 Nm of torque. Power was reduced to [...] for {{versions}} having catalytic exhaust system. Early versions of the 3.6L AJ6 as used in the 1984 - 1987 XJ-S cars had a conventional distributor type of ignition system with electronics within the distributor body. This early AJ6 ignition system is nearly identical to the system used on the XK engine in the Series III XJ6 cars. The Lucas fuel injection system on the 3.6L AJ6 engines in these early XJ-S cars sensed engine load using a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor just like the V12 cars from the same era. Later 3.6L AJ6 engines as used in the 1986-1989 XJ40 cars had a crank-sensor type of ignition system with a bare distributor that only carried the spinning ignition rotor inside the distributor cap. The fuel-injection system used on the later 3.6L AJ6 engines used a hot-wire <b>Mass</b> <b>Air</b> Flow <b>sensor</b> to determine engine load.|$|R
5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake <b>Air</b> Temperature <b>sensor)</b> was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a <b>Mass</b> <b>Air</b> Flow system. This system uses a <b>Mass</b> <b>Air</b> Flow <b>Sensor</b> {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the work completed over a two and one half year effort {{sponsored by the}} US Department of Energy. The goal was to demonstrate the technology needed to produce a highly efficient engine enabled by several technologies which were to be developed {{in the course of}} the work. The technologies included: (1) A low-pressure direct injection system; (2) A <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> which would measure the net airflow into the engine on a per cycle basis; (3) A feedback control system enabled by measuring ionization current signals from the spark plug gap; and (4) An infinitely variable cam actuation system based on a pneumatic-hydraulic valve actuation These developments were supplemented by the use of advanced large eddy simulations as well as evaluations of fuel air mixing using the KIVA and WAVE models. The simulations were accompanied by experimental verification when possible. In this effort a solid base has been established for continued development of the advanced engine concepts originally proposed. Due to problems with the valve actuation system a complete demonstration of the engine concept originally proposed was not possible. Some of the highlights that were accomplished during this effort are: (1) A forward-backward <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> has been developed and a patent application for the device has been submitted. We are optimistic that this technology will have a particular application in variable valve timing direct injection systems for IC engines. (2) The biggest effort on this project has involved the development of the pneumatic-hydraulic valve actuation system. This system was originally purchased from Cargine, a Swedish supplier and is in the development stage. To date we have not been able to use the actuators to control the exhaust valves, although the actuators have been successfully employed to control the intake valves. The reason for this is the additional complication associated with variable back pressure on the exhaust valves when they are opened. As a result of this effort, we have devised a new design and have filed for a patent on a method of control which is believed to overcome this problem. The engine we have been working with originally had a single camshaft which controlled both the intake and exhaust valves. Single cycle lift and timing control was demonstrated with this system. (3) Large eddy simulations and KIVA based simulations were used in conjunction with flow visualizations in an optical engine to study fuel air mixing. During this effort we have devised a metric for quantifying fuel distribution and it is described in several of our papers.

Bosch D-Jetronic was a very early version of multi-point EFI, the “D” stood for “drucksensorgesteuert” (pressure sensor regulated). Unlike later Bosch fuel injection system, the injection was direct to the cylinder instead of via the Plenum inlets, which meant the a specific cylinder head was manufactured specifically for the engine, making this model unique and expensive to produce and purchase.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the air fuel ratio within the stoichiometric operating window, which is necessary for efficient catalytic converter operation an accurate estimation of the mass airflow at the engine ports is critical. It is difficult to accurately represent the port <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> flow of an Internal Combustion Spark Ignition engine as reciprocating engines are complex non-linear systems based on a large number of interrelated parameters. Conventional air fuel ratio control strategies use a number of three dimensional feedforward look up tables to represent these complex nonlinear engine functions. These look up tables are usually functions of only two engine variables, engine speed and engine load. Engine load is either, calculated from the speed density relationship using an absolute manifold <b>air</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> or measured directly using a <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor.</b> Conventional AFR control algorithms perform poorly during transient conditions as the strategies inherent in look up tables, are based on stationary or non-dynamic modelling techniques. Modern air fuel ratio control strategies employ a large number of correction factors to compensate for transient engine operation. This research is a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of using Artificial Neural Networks to represent transient nonlinear engine functions. This research develops offline artificial neural network models of the port <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> flow of a Spark Ignition, based on Hendricks' et al [1] accepted mean value engine model description of the manifold filling phenomena.

In an attempt to ensure durability and longevity, Subaru chose to use five main crankshaft bearings. The engine has either single or double overhead camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The ignition utilized distributorless ignition, using a computer-controlled coil pack and spark plug wires to supply the electrical charge. Later versions of this engine used coil packs installed directly {{on top of the}} spark plug. Problems detected by the cars' on-board computers are signified by a [...] "check engine" [...] light, alerting the driver that maintenance is needed immediately. The air-fuel mixture is monitored by a <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> and emissions are controlled by an oxygen sensor installed in front of a catalytic converter. It also uses reverse flow engine cooling, meaning cool water from the radiator entered the cylinder heads first and then exited through the top of the engine block back into the top of the radiator. The water flow was controlled by the thermostat which is located next to the water pump underneath the engine. Installing the thermostat in this position allows it to more accurately control the temperature of the water as it enters the engine from the cylinder heads first, thereby better preventing an occurrence of thermal shock.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow (MAF) <b>sensor</b> error {{compensation}} and an online updating error map (or lookup table) due to installation and aging in a diesel engine is developed. Since the MAF sensor error {{is dependent on}} the engine operating point, the error model is represented as a two-dimensional (2 D) map with two inputs, fuel mass injection quantity and engine speed. Meanwhile, the 2 D map representing the MAF sensor error is described as a piecewise bilinear interpolation model, which can be written as a dot product between the regression vector and parameter vector using a membership function. With the combination of the 2 D map regression model and the diesel engine air path system, an LPV adaptive observer with low computational load is designed to estimate states and parameters jointly. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proven under the conditions of persistent excitation and given inequalities. The observer is validated against the simulation data from engine software enDYNA provided by Tesis. The results demonstrate that the operating point-dependent error of the MAF sensor can be approximated acceptably by the 2 D map from the proposed method...|$|R
