40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex reflects a transient process that protects preattentive processing of the prepulse was investigated. Participants {{were presented with}} pairs of blink-eliciting noises, with some noises preceded by a prepulse, {{and were asked to}} rate the intensity of the second noise relative to the first. Inhibition of blink amplitude was greater for a 110 dB(A) noise than for a 95 dB(A) noise with a 120 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval, whereas there was no difference with a 30 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval. The reduction in perceived intensity was greater for the 110 dB(A) noise than for the 95 dB(A) noise with the 120 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval, but not with the 30 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval. The parallel results support an association between prepulse inhibition and perceived intensity. However, the prepulse did not reduce intensity ratings relative to control trials in some conditions, suggesting that prepulse inhibition is not always associated with an attenuation {{of the impact of the}} blink-eliciting stimulus...|$|R

50|$|Upon reading Galileo's {{theory in}} his Discorsi, Berti {{and another man}} named Raffaele Magiotti devised an {{experiment}} to test {{the existence of a}} vacuum. Some time between 1640 and 1643, Berti built an 11 <b>m</b> <b>lead</b> tube, filled it with water, and sealed both ends. He submerged one end in water and unsealed it. Though some of the water flowed out, much of it remained, filling about 10 m (34 feet) of the tube, the same height of Baliani's syphon. Berti claimed that the space above was filled with a vacuum. His claim was strongly contested, and multiple experiments were performed attempting to disprove the existence of a vacuum. This experiment led to Evangelista Torricelli's research into the weight of air and his invention of the barometer.|$|E
50|$|An ear {{infection}} to Bill Longworth resulted in Champion being {{promoted to the}} 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team. In the final on 15 July, Champion swam the second leg, and started equal with the American swimmer after Cecil Healy's first leg before building up a 10 <b>m</b> <b>lead</b> in his leg. Les Boardman extended the lead to 15 m before Harold Hardwick held off Duke Kahanamoku to claim {{the gold medal in}} the world record time of 10:11.6. The final was the third time that a world record had been set in that event at the Stockholm games, the first two times occurring on 12 July with the United States team swimming 10:26.4, only to be bettered later that day by the Australasian team who swam 10:14.0 (the United States team won the silver medal in the final).|$|E
50|$|Bjorklund {{competed in}} his second Pan American Games in 1975. In the 10,000 m run, he {{finished}} just outside the medal places, in fourth. In June 1976, Bjorklund ran in the 10,000 m race at the U.S. Olympic Trials, seeking {{a place at the}} 1976 Summer Olympics. The race was held at Eugene, Oregon's Hayward Field over almost 25 laps; the top three finishers would earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. In {{the first half of the}} race, the leading contenders—Bjorklund, Craig Virgin, Bill Rodgers, and Frank Shorter—stayed grouped together. During lap 14, Bjorklund lost his left shoe when another runner made contact with his foot. Despite only wearing one shoe, Bjorklund continued running, but with two laps remaining Rodgers had built a 30 <b>m</b> <b>lead</b> on him. While Shorter and Virgin battled for the win, Bjorklund made up his deficit to Rodgers and overtook him, beating him to the finish line by less than a second. At the Olympics, Bjorklund reached the 10,000 m final, becoming the lone U.S. qualifier for the event. He did not win a medal in the final, ending in 13th place.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{his success}} during the year, Gabe was only {{considered}} a mild threat {{to make the}} United States Olympic team in the 1500 m. The prohibitive favorites at the Trials were previous Olympians like Paul McMullen and Steve Holman. Gabe and his teammate, Michael Stember, made some noise by finishing 1-2 in their qualifying heat to make the finals. After jostling around with the pack {{for the first two}} laps of the final, Gabe made a big move and shot out to almost a 30 <b>m</b> <b>lead.</b> He kept chugging and crossed the line first in a new personal best of 3:35.90 to qualify for the Olympic team. Stember was no better than sixth with 100 m to go, but held his form and finished third in a personal best of 3:37.04. While Gabe's time qualified him for the Olympics, Stember's did not, so he had to chase the time all summer, finally achieving it in his final attempt. At the Olympics, Gabe finished sixth in his preliminary heat to advance to the semifinals. But his Olympic dream would end in the semis when he got outkicked for a spot in the finals.|$|E
50|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200 m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed {{his hand in the}} semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1 min 45.35 s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02 s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100 m mark just 0.04 s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150 m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1 min 45.83 s, {{the first time that he}} had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10 <b>m</b> <b>lead</b> over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7 min 07.05 s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E

40|$|We {{used the}} startle eyeblink {{modification}} paradigm {{to investigate whether}} clinically anxious children, like high trait-anxious adults, display a bias in favour of threat words compared to neutral words. The present study included 16 clinically anxious children whose diagnostic status was determined using the parent version of a semistructured diagnostic interview {{as part of a}} larger childhood anxiety study. The children were presented with threat and neutral words for 6 s each. A startle-eliciting auditory stimulus - a 100 dBA burst of white noise of 50 ms duration - was presented during the words at lead intervals of 60, 120, 240, or 3500 ms and during intertrial intervals. The overall pattern of startle eyeblink modification indicated inhibition at the 120 and 240 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> intervals and facilitation at the 3500 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval. Startle-latency shortening during threat words at the 60 <b>ms</b> <b>lead</b> interval was larger than at other intervals, whereas there was no difference during neutral words.
