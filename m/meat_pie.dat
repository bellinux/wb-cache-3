5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

50|$|Middle Eastern <b>meat</b> <b>pies</b> {{are called}} sfiha and contain ground beef, olive oil, plain yogurt, tahini, allspice, onion, {{tomatoes}} and pine nuts. Greek <b>meat</b> <b>pies</b> are called kreatopita and contain ground beef, onions and feta cheese. The filling for kreatopita is wrapped in phyllo dough.

25|$|The Lebanese {{national}} {{dishes are}} the kibbe, a <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul. The national beverage is arak, a strong anise-flavored liquor made from fermented grape juice. It is usually drunk {{with water and}} ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.|$|E
500|$|Impressions of Northern English cuisine {{are still}} {{shaped by the}} working-class diet of the early twentieth century, which was heavy on offal, high in {{calories}} and often not particularly healthy. Dishes such as black pudding, tripe, mushy peas and <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> remain stereotypical Northern English foods in the national imagination. As a result, there is a concerted effort among Northern chefs to improve the region's image. Some Northern dishes, such as Yorkshire pudding and Lancashire hotpot have spread across the UK, and only their names now hint at their origin. Among the Northern delicacies that have achieved Protected Geographical Status are traditional Cumberland sausage, traditional Grimsby smoked fish, Swaledale cheese, Yorkshire forced rhubarb and Yorkshire Wensleydale.|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Benjamin Barker, a barber, {{arrives in}} London, {{accompanied}} by sailor Anthony Hope.

2500|$|Breaded {{and fried}} meats — milanesas — {{are used as}} snacks, in sandwiches, or eaten warm with mashed {{potatoes}} — purée.

A variation, the [...] "empanada gallega" [...] (Galician empanada), is a big, round <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> made most commonly with tuna and mackerel ("caballa" [...] in Spanish). Vegetables and salads are also eaten by Argentines; tomatoes, onions, lettuce, eggplants, squashes, and zucchini are common side dishes.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Meat</b> <b>pie</b> Western (also Kangaroo Western)(a slang term {{which plays}} on the Italo-western moniker [...] "Spaghetti Western") is an American Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, {{especially}} the Australian Outback or the Australian Bush. Films such as Rangle River (1936), Kangaroo (1952), Mad Dog Morgan (1976), The Man from Snowy River (1982), and Five Mile Creek (1983–85), Quigley Down Under (1991), The Proposition (2005) are all representative of the genre. The term is used to differentiate more Americanized Australian films from those with a more historical basis, such as those about bushrangers.|$|E

2500|$|Early British {{settlers}} brought familiar {{meats and}} crops with them from Europe and these remain {{important in the}} Australian diet. The British settlers found some familiar game – such as swan, goose, pigeon, and fish – but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. They established agricultural industries producing more familiar Western style produce. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia's main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming {{is found in the}} southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia. [...] "Meat and three veg", fish and chips, and the Australian <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> continue to represent traditional meals for many Australians. The post-World War II multicultural immigration program brought new flavours and influences, with waves of immigrants from Greece, Italy, Vietnam, China, and elsewhere bringing about diversification of the typical diet consumed.|$|E

50|$|In April 2002, the Australian Consumers Association {{conducted}} a study of 22 frozen <b>meat</b> <b>pies</b> available in supermarkets. They found three brands {{did not meet the}} minimum 25 per cent meat content requirement set by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), and that the fat content ranged from 15 to 35 grams of fat per pie. The ACA study was of a select group of frozen <b>meat</b> <b>pies</b> in supermarkets, thus the study does not account for freshly baked <b>meat</b> <b>pies</b> of which the meat content and nutritional value varies from bakery to bakery. Another study by ACA in 2006 found 5 of the 23 pie products tested had less than the minimum 25% meat required.|$|R

60|$|Horrod laid {{in front}} of me a cold <b>meat</b> <b>pie,</b> a cold goose, a cheese, and a tall flagon of cider. But my {{appetite}} was gone. I ate the goose, but found that after I had finished the pie I had but little zest for the cheese, which I finished without enjoyment. The cider had a sour taste, and after having permitted Horrod to refill the flagon twice I found that it induced a sense of melancholy and decided to drink no more.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Quinion then {{formally}} {{engaged me}} to be as useful as I could in the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby, at a salary, I think, of six shillings a week. I am not clear whether it was six or seven. I am inclined to believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that it was six at first and seven afterwards. He paid me a week down (from his own pocket, I believe), and I gave Mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to Windsor Terrace that night: it being too heavy for my strength, small as it was. I paid sixpence more for my dinner, which was a <b>meat</b> <b>pie</b> and a turn at a neighbouring pump; and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal, in walking about the streets.|$|E
60|$|Our {{excellent}} youth had {{imported from}} the city a <b>meat</b> <b>pie,</b> and I was glad to find it flanked with a decanter of really admirable wine of Oporto.

Opinion in town was very favourable to us: our courage was applauded, and many professed regret that our ultimate chance of escape should be so small. The man who had fallen was one Sombref, a peasant; he was one who slept in {{a different part of the}} Castle; and I was thus assured that the whole of my former companions had attained their liberty, and Shed A was untenanted.|$|E
