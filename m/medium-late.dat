40|$|The risk {{associated}} {{to the production}} of biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) to feed a power plant in the Po Valley (Italy) was studied with a modelling approach. Available biomass was modelled by CropSyst, coupled to a “sorghum haying model”, using three sorghum genotypes, of contrasting earliness (early, <b>medium-late</b> and late), on a mosaic of virtual farms created in the target cropping area. The energy performance, from cradle to farm gate, of the biomass production system was performed calculating Energy Return on Investment (EROI), Net Energy Gain (NEG) and Energy Use Efficiency (EUE). The highest baled biomass (14. 0 Mg DM ha− 1 y− 1) was obtained with the early maturity type that had less haymaking failures (6. 9 %), followed by the late and <b>medium-late</b> genotypes. As a consequence, the early maturity type had the highest probability of exceeding the biomass needs of the power plant on a cropping area of 4222 ha. The early genotype also had the highest EROI (14. 8) and NEG (205. 6 GJ ha− 1 y− 1) and the lowest EUE (1. 06 GJ Mg− 1 DM y− 1). To achieve a 0. 5 probability to exceed the target biomass production, the area to be cultivated should be 4558, 5160 and 4962 ha for the early, <b>medium-late</b> and late genotypes, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{maturity}} is {{a complex}} physiological trait routinely evaluated by plant breeders because of its agronomic, economic, and breeding implications. In potato, plant maturity is typically estimated by monitoring vine characteristics. This study investigates several reported measures of vine maturity in potato cultivars, including examination of flower development, leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf peroxidase activity to see what method is most appropriate for maturity classification in temperate production regions. These three measures were evaluated multiple times throughout a single growing season across two locations. The {{data were analyzed using}} canonical discriminant and dichotomous tree analyses. Both methods revealed that flower development is not an accurate indicator of maturity, even though it is a common component of maturity screening protocols. Peroxidase measures were slightly better, but the optimal period of time to assess this trait was variable across locations and a considerable time commitment is required to collect and process samples. Monitoring leaf chlorophyll content throughout plant development was most appropriate for predicting vine maturity under these conditions, as this trait showed the most consistency and greatest prediction accuracy (69 % - 71 %) relative to peroxidase activity and flowering development. Additionally, chlorophyll measurements are a more practical method of measuring maturity due to the ease of data collection. Leaf chlorophyll content best distinguished late cultivars from early-medium and <b>medium-late</b> cultivars. However, it did not separate early-medium from <b>medium-late</b> cultivars. Combining chlorophyll monitoring with peroxidase and flowering measures improved the ability to distinguish among the early-medium and <b>medium-late</b> maturity classes.

40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} the {{important}} environmental parameters that determines the development of a crop from one stage to another. It is integral in the calculation of heat units. In this study, the thermal index concept is used to determine the length of the growing period of short season, medium season, and <b>medium-late</b> season maize crop varieties for different sowing dates (1 st dekad of October to 1 st dekad of January). The results show high spatiotemporal variation in the median growing period for all three maize varieties. The length of the growing period for the short, medium, and <b>medium-late</b> season varieties is relatively short during October to early December with values in some areas of less than 100, 120, and 120 days, respectively. The duration of the planting period increases exponentially in most places starting from the 2 nd dekad of November to 2 nd dekad of December, depending on the region and crop variety. Long growing periods are likely to align maize growing period with dates of high frost risk and water shortages.

Field screening were performance under artificial inoculation and natural conditions. Early blight response was evaluated based on lesion size, disease severity, and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). One clone displayed reduced lesion area (0. 35 cm 2) and AUDPC values compared to cv. `Desirée' (susceptible control) (0. 58 cm 2) but those values {{were higher than}} that of the resistant control Solanum chacoense `PI 275136 ' (0. 14 cm 2). On the other hand, no differences in lesion number were detected between the susceptible control and the selected clones. This variable showed values between 21. 82 and 23. 87 lesions in two leaves per plant. Although early blight resistance in potato is generally associated to late maturity, the mutant IBP- 27 displayed increased resistance to early blight with <b>medium-late</b> maturity. The six clones presented medium-early to <b>medium-late</b> maturity, similar to parental cv. `Desirée' (vegetative cycle ranging from 90 to 110 days).

40|$|An {{objective}} {{evaluation of}} maize hybrids in intensive cropping systems requires identification {{not only of}} yield components and other agronomically important traits but also of stability parameters. Grain yield and its components were assessed in 11 maize hybrids with different lengths of growing season (FAO 300 - 700 maturity groups) using analysis of variance and regression analysis at three different locations in Western Serbia. The test hybrids and locations showed significant differences in grain yield, grain moisture content at maturity, 1, 000 -kernel weight and ear length. A significant interaction was observed between all traits and the environment. The hybrids with higher mean values of the traits, regardless of maturity group, generally exhibited sensitivity i. e. adaptation to more favourable environmental conditions as compared to those having lower mean values. Regression coefficient (bi) values for grain yield mostly suggested no significant differences relative to the mean. The medium-season hybrid gave high yields and less favourable values of stability parameters at most locations and in most years, as compared to mediumlate hybrids. As compared to medium-early hybrids, <b>medium-late</b> hybrids (FAO 600 and 700) mostly exhibited unfavourable values of stability parameters i. e. a specific response and better adaptation to favourable environmental conditions, and gave higher average yields. Apart from producing lower average yields, FAO 300 and 400 hybrids showed higher yield stability {{as compared to the}} other hybrids tested. <b>Medium-late</b> hybrids had higher yields and showed a better response to favourable environmental conditions compared to early-maturing hybrids.

The results obtained with cultured cells indicate that retinoids function as inducers of {{the appearance of}} UCP and, at the same time, partially inhibit brown adipocyte cell proliferation. The two RA isomers displayed similar effectiveness as UCP inducers, their effect being comparable with that triggered by noradrenaline, so far {{considered to be the}} main modulator of UCP gene expression. The effectiveness of retinoids as UCP inducers was dependent on the stage of brown adipocyte differentiation, being maximal in confluent primary cells and in the <b>medium-late</b> differentiation stage of HIB 1 B cells.

40|$|The {{reform of}} the European sugar market in 2006 {{paved the way for}} the {{development}} of new agricultural value chains in the Po Valley (Italy). A value chain based on the use of biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) to produce electricity in a medium-scale power plant was investigated. A Life Cycle Assessment was carried out to explore the environmental impact and energy performance of power generation from three biomass sorghum genotypes characterized by different earliness (early, <b>medium-late</b> and late) in the Po Valley (Italy). To fully cover the plant needs, sorghum was complemented by winter wheat straw. Productivity and losses of sorghum for the past 39 years as simulated in Serra et al. (2017) were used to produce a probability distribution of environmental impacts. Soil organic carbon change relative to the straw removal and sorghum incorporation in soil as well as indirect land use change CO 2 emissions for the substitution of sugar crops with energy crops were also accounted for. To test the influence of the assumptions an extensive sensitivity analysis over several parameters was performed. The lowest average GHG emissions (68. 9 g CO 2 eq. /MJ) were achieved with the late genotype while <b>medium-late</b> and early genotypes emitted 73. 5 g CO 2 eq. /MJ and 76. 8 g CO 2 eq. /MJ, respectively. Despite the conservative assumptions, the bioenergy system contributed on average 47. 7 % less GHG than a natural gas power plant. In the lowest productivity years the sorghum based energy system emitted 52 % less GHG than the Italian electricity mix. Overall, when harvesting and bailing failed due to unfavourable weather conditions, the lowest GHG emissions were found, thanks to the increased replacement of sorghum with straw. In fact, soil incorporation of sorghum biomass resulted in more nutrients added to the soil than with incorporation of wheat straw. Considering that GHG emissions decreased linearly when sorghum biomass yield increased, the highest reductions of GHG were found with late genotypes, that produced the highest yields. The lowest GHG emissions were found when harvesting failed, as the fertilizer debit of straw is lower than the fertilizer credit of sorghum. However, since carbon and nutrients storage in the soil is not rewarded monetarily, this option will not correspond to an optimal profit as the risk of failures are highest with late genotype. All other environmental impacts assessed were higher for the sorghum based system than for the fossil alternatives. It was found that the presence of DeNOx SNCR (Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction) technology achieved the expected mitigation of acidification potential and photochemical oxidant formation but at the expenses of an increased climate change impact, due to additional N 2 O emissions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the expression of Akt and PKCa in chondrocytes of human knee osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, further evaluating their role in chondrocyte apoptosis during OA progression. Human knee OA cartilages were obtained from 38 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, which is the <b>medium-late</b> stage of OA. Healthy knee cartilages were obtained from 11 amputees. The samples taken from the condyle of femur were collected routinely for morphological, immunohistochemical and Western blot detection, respectively. Light microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy were used for morphological observation. The optical density with computer image analysis evaluated the intensity of immunohistochemical reaction of Akt and PKCα in OA cartilage. Western blot detected the protein expression levels. The results indicated that Akt and PKCa were involved in OA progression, along with the increase of cell apoptosis. In OA cartilage, Akt decreased (p &lt; 0. 05) and PKCα increased (p &lt; 0. 05). There was a negative correlation and interaction between Akt and PKCα (r = – 0. 8).

The increasing value of bulbs, also due to a renewed cultural interest toward traditional foods and their benefits for health, claims to enhance the agricultural production. Surprisingly, no agronomic studies about the best practice of propagation exist. We tested whether and how germination rate and weight and size of bulbs, after one growing season, were affected by sowing date (autumn–spring), growing condition (greenhouse, shaded greenhouse and open field), and container’s volume. Results showed that the best-sowing period ranges between September and January; following this period there is a huge decrease in germination rate. The time of seedling emergence was higher in open field than in protected environment. The longer interval of growing was observed with the sowing of October that produced heavier and larger bulbs. The best combination to obtain larger bulbs is sowing in October under greenhouse. However, under shaded conditions it was possible to obtain satisfactory results even with <b>medium-late</b> sowing (December and January). Containers with higher volume generally performed better. We conclude that mass propagation of M. comosum could be efficiently performed for agronomic purposes using nurseries.

In the three-year period average, the highest total yield was recorded in Zemun (35. 80 t ha־¹), followed by Guča (29. 32 t ha־¹), while the lowest average yield recorded was in Srbobran (27. 38 t ha־¹). The highest average yield of tubers in the three-year period was recorded in the Cleopatra variety, followed by Adora variety, while the lowest average yield was recorded in the variety Frisia. Obtained {{results show that the}} highest yields over observed locations were recorded in early varieties that formed medium number of tubers per plant (Cleopatra and Adora) and medium late varieties (Desiree and Kondor) that expressed good resistance to high air temperatures and stress caused by drought...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the expression of Akt and PKC alpha in chondrocytes of human knee osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, further evaluating their role in chondrocyte apoptosis during OA progression. Human knee OA cartilages were obtained from 38 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, which is the <b>medium-late</b> stage of OA. Healthy knee cartilages were obtained from 11 amputees. The samples taken from the condyle of femur were collected routinely for morphological, immunohistochemical and Western blot detection, respectively. Light microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy were used for morphological observation. The optical density with computer image analysis evaluated the intensity of immunohistochemical reaction of Akt and PKC alpha in OA cartilage. Western blot detected the protein expression levels. The results indicated that Akt and PKC alpha were involved in OA progression, along with the increase of cell apoptosis. In OA cartilage, Akt decreased (p < 0. 05) and PKC alpha increased (p < 0. 05). There was a negative correlation and interaction between Akt and PKC alpha (r = - 0. 8). These results demonstrated that both Akt and PKC alpha are related to increased chondrocyte apoptosis in human OA cartilage. The correlation between human OA progression, the role of Akt and PKC alpha, and chondrocyte apoptosis allows for new therapeutic strategies to be considered.

40|$|Background International HIV {{guidelines}} {{have recently}} shifted from a <b>medium-late</b> to an early-start treatment strategy. As a consequence, {{more people will}} be eligible to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). We estimate mean life years gained using different treatment indications in low income countries. Methods We carried out a systematic search to identify relevant studies on the treatment effect of HAART. Outcome from identified observational studies were combined in a pooled-analyses and we apply these data in a Markov life cycle model based on a hypothetical Tanzanian HIV population. Survival for three different HIV populations with and without any treatment is estimated. The number of patients included in our pooled-analysis is 35 047. Results Providing HAART early when CD 4 is 200 - 350 cells/μl {{is likely to be}} the best outcome strategy with an expected net benefit of 14. 5 life years per patient. The model predicts diminishing treatment benefits for patients starting treatment when CD 4 counts are lower. Patients starting treatment at CD 4 50 - 199 and < 50 cells/μl have expected net health benefits of 7. 6 and 7. 3 life years. Without treatment, HIV patients with CD 4 counts 200 - 350; 50 - 199 and < 50 cells/μl can expect to live 4. 8; 2. 0 and 0. 7 life years respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrates that HIV patients live longer with early start strategies in low income countries. Since low income countries have many constraints to full coverage of HAART, this study provides input to a more transparent debate regarding where to draw explicit eligibility criteria during further scale up of HAART...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid maize is {{produced}} using inbred lines that originate from genetically different (divergent) sources (heterotic groups). Inbred lines {{from at least}} two different sources that produce heterotic F 1 progeny make up a heterotic pair. Thus far, {{a large number of}} heterotic pairs differing in their heterotic potential for grain yield and other traits have been identified. The BSSS × Lancaster heterotic pair is often used in the temperate zone to develop <b>medium-late</b> to late maize hybrids beloning to FAO maturity groups 500 to 700. The lines B 73, Mo 17 and derived lines are typical representatives of the BSSS × Lancaster heterotic pair. In order to determine the contribution of breeding to the increase of grain yield in B 73 × Mo 17 hybrids, lines had been introduced from America (the original versions of B 73 and Mo 17) or developed at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad between 1980 and 2000 and represent three different cycles of selection. B 73 - and Mo 17 -type inbreds were used to study the combining abilities for grain yield of the lines and hybrids and assess the contributions of the selection cycles to grain yield increases in the lines and hybrids. With both types of germplasm, s the lines from the third cycle of selection had the highest grain yields. Based on the coefficient of linear regression, the increase of yield in the hybrids from the third selection cycle compared with the first cycle was found to be over 124 kg cycle with B 73, and 677 kg cycle with Mo 17 inbreds...|$|E

Experimental field {{is located in the}} maize production area (climatic region: warm; climatic sub region dry; climatic zone: warm, dry with mild winter and long sunshine) in altitude 250 [*]m above sea level, with brown soil. We observed the influence of both temperature and moisture conditions of experimental area on sunflower yield of achenes (conventional, <b>medium-late</b> hybrids: NK Brio, NK Armoni). Preceding crop of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) every experimental year was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Technological system of sunflower cultivation was realized in accordance with conventional technology of cultivation. The basic fertilization was made by balance method on the base of agrochemical soil analysis for expected yield 3 t. ha− 1. The meteorological data were got out from agrometeorological station of the Central Controlling and Testing Institute in Agriculture in Veľké Ripňany. During every experimental year the change of inner energy (ΔU) was evaluated for thermodynamic characteristic analysis (security of the temperature and moisture) and the impact of changes on yield forming with maximal yield (Ymax in 2008) and minimal yield (Ymin in 2009). Achieved value of yield from thermal and precipitation energy introduces concrete energy amount, which is available in given period for concrete height of yield. From the results follow, the sunflower has got critical thermodynamic phase in the period of months from July to August. For the yield formation is requirement, that input power of precipitation prevailed over the thermal during moths July to August. Achieved results confirmed statistically high significant dependence of the yield on weather conditions and for high annual variations in climatic characteristics the consideration is needed about potential changes some agrotechnological measures of technological system of sunflower cultivation...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study [Confalonieri and Bocchi, 2005], the generic crop simulator CropSyst was parameterized and evaluated against biomass data collected on Japonica (early- and <b>medium-late</b> maturity) and Indica rice varieties but, upon further investigation, inconsistencies in the simulation of leaf area index emerged for the latter. The need for a re-parameterization of the model became apparent after carefully studying new field data made available in the meantime. In particular, some relevant parameters such as specific leaf area, stem-leaf partition, extinction coefficient and light-to-biomass conversion efficiency, are now available from reliable field measurements (respectively 27 m 2 kg- 1, 3. 6 m 2 kg- 1, 0. 59 and 3. 2 g MJ- 1) and differ considerably from those previously obtained via calibration (39 m 2 kg- 1, 1. 5 m 2 kg- 1, 0. 50 and 3. 0 g MJ- 1). In general, the agreement between simulated and observed values of crop biomass {{was pretty much the}} same with both parameters sets (average values of GSD [general standard deviation, also called relative root mean square error] were, respectively, 25 % and 26 % for old and new parameterization; corresponding values of EF [modelling efficiency] were 0. 90 and 0. 87; FAI, a fuzzy-based indicator given by the aggregation of GSD and EF assumed values of 0. 09 and 0. 17, 0 being the best value and 1 being the worst). Such simple comparisons figure out as the accumulation of mass and leaf area in crop models can be depicted in different ways and reasonable estimations of overall growth can be achieved by different pathways, not all of which being logically acceptable. A check on model parameters like the one performed here is worth to give some protection against spurious conclusions and indicate whether the model parameterization is conceptually consistent and related to reality.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{resistance}} in commercial hybrids for Fusarium ear rot {{is still not}} in general adequate to prevent un-acceptable toxin concentrations in field. The purpose of this experiment was to verify the behaviour of commercial dent maize hybrids for fumonisin and zearalenone contamination and to identify the variety traits that influence the production of these toxins. Field experiments were carried out in 2000, 2001 and 2002 to evaluate the effect of maize hybrid maturity and en-dosperm hardness on European Corn Borer (ECB) incidence, fungal ear rot incidence and severity and on fu-monisin B 1 and zearalenone contents. Nineteen yellow soft commercial hybrids, from the 500, 600 and 700 FAO ma-turity groups, were compared in 4 sites in NW Italy. Hybrid were grouped in 3 endosperm hardness categories (hard, intermediate, soft) in function of Hard/Soft (H/S) endosperm ratio. No effect due to endosperm hardness or hybrid maturity on the ECB infestation or fungal ear rot incidence and severity was observed. Grain hardness significant influenced fumonisin B 1 content: hard endosperm hybrids showed 50 % lower contami-nation than soft hybrids. The presence of fumonisin B 1 in the grain of different maturity hybrids only resulted to be significantly different in 2001 experiment, with a mean concentration 2 times higher in the later hybrids (FAO rating 700) compared to the medium and <b>medium-late</b> hybrids. The zearalenone content never resulted to be significantly different in function of the endosperm hardness, while, late maturing hybrids, in which grain moisture content decreases slowly below 30 %, {{are more susceptible to}} zear-alenone contamination. This research has highlighted the presence of variety traits that can influence mycotoxin contamination. An accu-rate choice of hybrid, considering the territorial and cultivation context, could contribute to achieve products, that contain mycotoxins, which do not exceed the maximum international and UE regulation levels.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyKraig L. RoozeboomPrevious {{research}} {{has revealed that}} winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields are often reduced following grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] compared to wheat after other summer crops. The objectives {{of the study were}} to: (a) evaluate grain sorghum residue management strategies to improve the performance of a following winter wheat crop in no-till systems; (b) determine grain sorghum hybrid characteristics that facilitate planting wheat following grain sorghum, and identify winter wheat cultivars that are suitable for planting after grain sorghum; (c) evaluate effect of environment, sampling time, and grain sorghum hybrid plant pigmentation on phenolic acid concentration in sorghum residues. Experiments were conducted in environments suitable for planting winter wheat following a summer crop. Treatments for objective one were: glyphosate (pre-harvest application, post-harvest, none), residue (removed, chopped, left standing), and nitrogen (34 kg ha⁻¹ applied to residue, none). Treatments for objective two and three were grain sorghum hybrids representing three maturities (early, medium, <b>medium-late)</b> and two plant pigmentations (red, tan), wheat cultivars occupying significant planted acreage and having favorable performance within the region. Wheat yields increased in two environments by 217 and 630 kg ha⁻¹ when glyphosate was applied to the sorghum pre-harvest. Residue chopping or removal either had no effect or a negative effect on wheat yields compared to residue left standing. Nitrogen applied to the sorghum residue increased wheat yields in only one environment. Grain sorghum hybrid characteristics did not influence winter wheat yields in any environment, but winter wheat cultivar did influence grain yields of the winter wheat in three of the four environments. Breakdown of phenolic acids depended on environment. Results for these studies indicate that wheat yield after a grain sorghum crop can be maximized by planting a red-pigmented sorghum hybrid of an early or medium maturity, desiccating the sorghum crop with pre-harvest glyphosate if it {{can be applied to the}} sorghum roughly 45 to 50 days before a frost, and with a wheat cultivar that is well suited to no-till planting...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a three-year exact plot experiment (2008 - 2010) established in Bałcyny (NE Poland). Three potato cultivars were grown: medium-early ‘Adam’, <b>medium-late</b> ‘Pasja Pomorska’, and late ‘Ślęza’. The experimental factors were foliar fertilizers applied alone or in combination (Basfoliar 12 - 4 - 6, ADOB Mn, Solubor DF) and two levels of soil mineral fertilization (N 1 P 1 K 1 - 80 kg N × ha - 1, 80 kg P × ha - 1, 120 K × ha - 1; N 2 P 2 K 2 - 120 kg N × ha - 1, 144 kg P × ha - 1, 156 K × ha - 1). The experimental materials comprised potato tubers. The symptoms of soft rot (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum), late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and dry rot (Fusarium spp.) were evaluated in 5 kg potato samples, and were expressed as the percentage mass of infected tubers. The rates of common scab (Streptomyces scabies) and black scurf (Rhizoctonia solani) infection were estimated on 100 tubers collected randomly after harvest, according to a nine-point scale, and were presented as a percentage infection index. In the laboratory, fungi were isolated on PDA medium from potato tubers immediately after harvest and after five-month storage. The incidence of tuber diseases depended on potato cultivars affected. The severity of tuber diseases varied between treatments with two levels of NPK fertilization and foliar fertilization. The lowest number of Fusarium- infected tubers was obtained from treatments where three foliar fertilizers were applied in combination, which was confirmed by the lowest abundance of fungal isolates. More fungi were isolated from potato tubers after harvest than after storage, but pathogens were more frequently isolated from stored tubers. After harvest, the lowest number of pathogenic fungi was isolated from the tubers of cv. ‘Adam’ in the non-fertilized treatment, and after storage – from the tubers of the late cultivars in the treatment with three foliar fertilizers applied in combination...|$|E
