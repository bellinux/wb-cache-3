50|$|Slopping {{out is the}} <b>manual</b> <b>emptying</b> {{of human}} waste when prison cells are {{unlocked}} in the morning. Inmates without a flush toilet in the cell have to use other means (formerly a chamber pot, then a bucket, now often a chemical toilet) while locked in during the night. The reason that some cells do not have toilets is that they date from the Victorian era and were therefore not designed with plumbing. As a result, there is no space in which to put a toilet, together with the expense and difficulty of installing the necessary pipes.|$|E

50|$|The Omni Processor is {{targeted}} {{as a solution}} for developing countries, although challenges around technical and financial aspects remain. Omni Processors and Omni Ingestors are being designed to provide an alternative to sewerage system-based technologies. They are also intended to address {{the large number of}} existing pit latrines which lack a supporting infrastructure of fecal sludge collection and processing when the pits are full. Sludge from pit latrines has to be removed from the pits for treatment and disposal either by pumping (if the fecal sludge is sufficiently liquid) or by <b>manual</b> <b>emptying</b> with shovels or other devices (in India, this practice is called manual scavenging). Despite new low-cost pumps being developed, {{only a small fraction of}} sludge is safely extracted and treated currently in many African and Asian cities.|$|E
40|$|Background: Bowel {{problems}} such as constipation, diarrhoea and faecal incontinence (FI) are prevalent conditions among nursing home residents and {{little is known about}} nursing management. This study aimed to elucidate how Norwegian registered nurses (RNs) manage bowel problems among nursing home residents. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used combining quantitative data from a population-based cross-sectional survey and qualitative data from a focus group interview. In the cross sectional part of the study 27 of 28 nursing homes in one Norwegian municipality participated. Residents were included if they, at the time of data collection, had been a resident in a nursing home for more than three weeks or had prior stays of more than four weeks during the last six months. Residents were excluded from the study if they were younger than 65 years or had a stoma (N = 980 after exclusions). RNs filled in a questionnaire for residents regarding FI, constipation, diarrhoea, and treatments/ interventions. In the focus group interview, 8 RNs participated. The focus group interview used an interview guide that included six open-ended questions. Results: Pad use (88. 9 %) and fixed toilet schedules (38. 6 %) were the most commonly used interventions for residents with FI. In addition, the qualitative data showed that controlled emptying of the bowels with laxatives and/or enemas was common. Common interventions for residents with constipation were laxatives (66. 2 %) and enemas (47 %), dietary interventions (7. 3 %) and <b>manual</b> <b>emptying</b> of feces (6. 3 %). In addition, the qualitative data showed that the RNs also used fixed toilet schedules for residents with constipation. Interventions for residents with diarrhoea were Loperamide (18. 3 %) and dietary interventions (20. 1 %). RNs described bowel care management as challenging due to limited time and resources. Consequently, compromises were a part of their working strategies. Conclusions: Constipation was considered to be the main focus of bowel management. Emptying the residents’ bowels was the aim of nursing intervention. FI was mainly treated passively with pads and interventions for residents with diarrhoea were limited. The RNs prioritized routine tasks in the nursing homes due to limited resources, and thereby compromising with the resident’s need for individualized bowel care. © Saga et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2014.

40|$|An {{inventory}} {{has been}} made of manual lifting situations in the cultivation and forcing of flower bulbs and bulb flowers. Originally this was the first part of a study with two objectives: (1) reduction of physical load of workers in flower bulb cultivation, due to manual handling of crates, and (2) uniformization of crates in bulb cultivation and bulb forcing. Meanwhile, a new study on uniformization of these crates has started (AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿). Therefore the original study was stopped after the inventory and two new studies were started: `Information supply for reduction of physical load during handling of crates in bulb flower production¿ and `Fitting Arbo-expertise in the AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿¿. First, an overview {{has been made}} of the most important situations in bulb cultivation and bulb flower production where crates are lifted or moved. Then, ten bulb flower or flower bulb producers and three mechanization companies were interviewed. Information is collected at the production companies concerning the physical load, due to manual handling of the crates and concerning motives for or against mechanization. Based on the collected data Lifting Indices (a standard for physical load because of lifting) were calculated. In all visited companies several types of crates were used. In eight companies at least one type of palletboxes was used. Beside these, most companies use several 60 x 40 cm and 50 x 75 cm crates. Most companies use several types of these crates with different heights. It is concluded that in bulb cultivation most crate handling situations are mechanized, since generally very heavy (1 x 1. 2 x 1 m) palletboxes are used. Particularly in small companies and in some minor crops manual lifting occurs. In these cases, health standards are always exceeded. However, it must be noticed that this work occurs only during a limited part of the year. In bulb flower production more manual lifting occurs, especially when flowers are produced in pot soil. During planting, lifting indices (LI) between 2. 8 and 3. 3 (about three times the permitted weight) were found. Moving crates in and out the greenhouse is often mechanized, but during manual moving the LI was between 4. 5 and 6. 5. During <b>manual</b> <b>emptying</b> of crates, filled with soil, LI was between 4. 4 and 6. 7. When flowers are forced in water, the weights are much lower and LI was between 1 and 2. According to the visited mechanization companies it is almost always possible to adapt stackers and de-stackers so that they can handle several types of crates. This applies to other processes as well, such as emptying, filling and cleaning the crates. The most important bottleneck for mechanization is a financial one, since mechanization not always results in labour saving sufficient to cover the investment costs...|$|E

The journal's website is at: www. sustainabilityjournal. com and the definitive version of the paper is available at: [URL] sanitation is vital in many low-income country urban areas. Pit emptying is critical to its sustainability and small-scale manual emptiers {{play a key role in}} this. This paper investigates the sustainability of <b>manual</b> pit <b>emptying</b> as a livelihood option, focusing on the key sustainable livelihood factors relating to the human, social, physical and financial capitals of manual emptiers. These relate to: their role as emptiers; the employment systems and equipment; their health, well-being, social status and the acceptability of the job they do. The paper concludes that the current state of pit-emptying practice does not represent a sustainable long-term livelihood option for manual pit emptiers, as long as it continues with no improvements in technology, insufficient financial incentives and inadequate health and safety measures. Recommendations to improve sustainability include: improvements in emptying technology; provision of subsidies and free medical care; and health and safety education...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{tests to}} assist {{it in the}} diagnoses of rota- tor cuff {{impairment}} have been described in the literature but controversy still exists as {{to the accuracy of}} these tests. A study was therefore conducted to determine the reliability of the rotator cuff muscle tests (empty can, full can, lift off and external rotation) as a diagnostic tool. Methodology: Fifty three patients experiencing shoulder pain were assessedusing <b>manual</b> muscle tests (<b>empty</b> can; full can; lift off and external rotationtests). Both pain and weakness were recorded using numerical scales adapted from tests performed by Itoi et al, (1999). These results were compared to ultrasonic diagnoses made by a surgeon. Informed consent was obtained and anonymity was ensured for all participants. Results: A test was false positive when ultrasonic diagnosis indicated no tear in the muscle (although oedema or calcification may have been present), but the manual muscle test was positive regarding pain and weakness. A test on the other hand was false negative when the ultrasonic diagnosis indicated a muscle tear but the manual muscle tests indicated no pain or muscle weakness. Reliability was tested using sensitivity and specificity tests. The sensitivity of all four tests was high (80 %), but the specificity was low (20 % to 40 %), implying {{that a large number of}} false positive diagnoses can be made. The major contributors to the false positive results were sub-acromial sub-deltoid bursitis and a decreased acromio-humeral space. When considering pain alone for a positive result the correlation increased a  little, however, taking both pain and muscle weakness into account, the correlation increased even more. Conclusion: The manual muscle tests were not as reliable as expected, but concurrent pathologies may be the main factor influencing the results of the tests. The combination of muscle strength and pain could be recommended as criteria for a positive test. The empty can and full can tests could both be recommended in predicting a torn supraspinatus tendon, as they were equally sensitive</em...|$|R
5000|$|The shelter may cover very {{different}} sorts of toilets. A common {{one is the}} pit latrine or pit toilet, which collects human feces in {{a hole in the}} ground. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. [...] When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. The management of the fecal sludge removed from the pit is complicated. There are both environment and health risks if not done properly. As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people. This is mostly in the developing world as well as in rural and wilderness areas.Another system is the bucket toilet, consisting of a seat and a portable receptacle (bucket or pail).
