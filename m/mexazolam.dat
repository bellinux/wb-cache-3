5000|$|<b>Mexazolam</b> (marketed {{under the}} trade names Melex and Sedoxil) {{is a drug}} which is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. [...] <b>Mexazolam</b> has been trialed for anxiety and {{was found to be}} effective in alleviating anxiety at one week follow-up, however, after three weeks of therapy <b>mexazolam</b> had lost its therapeutic anxiolytic properties becoming no more effective than placebo, presumably due to benzodiazepine tolerance. <b>Mexazolam</b> is metabolised via the CYP3A4 pathway. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors including simvastatin, simvastatin acid, lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin inhibit the metabolism of <b>mexazolam,</b> but not the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin.|$|E
40|$|Repeated oral {{administration}} of <b>mexazolam,</b> an anti-anxiety agent, may cause adverse effects such as gastric disturbance, drowsiness, and ataxia due to transiently high blood levels. Transdermal administration would avoid the systemic {{side effects and}} gastric disorders after {{oral administration}}. We have developed a matrix using ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), a heat-processible and flexible material, for transdermal delivery of <b>mexazolam.</b> Drug solubility was highest at 40 % PEG- 400 volume fraction. The release and permeation profiles through the rat skin were determined for 24 h using a modified Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. The drug release was increased by increasing the concentration with a linear relationship between the release rate and the square root of loading dose. Increasing temperature increased drug release from the EVA matrix. The activation energy (Ea), which was measured from a slope of log P versus 1000 /T plot, was 8. 64 Kcal/mol for a 1. 5 % loading dose. To reduce the brittleness and increase the pore of the EVA matrix, diffrent plasticizers were used. Among the plasticizers, including the citrates or the phthalate groups, diethyl phthalate showed the highest effect on the release of <b>mexazolam.</b> To increase the skin permeation of <b>mexazolam</b> from the EVA matrix, enhancer...|$|E
40|$|Midazolam is a {{commonly}} used anaesthetic agent and is metabolised by the 3 A 4 isoform of the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system. Atorvastatin is also metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 and, in vitro, atorvastatin inhibits the cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 -mediated metabolism of <b>mexazolam.</b> We hypothesised that concurrent administration of atorvastatin and midazolam {{would result in}} altered midazolam pharmacokinetics. Fourteen patients scheduled to undergo general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited in a matched pair design to receive intravenous midazolam (0. 15 mg. kg- 1). Of these patients, seven were taking long-term atorvastatin. Atorvastatin patients demonstrated a greater area under the curve (889. 4 (standard deviation 388. 6) ng-h. ml- 1) vs. control patients (629. 1 (standard deviation 197. 2) ng-h. ml- 1) (p < 0. 05). Patients taking atorvastatin also demonstrated a decreased clearance (0. 18 (standard deviation 0. 08) l-kg. h- 1) vs. control patients (0. 27 (standard deviation 0. 08) l-kg. h- 1) (p < 0. 05). This study suggests that chronically administered atorvastatin decreases the clearance of intravenously administered midazolam...|$|E
40|$|Background Anxiety is a {{very common}} mental health problem in the general {{population}} and in the primary care setting. Herbal medicines are popularly used worldwide and could be an option for treating anxiety if shown to be effective and safe. Passiflora (passionflower extract) is one of these compounds. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness and safety of passiflora for treating any anxiety disorder. Search strategy the following sources were used: electronic databases: Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies), Medline and Lilacs; Cross-checking references; contact with authors of included studies and manufacturers of passiflora. Selection criteria Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of passiflora using any dose, regime, or method of administration for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status or any other mental health disorder in which anxiety is a core symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures such as Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and other scales for anxiety symptoms. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently selected the trials found through the search strategy, extracted data, performed the trial quality analyses and entered data. Where any disagreements occured, the third reviewer was consulted. Methodological quality of the trials included in this review was assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook. for dichotomous outcomes, relative risk with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and for continuous outcomes, weighted mean difference with 95 % CI was used. Main results Two studies, with a total of 198 participants, were eligible for inclusion in this review. Based on one study, a lack of difference in the efficacy of benzodiazepines and passiflora was indicated. Dropout rates were similar between the two interventions. Although the findings from one study suggested an improvement in job performance in favour of passiflora (post-hoc outcome) and one study showed a lower rate of drowsiness as a side effect with passiflora as compared with <b>mexazolam,</b> neither of these findings reached statistical significance. Authors' conclusions RCTs examining the effectiveness of passiflora for anxiety are too few in number to permit any conclusions to be drawn. RCTs with larger samples that compare the effectiveness of passiflora with placebo and other types of medication, including antidepressants, are needed.
