2500|$|Even then, Lavalle found, the nation’s {{electronic}} <b>mortgage</b> <b>registry</b> system, Mortgage Electronic Registration System, {{was playing}} {{fast and loose}} with the law — something that courts have belatedly recognized, too. Lavalle's efforts to get Fannie Mae to investigate its servicers' abuses and frauds began increased in 2003 with letters to the Fannie board of directors and their CEO, Franklin Raines. [...] After Fannie Mae was investigated for major accounting fraud and abuse after post-ENRON, the Fannie Mae board listened to Lavalle and caused in 2005 an independent counsel investigation to be undertaken by Baker Hostetler, a prestigious D.C. law firm.|$|E
40|$|This article reviews what we {{know about}} {{transferring}} ownership and the right of enforcement of nonnegotiable notes. The focus will be on notes secured by mortgages, since this is likely the context in which most modern nonnegotiable notes are created. There has been a vast amount of litigation about the transfer of negotiable mortgage notes in the past half decade, greatly expanding our understanding, but there has been little development involving nonnegotiable notes. Hence, it is helpful to compare negotiable and nonnegotiable notes, with particular emphasis on how each is transferred. Perhaps ironically, this means that the bulk of this article discusses negotiable notes as a point of reference, despite the fact that its ultimate focus is nonnegotiable notes. Part I of this article reviews the history of the definition of negotiability, and shows how our current understanding of negotiability came to be. Part II demonstrates how {{to tell the difference between}} negotiable and nonnegotiable notes, and why that difference is important. Part III discusses the meaning of “transfer” of a promissory note. Part IV examines specifically how the right to enforce nonnegotiable notes can be transferred under present law, and considers whether changes are needed. Finally, this article concludes with a brief description of a proposed national <b>mortgage</b> <b>registry</b> that has the potential to make transfers of both negotiable and nonnegotiable mortgage notes far more efficient without disrupting the current legal regime...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado a Iberometrics VIII: Eight Iberian Cliometrics Workshop. Organizado por el Institute of Advanced Research in Business and Economics (INARBE) de la Universidad Pública de Navarra, en colaboración con Glocred y expertos de instituciones de España y Portugal. Celebrado en la Upna el 20 - 21 de abril de 2017. This paper aims at {{providing}} {{quantitative and}} qualitative evidence of a crowding out effect due to war borrowing {{at the end of}} eighteenth-century Spain. In the second section, I examine the two key links in the crowding out argument. First, did the Spanish government's issuance of debt to finance warfare result in higher real interest rates? Second, did it cause a reduction of private investment? Annual data for long-term interest rates and for government borrowing allow examination of the first link in the crowding out argument. Then, using original annual data on the volume of long-term private credit that we collected from the <b>mortgage</b> <b>registry</b> of Madrid (Contaduría de Hipotecas de Madrid), we examine the second link of the argument. In the third section, this paper analyses structural changes in the long-term private capital market. We argue that the dramatic increase in public borrowing {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century to finance warfare crowded out ecclesiastical institutions and shut down large part of the private credit market for long-term annuities for the decades to come. We also show that the withdrawal of ecclesiastical institutions in the 1790 s came along with the rise of private obligations...|$|E
40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure crisis raises legal questions {{as important as}} its economic impact. Questions that were straightforward and uncontroversial a generation ago today threaten the stability of a 13 trillion mortgage market: Who has standing to foreclose? If a foreclosure was done improperly, what is the effect? And what is the proper legal method for transferring mortgages? These questions implicate the clarity of title for property nationwide and pose a too-big-to-fail problem for the courts. The legal confusion stems from the existence of competing systems for establishing title to mortgages and transferring those rights. Historically, mortgage title was established and transferred through the 2 ̆ 2 public demonstration 2 ̆ 2 regimes of UCC Article 3 and land recordation systems. This arrangement worked satisfactorily when mortgages were rarely transferred. Mortgage finance, however, shifted to securitization, which involves repeated bulk transfers of mortgages. To facilitate securitization, deal architects developed alternative 2 ̆ 2 contracting 2 ̆ 2 regimes for mortgage title: UCC Article 9 and MERS, a private <b>mortgage</b> <b>registry.</b> These new regimes reduced the cost of securitization by dispensing with demonstrative formalities, but {{at the expense of}} reduced clarity of title, which raised the costs of mortgage enforcement. This trade-off benefitted the securitization industry at the expense of securitization investors because it became apparent only subsequently with the rise in {{mortgage foreclosure}}s. The harm, however, has not been limited to securitization investors. Clouded mortgage title has significant negative externalities on the economy as a whole. This Article proposes reconciling the competing title systems through an integrated system of note registration and mortgage recordation, with compliance as a prerequisite to foreclosure. Such a system would resolve questions about standing, remove the potential cloud to real-estate title, and facilitate mortgage financing by clarifying property rights...|$|E
