25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of <b>my</b> <b>ability.</b> Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|When a CBC Radio {{interviewer}} {{suggested to}} Franklin that her ideas about {{peace and justice}} were not connected with what was actually happening {{in the aftermath of}} 9/11, she [...] readily agreed. [...] "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts." ...|$|E
500|$|Was it his ambitious poetry, {{which was}} written to win you, that stopped <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> to think? Did it cause all of my ideas to die {{as soon as they}} were born? Was it his heaven given ability, writing [...] which was blessed by the gods, that stopped me in my tracks? Neither he nor his companions who helped him were able to stop my poetic ability. Neither he nor the Muse which aids him each night can claim to have silenced me. For I am not afraid. However, when your beauty was gifted to him then I was lost and destroyed.|$|E

500|$|The Electoral College {{unanimously}} elected Washington as {{the first}} president in 1789 and again in 1792. He remains the only president to receive the totality of electoral votes. John Adams received the next highest vote total and was elected vice president. Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the first presidential oath of office {{on the balcony of}} Federal Hall in New York City. The oath was administered by Chancellor Robert R. Livingston: [...] "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States and will, to the best of <b>my</b> <b>ability,</b> preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."

500|$|One of {{the songs}} Carey {{recorded}} specifically for #1's was a cover of Brenda K. Starr's [...] "I Still Believe" [...] (1988) co-produced by Stevie J and Mike Mason. During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote {{that the purpose of}} the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> to write songs. Brenda K. Starr treated me like a 'star' and gave me a shot." [...] Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of [...] "Hero" [...] would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.|$|E
500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to the best of <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in <b>my</b> <b>ability,</b> and I always have. I know I can get the job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E

2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although I had {{one of my best}} years in 1905.

2500|$|The Hippocratic Oath makes {{explicit}} statements against {{deliberate harm}} {{not in the}} patient's best interests.

[...] (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|This mentality {{carries over}} into practice. Peer {{recognition}} {{goes to the}} most thorough and aggressive physicians. The prudent physician is not deemed particularly competent, but rather inadequate. This culture is further reinforced by a unique understanding of professional obligations, specifically, the Hippocratic Oath's admonition to [...] "use my power to help the sick {{to the best of}} <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> and judgment" [...] as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others.|$|E
2500|$|At almost 18 years old, Halep {{decided that}} her large breasts were interfering with her tennis and {{underwent}} a breast reduction surgical procedure to reduce her bust size; she later explained the decision, stating, [...] "It's the weight that troubles me. <b>My</b> <b>ability</b> to react quickly; my breasts make me uncomfortable when I play. I don’t like {{them in my}} everyday life, either. I would have gone for surgery even if I hadn’t been a sportswoman." [...] She also experienced back pain.
