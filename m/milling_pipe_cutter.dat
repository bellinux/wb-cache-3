40|$|Purpose. Modernization of {{cold-rolled}} <b>pipes</b> <b>mills</b> {{in order}} to increase functionality, regardless of their physical wear and tear. Design/methodology/approach. Constantly increasing demands on the pipe geometry and properties of materials perfectly satisfied by cold rolling (HPT), which evolves by optimizing the modes of deformation and improvement of equipment for its implementation. It offers system-modular approach to modernize the equipment of cold rolling mills, realizing one of the few non-waste technologies for the production of products with high consumer characteristics. The main producers of cold-rolled <b>pipes</b> <b>mills</b> (company SMS Meer and NGOs EZTM) more than a 80 year period of existence and development of technology HPT released about a thousand <b>mill</b> <b>pipe</b> diameters from 4 to 450 mm. Findings. System-modular approach to the unit that implements the method of production of goods HPT, based on the analysis of both technological and regime of the functioning of its mechanisms, and design options for their execution and layout, allows efficient use of the existing equipment and, if necessary, to expand its capabilities. The growing demand for cold-rolled tube can be satisfied both by the modernization of existing units and replacing them with new ones. For the design and manufacture of advanced mill HPT Ukraine has not only technical capabilities but also professionals able to offer solutions {{at the level of the}} best world standards. Originality/value. As part of undergoing a painful restructuring of the Ukrainian pipe production is more than 200 cold rolling <b>mills</b> <b>pipes</b> of different sizes and constructive accomplishments.

40|$|Abstract: Tubular {{products}} in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> {{are produced by}} different methods in wide range of sizes and materials for various applications. From simple ERW steel tubes to high quality and expensive seamless tubes, depending on the application, different NDT techniques are used extensively. All these tests are implemented to fulfil the required specification or standard {{as well as for}} condition monitoring of the production lines. While on-line test has the advantage of real time inspection by less investment, off-line test is final inspection and more reliable. Selecting a suitable NDT method is possible by optimizing between the costs and reliability in parallel with requirements of the international standards. Today different standards like API, ASTM, ANSI/AWWA, DIN, BS, SEP are used extensively in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> but all these standards give options to select test technique and test palce. In many <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> NDT is not used as they beleive it is an expensive test that reduces the production speed. While, by implementing proper NDT method in proper stage it is neither expensive nor reduces the production speed. In this paper the applicable NDT methods are evaluated according to the international standards for various tubes on the base of longterm experience in Iranian <b>pipe</b> <b>mills.</b> Introduction: Metalic <b>pipes</b> and tubes are classified in different cataegories depending on the material, size, production technique and applications.

40|$|The Hanford Site C Reactor Technology Demonstration Group {{demonstrated}} the High-Speed Clamshell <b>Pipe</b> <b>Cutter</b> technology, developed and marketed by Tri Tool Inc. (Rancho Cordova, California). The models demonstrated are portable, split-frame pipe lathes that require minimal radial and axial clearances for severing and/or beveling in-line pipe with ranges of 25 cm to 41 cm and 46 cm to 61 cm nominal diameter. The radial clearance requirement from the walls, floors, or adjacent pipes is 18 cm. The lathes were supplied with carbide insert conversion kits for the cutting bits for the high-speed technique that was demonstrated. Given site-specific factors, this demonstration showed {{the cost of}} the improved technology to be approximately 30 % higher than the traditional (baseline) technology (oxyacetylene torch) cost of $ 14, 400 for 10 cuts of contaminated 41 -cm and 61 -cm-diameter pipe at C Reactor. Actual cutting times were faster than the baseline technology; however, moving/staging the equipment took longer. Unlike the baseline torch, clamshell lathes do not involve applied heat, flames, or smoke and can be operated remotely, thereby helping personal exposures to be as low as reasonably achievable.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} specific face-mask removal tools during football helmet face-mask retraction using 3 -dimensional (3 -D) video. Design and Setting: Four different tools were used: the anvil pruner (AP), polyvinyl chloride <b>pipe</b> <b>cutters</b> (PVC), Face Mask (FM) Extractor (FME), and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel (TA). Subjects retracted a face mask once with each tool. Subjects: Eleven certified athletic trainers served as subjects and were recruited from among local sports medicine professionals. Measurements: We analyzed a sample of movement by 3 -D techniques during the retraction process. Movement of the head in 3 planes and time to retract the face mask were also assessed. All results were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures one-way multivariate analysis of variance. An overall efficiency score was calculated for each tool. Results: The AP allowed subjects to perform the face-mask removal task the fastest. Face mask removal with the AP was significantly faster than with the PVC and TA and significantly faster with the TA than the PVC. The PVC and AP created significantly more movement than the FME and TA when planes were combined. No significant differences were noted among tools for flexion-extension, rotation, or lateral flexion. The AP had an efficiency score of 14; FME, 15; TA, 18; and PVC, 35.

Design and Setting: Each subject performed one trial with the anvil pruner (AP), Face Mask Extractor (FME), PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter</b> (PVC), and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel (TA). Each subject cut through 4 loop straps and removed the face mask while kneeling behind the athlete 2 ̆ 7 s head. Subjects: Twenty-nine certified athletic trainers (age 29. 5 +/- 6. 2 years, athletic training experience = 6. 3 +/- 5. 0 years). Measurements: Time {{to complete the task}} was recorded. Total range of motion and total movement of the helmet were assessed using a 6 -camera, 3 -dimensional motion-capture system. Satisfaction scores were measured for each subject for each tool. Efficiency scores were calculated using time and total helmet-movement data. Results: When using the FME, subjects were significantly faster than with all other tools (P 3 ̆c. 05), and when using the AP and TA, they were significantly faster than with the PVC. No differences were noted between tools in either movement variable. Significant differences were noted for satisfaction (P 3 ̆c. 05) for all comparisons except TA versus AP. Efficiency scores were FME, 11. 6; AP, 14. 3; TA, 14. 5; and PVC, 22. 9, with lower scores identifying increased efficiency.
