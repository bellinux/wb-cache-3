50|$|In 2013, Airbus said, {{for long}} haul flights, {{there should be}} an {{industry}} standard for a <b>minimum</b> <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> of 18-inches in economy cabins, but its rival Boeing argued it was up for airlines to decide. People get bigger as a result of change in diets, the weight of the average American male in his 40s has increased by 10 percent between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century. The narrower 17 inches wide seat favoured by Boeing is a legacy from the 1950s when passenger jets were first introduced. In the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of the Boeing 747 and the first Airbus jets, 18-inches become standard for long-haul flights. Seats were widened to 18.5 inches with the Boeing 777 in the 1990s and A380 superjumbo in the 2000s. Many airlines are adopting lighter 17-inch-wide seats on their Boeing 777 and 787 and 18-inch seats for A350s. Although for almost 20 years, the standard setup {{in the back of a}} Boeing 777 was nine seats per row, in 2012 nearly 70% of the biggest version of that plane were delivered with 10-abreast seating. When Airbus introduced its A380, it offered 10-abreast seating, giving each passenger up to 19 inches of hip space. In 2013, ten airlines fly Airbus A330 with nine 16.7-inch seats in each row, rather than the eight it was designed for. A research commissioned by Airbus shows an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to determine a suitable method for measuring the maximum pressures occurring in aircraft engine cylinders. The study and development of instruments for the measurement of maximum cylinder pressures has been conducted in connection with carburetor and oil engine investigations on a single cylinder aircraft-type engine. Five maximum cylinder-pressure devices have been designed, and tested, {{in addition to the}} testing of three commercial indicators. Values of maximum cylinder pressures are given as obtained with various indicators for the same pressures and for various kinds and values of maximum cylinder pressures, produced chiefly by variation of the injection advance angle in high-speed oil engine. The investigations indicate that the greatest accuracy in determining maximum cylinder pressures can be obtained with an electric, balanced-pressure, diaphragm or disk-type indicator so constructed as to have a diaphragm or disk of relatively large area and <b>minimum</b> <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> and mass...|$|E

50|$|The new XWB {{fuselage}} has {{a constant}} width from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous Airbus aircraft, to provide maximum usable volume. The double-lobe (ovoid) fuselage cross-section has a maximum outer diameter of 5.97 m, compared to 5.64 m for the A330/A340. The cabin's internal diameter will be 5.61 m wide at armrest level compared with 5.49 m in the Boeing 787 and 5.87 m in the Boeing 777. It allows for an eight-abreast 2-4-2 arrangement in a premium economy layout, with the seats being 49.5 cm wide between 5 cm wide arm rests. Airbus {{says that the}} <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> will be 1.3 cm greater than a 787 seat in the equivalent configuration. In the nine-abreast, 3-3-3 standard economy layout, the XWB's <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> will be 45 cm which will be 1.27 cm wider than the equivalent seat layout for the 787, and 3.9 cm wider than the equivalent A330 layout. The current 777 and future derivatives have 1.27 cm greater <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> than the A350 in a nine-abreast configuration. The 10-abreast seating on the A350 {{is similar to a}} 9-abreast configuration on the A330, with a <b>seat</b> <b>width</b> of 41.65 cm.
