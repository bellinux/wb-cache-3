40|$|Can {{we teach}} ethics, {{and if we}} can how should we do it? Do we want our {{students}} to know moral theory or act morally? This paper assumes that the objective of 'teaching ethics' is to cultivate the possibility for moral conduct in the everyday world of institutional life. As teachers we know how to teach moral theory but how do we encourage our students to act morally. To attempt an answer I will present some ideas from the work of Levinas and Derrida. With Levinas I will argue that ethics happens in the singularity of the face of the Other before me 'here and now'. Ethics matter in my everyday contact with the Other that confronts me and claims <b>my</b> <b>response.</b> But what <b>about</b> all other Others simultaneously present? What about justice for all other Others? With Levinas and Derrida I will attempt to articulate the notion of 'caring justice'. In caring justice I want to show how the demands of ethics (the singular) and the demands of justice (all other Others) can become the impossible possibility for a "justice where there is no distinction between those close and those far off, but in which there also remains the impossibility of passing by the closest. " Furthermore, I want to argue for the need of Aristotle's notion of ethics as a habit-caring justice as the cultivation of moral character by doing. Finally, to demonstrate what I mean I discuss a singular case of intellectual property right. In this 'case' I try to show how caring justice can help us not to teach ethics, but do it [...] almos...|$|R

40|$|Constructivists {{hold that}} truths about {{practical}} reasons {{are to be}} {{explained in terms of}} truths <b>about</b> the <b>correct</b> exercise of practical reason (rather than vice versa). But what is the normative status of the correctness-defining standards of practical reason? The problem is that constructivism appears to presuppose the truth of two theses that seem hard to reconcile. First, for constructivism to be remotely plausible, the relevant standards must be genuinely (and not merely formally or minimally) normative. Second, to avoid circularity, the relevant standards must be non-reason-involving, i. e. prior to and independent of practical reasons. From the standpoint of the contemporary philosophy of normatively, this is a surprising combination to say the least. What could these genuinely normative but non-reason-involving standards possibly be? The standard constructivist response is to insist that the relevant standards possess a special kind of necessity inasmuch as we only count as occupying the “deliberative standpoint” or as a “deliberative agent” insofar as we comply with or accept the relevant standards. I offer a different <b>response.</b> <b>My</b> <b>response</b> holds that the special normative status of the relevant standards consists in their exhibiting a distinctive kind of practical necessity that derives from the fact that they determine what I have called elsewhere truths about “the thing to do” – namely, truths <b>about</b> <b>correct</b> answers {{to the question of what}} to do. Understanding the norms of practical reason in these terms vindicates the idea that standards of practical reason are genuinely normative since truths about the thing to do plausibly possess the hallmarks of genuine normativity. And it vindicates the idea that the standards are not reason-involving since truths about the thing to do are plausibly prior to and independent of truths about practical reasons...|$|R
