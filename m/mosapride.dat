The benefit of the prokinetic <b>mosapride</b> is modest.|$|E
50|$|Metoclopramide is a {{substituted}} benzamide; cisapride and <b>mosapride</b> are structurally related.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{in a study}} {{conducted}} with healthy adult volunteers, itopride was shown as unlikely to cause cardiac arrhythmias or ECG changes {{in part to the}} lack of significant interaction and metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, unlike cisapride and <b>mosapride,</b> as it is metabolized by a different enzyme set. New molecular studies on guinea pig ventricular myocytes also supported the cardiac safety profile of itopride, as it did not affect certain potassium mechanisms that may have been affected by cisapride or <b>mosapride.</b> Moreover, itopride has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors, unlike other benzamides such as cisapride and <b>mosapride,</b> which are 5-HT4 agonists. The affinity of cisapride for 5-HT4 receptors in the heart has been implicated in the undesirable cardiac effects of cisapride itself.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly {{some other}} {{selective}} 5-HT4 agonists such as <b>mosapride</b> and tegaserod (the only5-HT4 agonists currently licensed {{for use in}} humans) have been found not to reduce respiratory depression. On the other hand, another 5-HT4 agonist, zacopride, does inhibit respiratory depression {{in a similar manner}} to BIMU-8.|$|E
50|$|The third common {{mechanism}} which analeptics {{take advantage}} of is to act as serotonin receptor agonists. Buspirone and <b>Mosapride</b> successfully increased respiration in animals by binding to serotonin receptors which are G protein coupled receptors which, upon activation, induce a secondary messenger cascade {{and in this case}} that cascade leads to an analeptic response.|$|E
50|$|Several {{drugs that}} act as 5-HT4 {{selective}} agonists have recently been introduced into use in both scientific research and clinical medicine. Some drugs {{that act as}} 5-HT4 agonists are also active as 5-HT3 antagonists, such as <b>mosapride,</b> metoclopramide, renzapride, and zacopride, and so these compounds cannot be considered highly selective. Research {{in this area is}} ongoing.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while {{a combination of}} an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4).

The benefit of the prokinetic <b>mosapride</b> is modest.|$|E
50|$|The {{conclusion}} of this study revealed that itopride is devoid of any abnormal effect on QT interval. Therefore, {{it may be possible}} that itopride could be considered as a better and certainly safer prokinetic agent than either cisapride or <b>mosapride,</b> and itopride should also be considered a welcome treatment addition for symptomatic nonulcer dyspepsia and other gastric motility disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Drug therapy: Drug {{therapy for}} {{blepharospasm}} has proved generally unpredictable and short-termed. Finding an effective regimen for any patient usually requires {{trial and error}} over time. Anticholinergics, tranquillizing drugs and botulinum toxin are the mostly used therapeutic options. However serious side effects can be observed as well as failure of therapy. It is therefore not surprising that new therapies are constantly being tested. In this backdrop new evidence shows <b>Mosapride</b> can be a safe and affordable therapeutic option for blepharospasm.|$|E
50|$|This {{suggests}} {{that either the}} anti-respiratory depression action is mediated via a specific subtype of the 5-HT4 receptor which is activated by BIMU-8 and zacopride, but not by <b>mosapride</b> or tegaserod, or alternatively there may be functional selectivity involved whereby BIMU-8 and zacopride produce a different physiological response following 5-HT4 binding compared to other 5-HT4 agonists. Another alternative to {{this is that the}} 5-HT4 agonist currently available for use in humans do not have great enough potency or bioavailability in the brain to elicit the same effects.|$|E
50|$|The 5-HT4 {{receptor}} {{is thought}} to {{play a significant role}} in both the physiology and pathophysiology of GI tract motility. Therefore, 5-HT4 receptors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to GI dysmotility such as chronic constipation. Some of these prokinetic agents, such as <b>mosapride</b> and cisapride, classic benzamides, have only moderate affinity for 5HT4 receptors. In recent years, it has become clear that the selectivity profile is a major determinant of the risk-benefit profile of this class of agent. As such, the relatively poor selectivity profile of cisapride versus other receptors (especially hERG ether-a-go-go K+ channels) contributes to its potential to cause cardiac arrhythmias. Prucalopride, a first in class benzofuran, is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist that stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force to defecation. SSRIs have been found to have prokinetic actions on the small intestine.|$|E

However, the effects ofadjunctive <b>mosapride</b> citrate on {{the improvement of the}} participant’sstress were not fully understood. METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, open-label studyof <b>mosapride</b> in addition to PEG solution. A participant received oneof two regimens in bowel preparation for colonoscopy [1 500 mLPEG plus <b>mosapride</b> citrate (<b>mosapride</b> group) or 2 000 mL PEGalone (control group) ]. The bowel preparation status was comparedbetween the two groups. Patients completed a questionnaire reportingthe tolerability of the bowel preparation process. Salivary alphaamylase(SAA) was measured as a stress marker at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min of the bowel preparation. RESULTS: The bowel preparation status of the <b>mosapride</b> groupwas significantly better than that of the control group (P< 0. 05). There were no problematic adverse events in either group. A visualanalogue scale (VAS) of the discomfort assessment was significantlybetter in the <b>mosapride</b> group (P< 0. 05). The frequency of patientsthat complained of nausea was significantly lower in the mosapridegroup (P< 0. 05). Salivary alpha-amylase increased with consumptionof PEG, which means bowel preparation with PEG solution isstressful for participants. However, there were no differences in theSAA levels between the <b>mosapride</b> and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Mosapride</b> citrate was an effective and safeadjunct to PEG solution for bowel preparation.

40|$|Background and Aim. To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} electroacupuncture (EA) with different current intensities for functional constipation (FC) and to assess whether the effects of EA with different current intensities are superior to the <b>mosapride.</b> Methods. Patients with FC were randomly divided into low current intensity group (LCI), high current intensity group (HCI), and <b>mosapride</b> group (MC). The primary outcome was three or more spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week and an increase {{of one or more}} SBMs from baseline during at least 3 of the 4 weeks. Results. The primary outcome was reached by 53. 45 %, 66. 15 %, and 52. 24 % of the patients who received LCI, HCI, and <b>mosapride,</b> respectively.

Secondary peristalsis was induced with mid-esophageal air injections in 14 healthy subjects. We compared the effects on secondary peristalsis subsequent to capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce (pure capsaicin, 0. 84 mg) or 40 mg oral <b>mosapride.</b> The threshold volume for generating secondary peristalsis during slow air distensions was significantly decreased with capsaicin infusion compared to <b>mosapride</b> (11. 6 ± 1. 0 vs. 14. 1 ± 0. 8 mL, P = 0. 02). The threshold volume required to produce secondary peristalsis during rapid air distension was also significantly decreased with capsaicin infusion (4. 6 ± 0. 5 vs. 5. 2 ± 0. 6 mL, P = 0. 02).

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with <b>mosapride</b> in addition to polyethylene glycol (PEG) -electrolyte solution. Of 250 patients undergoing colonoscopy, 124 were randomized to receive 2 L PEG plus 15 mg of <b>mosapride</b> citrate (<b>mosapride</b> group), and 126 received 2 L PEG plus placebo (placebo group). Patients completed a questionnaire reporting the acceptability and tolerability of the bowel preparation process. The efficacy of bowel preparation was assessed by colonoscopists using a 5 -point scale based on Aronchick&#x 2019;s criteria. The primary end point was optimal bowel preparation rates (scores of excellent/good/fair vs poor/inadequate). RESULTS: A total of 249 patients {{were included in the}} analysis. In the <b>mosapride</b> group, optimal bowel preparation rates were significantly higher in the left colon compared with the placebo group (78. 2 % vs 65. 6 %, P < 0. 05), but not in the right colon (76. 5 % vs 66. 4 %, P = 0. 08). After excluding patients with severe constipation, {{there was a significant difference}} in bowel preparation in both the left and right colon (82. 4 % vs 66. 7 %, 80. 8 % vs 67. 5 %, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to formulate a fixed dose combination of chirally pure S (-) pantoprazole and <b>mosapride</b> citrate tablets. Since no systematic studies on the design and development of S (-) pantoprazole and <b>mosapride</b> citrate tablets in capsule approach are available in literature, we propose to develop a suitable formulation to characterize in-vitro release profile of both the tablets in capsules. Chirally pure S (-) pantoprazole tablets were prepared as delayed release, and <b>mosapride</b> citrate tablets were prepared as immediate release tablets. Methods: Enteric coating was done on S (-) pantoprazole tablets to modify its release in 6. 8 phosphate buffer. In-vitro dissolution of the capsule containing both the tablets was performed in two different media, 0. 1 N HCl and 6. 8 phosphate buffer, respectively.

40|$|It was {{recently}} reported that activation of enteric neural 5 -HT(4) receptors (SR 4) promotes reconstruction of enteric neural circuit injury in distal gut of guinea pigs {{and that this}} reconstruction involves neural stem cells. We aimed to explore a novel approach using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases endogenous 5 -HT, to repair enteric nerve fiber injury in the rat distal gut. Enteric nerve fiber injury was performed by rectal transection and subsequent end-to-end one-layer anastomosis. The SSRI fluvoxamine maleate (100 μmol/l) was applied locally at the anastomotic site to compare with the 5 -HT(4) agonist <b>mosapride</b> citrate (100 μmol/l) (applied for patent) applied locally and orally. Unlike <b>mosapride,</b> fluvoxamine failed to promote the regeneration of the nerve fiber tract across the anastomosis. Furthermore, fluvoxamine did not generate anti-distal-less homeobox 2 (DLX 2) - and anti-SR 4 -positive cells (neural stem cells) and/or anti-neurofilament (NF) -positive cells (neural cells) in newly formed granulation tissue at the anastomosis, whereas these cell types were observed in mosapride-treated preparations. In contrast to its effects in guinea pigs, <b>mosapride</b> generated 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -positive neural cells in ganglia sites 3 mm oral and anal from the anastomosis 2 wk after nerve fiber injury. All actions of <b>mosapride</b> were observed after local and or oral applications. These findings indicate that local SSRI treatment does not induce in vivo nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis in the rat distal gut. <b>Mosapride</b> induces nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis, mediated through enteric neural stem cells possibly from neural crest-derived stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow. 博士（医学）・甲 616 号・平成 26 年 3 月 17 日発行元の規定により、本文の登録不可。本文は以下のURLを参照 "[URL]...|$|E

After one week, the same procedure was repeated after ingestion of <b>mosapride</b> (5 mg for group 1, n = 8; 10 mg for group 2, n = 7) 15 min before the meal. Quantification of gastric residue by endoscopy was scored from 0 to 3, and the scores were added up. Results: All subjects completed the study without any complication. The gastric emptying rate [T 1 / 2 (min) ] was in normal range (65. 6 ± 12. 6 min). Endoscopic gastric emptying was correlated significantly with gastric clearance of ROMs (r = 0. 627, p = 0. 012). Endoscopic gastric emptying and gastric clearance of ROMs after administration of <b>mosapride</b> showed significant differences in the 10 mg group (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Endoscopy can evaluate gastric emptying safely and simply on an outpatient basis. A 10 mg dose of <b>mosapride</b> enhanced gastric emptying, assessed by both endoscopy and ROMs...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Simotang (Decoction of Four Powered Drugs) on gastrointestinal motility, motilin and cholecystokinin expression in chronically stressed mice. METHODS: Forty mice were randomly divided into control group, stress group (model group), <b>mosapride</b> group and Simotang group, 10 in each group. A variety of unpredictable stimulations were used to induce chronic stress in mice. Then, the mice were treated with distilled water, <b>mosapride</b> or Simotang for 7 d. Gastric emptying and intestinal propulsion function were detected. Serum level of motilin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of cholecystokinin (CCK) in intestine, spinal cord and brain of mice was detected by immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: Simotang improved the gastric emptying and intestinal propulsion in chronically stressed mice. Furthermore, the serum motilin level was significantly higher and the expression levels of CCK-positive cells and genes were significantly lower in intestine, spinal cord and brain of Simotang group than in those of model group (P < 0. 05). No {{significant difference was found}} in serum motilin level and expression levels of CCK-positive cells and genes between the <b>mosapride</b> and Simotang groups. CONCLUSION: Simotang enhances the gastrointestinal motility in chronically stressed mice by regulating the serum motilin level and the expression of cholecystokinin...|$|E
40|$|Background Probiotics can be {{beneficial}} in {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS). <b>Mosapride</b> citrate, a selective 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist, stimulates gastrointestinal motility. We investigated the efficacy of combination therapy with probiotics and <b>mosapride</b> for non-diarrheal-type IBS. Methods Two hundred and eighty-five IBS patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either a combination of probiotics (Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecium) and <b>mosapride</b> at one of four different doses or a placebo for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing adequate relief (AR) of global IBS symptoms at week 4. The secondary outcomes included subject&# 39;s global assessment (SGA) of IBS symptom relief, individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS-quality of life. Key Results The proportion of AR at week 4 was significantly higher in all treatment groups compared to the placebo group (53. 7 % in group 1, 55. 0 % in group 2, 55. 2 % in group 3, 53. 6 % in group 4 [the highest dose], and 35. 1 % in placebo group, respectively, p ? 0. 05). The proportion of patients reporting &# 39;completely or considerably relieved&# 39; in the SGA was higher in the treatment groups than in the placebo group. The abdominal pain/discomfort score in the treatment group 4 was more prominently improved compared with that of the placebo group. In patients with constipation-predominant IBS, the improvements in stool frequency and consistency were significantly higher in the treatment groups 4 and 1, respectively, than those in the placebo group. Conclusions Inferences Combination therapy with probiotics and <b>mosapride</b> is effective for relief of symptoms in patients with non-diarrheal-type IBS. The study has been registered in the US National Library of Medicine ([URL] NCT 01505777). This study was supported by a research fund from Hanmi Pharm., Co., Ltd. Korea...|$|E
40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{analyzed the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) {{for the treatment of}} irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). We searched seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of IBS-C. The search period was from inception to June 1, 2017. Eligible RCTs compared TCM with cisapride and <b>mosapride.</b> Article quality was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk Bias Tool in the Cochrane Handbook by two independent reviewers. Begg's test was performed to evaluate publication bias. Review Manager 5. 3 and Stata 12. 0 were used for analyses. Eleven eligible studies comprising a total of 906 participants were identified. In the primary outcome, TCM showed significant improvement in overall clinical efficacy compared with cisapride and <b>mosapride</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 4. 00; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 74, 5. 84; P < 0. 00001). In terms of secondary outcomes, TCM significantly alleviated abdominal pain (OR = 5. 69; 95 % CI: 2. 35, 13. 78; P = 0. 0001), defecation frequency (OR = 4. 38; 95 % CI: 1. 93, 9. 93. P = 0. 0004), and stool form (OR = 4. 96; 95 % CI: 2. 11, 11. 65; P = 0. 0002) in the treatment group as compared to the control group. A lower recurrence rate was associated with TCM as compared to cisapride and <b>mosapride</b> (OR = 0. 15; 95 % CI: 0. 08, 0. 27; P < 0. 00001). No adverse effects were observed during TCM treatment. TCM showed greater improvement in terms of clinical efficacy in the treatment of IBS-C than cisapride and <b>mosapride,</b> although {{it was not possible to}} draw a definitive conclusion due to the small sample size, high risk, and low quality of the studies. Large multi-center and long-term high-quality randomized control trials are needed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To compare {{efficacy}} of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) plus prokinetics (Proks) for dysmotility-like symptoms in functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: Subjects were randomized to receive open-label treatment with either rabeprazole 10 mg od (n = 57) or famotidine 10 mg bid plus <b>mosapride</b> 5 mg tid (n = 57) for 4 wk. The primary efficacy endpoint was change (%) from baseline in total dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptom score. The secondary efficacy endpoint was patient satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: The improvement in dysmotility-like dyspepsia symptom score on day 28 was significantly {{greater in the}} rabeprazole group (22. 5 % 1; 29. 2 % of baseline) than the famotidine + <b>mosapride</b> group (53. 2 % 1; 58. 6 % of baseline, P < 0. 0001). The superior benefit of rabeprazole treatment after 28 d was consistent regardless of Helicobacter pylori status. Significantly more subjects in the rabeprazole group were satisfied or very satisfied with treatment on day 28 than in the famotidine + <b>mosapride</b> group (87. 7 % vs 59. 6 %, P = 0. 0012). Rabeprazole therapy was the only significant predictor of treatment response (P < 0. 0001), defined as a total symptom score improvement &#x 2265; 50 %. CONCLUSION: PPI monotherapy improves dysmotility-like symptoms significantly better than H 2 RAs plus Proks, and should be the treatment of first choice for Japanese FD...|$|E
40|$|Bowel {{preparation}} {{prior to}} colonoscopy {{is essential to}} maximize the benefits of colonoscopy. Numerous bowel preparations have been studied, ranging from 4 L polyethylene glycol (PEG) to split-dose regimens to 2 L PEG with an adjunct laxative (senna, bisacodyl, ascorbic acid). Due to the large volume of PEG required for adequate bowel preparation, many {{studies have focused on}} reducing this large volume to only 2 L PEG with the addition of an adjunct. Recently, a randomized controlled trial by Tajika et al showed that the addition of <b>mosapride</b> to only 1. 5 L PEG was non-inferior to <b>mosapride</b> and 2 L PEG for bowel cleansing but did provide improvements in patient tolerance. This study offers yet another potential bowel preparation for patients undergoing colonoscopy and may trigger further studies with 1. 5 L PEG with an adjunct. In this letter, we discuss the current state of bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy and offer information to guide clinicians on choosing the appropriate bowel preparation for their patients...|$|E
