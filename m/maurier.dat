25|$|The Fish, Wildlife and Parks {{department}} {{underwent a}} significant restructuring {{in the spring}} of 2009. Joe <b>Maurier,</b> a long-time friend of Governor Schweitzer's, was hired to lead the department's Parks Division in 2006 allegedly after Schweitzer asked that he be hired (an allegation the governor denied). In November 2008, Schweitzer dismissed the long-time head of the MFWP and replaced him with <b>Maurier.</b> <b>Maurier</b> reassigned the department's Deputy Director, Chris Smith, to work on special projects and hired Art Noonan (a state legislator from Butte with no college degree and no hunting or fishing experience) as the new Deputy Director.

Prior to 2009, the department had separate divisions for communication and education, enforcement, fisheries, and wildlife.

Instead of reporting to a number of divisions, the regional administrators now reported {{to the head of the}} Fish and Wildlife Division.
