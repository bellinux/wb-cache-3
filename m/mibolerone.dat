50|$|In {{the case}} at hand, heating acetate (1) with {{chloranil}} gives the conjugated dieneone (2), and reaction of that compound with methylmagnesium bromide {{in the presence of}} cuprous chloride leads to addition of the methyl group to position 7 {{at the end of the}} conjugated system (3). The stereochemistry of the product again illustrates the preference for additions from the backside. The alcohol at C17 is then oxidized to a ketone (4). Enamines are commonly used to activate adjacent functions; they are also not infrequently used, as in this case, as protecting groups. Thus, reaction of the intermediate with pyrrolidine gives dienamine (5). This transformation emphasizes the clear difference in reactivity between ketones at C7 and C17. A second methyl Grignard addition gives the corresponding 17α-methyl derivative. Hydrolysis of the enamine function then affords <b>mibolerone</b> (6).|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved. Androgen signaling, {{mediated}} by the androgen receptor (AR), is a critical factor influencing growth of normal and malignant breast cells. Given {{the increasing use of}} exogenous androgens in women, a better understanding of androgen action in the breast is essential. This study compared the effects of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and a synthetic androgen, <b>mibolerone,</b> on estradiol (E(2)) -induced proliferation of breast cancer cells. DHT modestly inhibited E(2) -induced proliferation and <b>mibolerone</b> significantly inhibited proliferation in T- 47 D cells. The effects of both androgens could be reversed by an AR antagonist, suggesting that their actions were mediated, in part, by AR. Whereas high physiological doses (10 - 100 nM) of DHT reduced E(2) -mediated induction of the estrogen-regulated gene progesterone receptor (PR) to basal levels, <b>mibolerone</b> at lower doses (1 nM) eliminated PR expression, suggesting that <b>mibolerone</b> may also act via the PR. In the AR positive, PR-negative MCF- 7 cells, <b>mibolerone</b> had modest effects on E(2) -induced proliferation, but was a potent inhibitor of proliferation in the AR positive, PR positive MCF- 7 M 11 PRA cells.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of androgen production by thecal-interstitial cells (TIC) of the mammalian ovary {{is a complex}} process. Al-though androgen production is primarily controlled by LH, {{a variety of factors}} have been demonstrated to alter LH-stimulated androgen production. It is uncertain, however, if an androgen-mediated autoregulatory process for androgen production exists in TIC. To determine the existence of this phenomenon, TIC obtained from ovaries of immature hypophysectomized rats were enriched by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. When TIC (20 000 viable cells/ 0. 2 ml/well) were cultured for 48 h {{in the presence of a}} maximal concentration of hCG (0. 2 ng/ml), androsterone production was increased 26 -fold versus control levels. Treatment with increasing concentrations (5 - 1000 nM) of the synthetic androgen 17 {-hydroxy- 7 a, 17 a-dimethyl- 4 -estren- 3 -one (<b>mibolerone)</b> inhibited hCG-stimulated androsterone production by an average of 32 % at every dose tested. <b>Mibolerone</b> (100 nM) alone was without effect on basal levels of androgens. The addition of insulin (100 ng/ml) or insulin-like growth factor I (100 ng/ml) to TIC cultures did not alter the basal accumulation of androsterone but significantly augmented hCG-induced androgen production by 2 - and 3 -fold, respectively, versus controls. Concomitant treatment with <b>mibolerone</b> (100 nM) decreased the synergistic action of insulin or IGF-I on hCG-stimulated androsterone synthesis by 46 % and 40 %, respectively.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} canine liver microsomal assay was {{developed}} {{for the purpose of}} generating metabolites from the anabolic steroids testosterone, methyltestosterone, <b>mibolerone,</b> and boldenone. Identification of their in vitro biotransformation products was used to predict possible in vivo metabolites typically extracted from urine of racing greyhounds. The microsomal assay was optimized for incubation time and volume as well as substrate and protein concentration. Metabolite identifications were based on interpretation of chromatographic retention, ultraviolet spectral, mass spectral M+ 1 ions, and source induced dissociation mass spectral fragmentation data. Analysis of deuterium labeled, 13 C labeled, and structurally related steroids allowed for the identity and possible fragmentation mechanisms of the primary source induced fragment ions (m/z 97, m/z 109, and m/z 123) of testosterone. Metabolites were identified in beagle and greyhound microsomes to assess breed differences in steroid biotransformation. Primary beagle microsomal metabolites were identified as androstenedione and 6 β-hydroxytestosterone for testosterone, 6 β-hydroxymethyl-testosterone and a monohydroxymethyltestosterone for methyltestosterone, two monohydroxymibolerones for <b>mibolerone,</b> and a monohydroxyboldenone, an oxidized boldenone, and testosterone for boldenone. Primary greyhound microsomal metabolites were identified as androstenedione and 16 α-hydroxytestosterone for testosterone, 6 β-hydroxymethyltestosterone and two monohydroxymethyltestosterones for methyltestosterone, two monohydroxymibolerones for <b>mibolerone,</b> and three monohydroxyboldenones, an oxidized boldenone, testosterone, and a boldenone isomer for boldenone. Beagle microsomes appear to be a good model to predict in vitro greyhound steroid biotransformation products. Greyhound administration studies were performed to determine the predictability of the in vitro microsomal assay for urinary metabolites and to assess temporal excretion profiles of these investigated steroids. Primary urinary metabolites for testosterone were identified as a ketotestosterone, a testosterone isomer, and a reduced monohydroxytestosterone. Primary urinary metabolites for methyltestosterone were identified as a reduced methyltestosterone, an oxidized monohydroxymethyltestosterone, and a reduced monohydroxymethyltestosterone. Four monohydroxymibolerones were the primary urinary metabolites for <b>mibolerone.</b> One of the monohydroxymibolerones was consistent with a metabolite identified in both the beagle and greyhound microsomal assays. Primary urinary metabolites for boldenone were identified as an oxidized monohydroxyboldenone, a monohydroxyboldenone, and two reduced monohydroxyboldenones. Minimal correlates existed between the metabolites generated in vitro and in vivo. The discrepancies are likely due to the limitations of the microsomal system. ...|$|E

After acclimatization and weaning to artificial feed, the feed given daily (4 % BW/day) was supplemented with 0, 50, 100, and 200 Î¼g mibolerone/kg feed for about 18 weeks. Thereafter, the hormone treatment was withdrawn and the experiment was terminated at Week 24. Ten fish were killed for gonad histology at stocking to serve as an initial control while about three to five fish were killed every 8 weeks. In general, ovaries of initial controls showed the presence of moderate stromal cells and gonia and few primary oocytes. At Weeks 8 and 16, ovaries of the control fish (0 Î¼g/kg) were {{similar to that of the}} initial control except that primary oocytes increased at Week 24. Gonads of fish fed diets containing 100 and 200 Î¼g/kg had none to moderate spermatocytes and few spermatids at Week 8 and 16, although spermatozoa were not observed, indicating that the fish were undergoing spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis at 50 Î¼g/kg was not as advanced since only few spermatocytes occurred at Weeks 8 followed by moderate gonia and no spermatocytes and spermatids at Week 16. However, the presence of few primary oocytes was observed when <b>mibolerone</b> was withdrawn suggesting that sex-inversed fish reverted back to a female condition.

From epidemiological studies raised levels of androgens have been implicated {{to increase the}} risk of developing the disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the responses of normal human ovarian surface epithelium to androgens. We have established primary cultures of human ovarian surface epithelium from patients undergoing oophorectomy for benign disease. Total RNA was isolated from these cultures and expression of mRNA encoding for the androgen receptor was demonstrated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The presence of androgen receptor in sections of normal ovary was also investigated using an antibody against androgen receptor. The effects of androgens on DNA synthesis and cell death were determined. Eight out of eight (100 %) cultures expressed mRNA encoding the androgen receptor. The presence of androgen receptor in ovarian surface epithelium of sections of normal ovaries was demonstrated in all sections. <b>Mibolerone,</b> a synthetic androgen, caused a significant stimulation of DNA synthesis in 5 out of 9 (55 %) cultures when used at a concentration of 1 [*]nM. <b>Mibolerone</b> also caused a significant decrease in cell death in 2 out of 5 (40 %) cultures tested.

Preincubation of Sertoli cells for 4 days with FSH, testosterone, or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone results into a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in <b>mibolerone</b> binding, as measured 18 h after removal of the agonists. The combination of androgens and FSH has additive effects. The action of FSH can be mimicked by (Bu) 2 cAMP, and {{the activity of the}} androgens can be blocked by the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. The mibolerone-binding protein has the ligand specificity, affinity, and sedimentation behavior characteristic for an androgen receptor. Using a DEAE-cellulose filter disc assay and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone as a ligand, androgen-binding protein (ABP) was measured in the media of the studied Sertoli cell cultures. Despite some similarity in the hormonal control of ABP and the androgen receptor, there are distinct differences in the ligand specificity of the two androgen binding proteins, which exclude that ABP might interfere with the receptor measurements. The effects of androgens and FSH on the androgen receptor are evident at concentrations equal to or lower than those required to provoke a measurable increase in ABP secretion.

40|$|Autoregulation is {{a control}} {{mechanism}} common to several proteins of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. In this work {{the effect of}} androgens and antiandrogens on {{the expression of the}} human androgen receptor (hAR) in prostate and breast cancer cell lines was studied. Northern blot analysis revealed a decrease in hAR steady state RNA levels in LNCaP cells by 3. 3 nht of the synthetic androgen <b>mibolerone.</b> Maximal down-regulation of hAR RNA to 30 % of control levels occurred 48 h after hormone addition. T 47 D breast cancer cells showed a similar effect with <b>mibolerone,</b> while hAR expression in normal skin fibroblasts did not respond to androgen treatment. As shown by nuclease Sl analysis, hAR transcripts initiate at three principal start sites, all of which are equally sensitive to androgen. Steroidal as well as nonsteroidal antiandrogens were capable of partially antagonizing androgen- mediated hAR RNA down-regulation in LNCaP and T 47 D cells, while not exerting a significant effect when administered alone. While hAR RNA stability was increased by hormone, nuclear run-on analysis revealed a 4 -fold reduction of hAR gene transcrip tion 98 h after androgen treatment. Although decreased hAR RNA levels did not coincide with a parallel decrease in AR protein levels, analysis of androgen-inducible reporter constructs demonstrated that prolonged androgen administration to ceils results in a progressively impaired sensitivity of the intracellular androgen response mechanism. These results show that prolonged androgen exposure leads, besides its effect on hAR RNA levels, to functional inactivation of the AR. Thus, in viva, posttranslational control of AR activity appears to be a novel mechanism of negative autoregulation of androgen effects on gene expression. ...|$|E

All metabolites, except 8, were identified as new compounds. This study indicates that C. blakesleeana, and C. echinulata are able to catalyze hydroxylation at allylic positions, while M. phaseolina can catalyze hydroxylation of CH 2 and CH 3 groups of substrate 1. <b>Mibolerone</b> (1) was found to be a moderate inhibitor of β-glucuronidase enzyme (IC 50 = 42. 98 ± 1. 24 μM) during random biological screening, while its metabolites 2 - 4, and 8 were found to be inactive. <b>Mibolerone</b> (1) was also found to be significantly active against Leishmania major promastigotes (IC 50 = 29. 64 ± 0. 88 μM).

40|$|In the ligand-binding {{inactive}} state, {{the steroid}} receptor heterocomplex contains Hsp 90, Hsp 70, high–molecular weight immunophilins, and other proteins.

It was reported earlier that Hsp 90 {{might not be as}} important for the androgen receptor (AR) activity as for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the progesterone receptor (PR) activities. We used the Hsp 90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) to explore the role of Hsp 90 in the function of the AR heterocomplex. GA selectively binds to Hsp 90 and inhibits its activity, leading to the loss of steroid receptor activity, and frequently, its degradation. In our study, LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with GA for 30 minutes or 24 hours, in the presence of <b>mibolerone,</b> a synthetic androgen. GA reduced the androgen-induced AR protein levels to 15  % after 24 hours of treatment. Several androgen up-regulated genes, including immunophilin FKBP 51 and prostate specific antigen (PSA), were reduced by GA treatment. In cells treated with GA after transfection with a PSA promoter or an androgen response element–driven reporter gene, AR-mediated transactivation of reporter gene expression was reversibly inhibited by GA. Loss of androgen-binding ability and AR levels was attributed to reduced transcription of AR-regulated gene expression. Degradation rate of[*] 35 S-labeled AR was significantly increased by GA in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>mibolerone.</b> GA induced the degradation of AR through the proteasomal pathway.

40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) remains an important {{contributor to the}} neoplastic evolution of prostate cancer (CaP). CaP progression is linked to several somatic AR mutational changes that endow upon the AR dramatic gain-of-function properties. One {{of the most common}} somatic mutations identified is Thr 877 -to-Ala (T 877 A), located in the ligand-binding domain, that results in a receptor capable of promiscuous binding and activation by a variety of steroid hormones and ligands including estrogens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and several anti-androgens. In an attempt to further define somatic mutated AR gain-of-function properties, as a consequence of its promiscuous ligand binding, we undertook a proteomic/ network analysis approach to characterize the protein interactome of the mutant T 877 A-AR in LNCaP cells under eight different ligand-specific treatments (dihydrotestosterone, <b>mibolerone,</b> R 1881, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, dexamethasone, and cyproterone acetate). In extending the analysis of our multi-ligand complexes of the mutant T 877 A-AR we observed significant enrichment of specific complexes between normal and primary prostatic tumors, which were furthermore correlated with known clinical outcomes. Further analysis of certain mutant T 877 A-AR complexes showed specific population preferences distinguishing primary prostatic disease between white (non-Hispanic) vs. African-American males. Moreover, these cancer-related AR-protein complexes demonstrated predictive survival outcomes specific to CaP, and not for breast, lung, lymphoma or medulloblastoma cancers.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to compare the relationship between response to exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) and {{the expression of the}} EGF-receptor (EGF-R) in an androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and insensitive (DU 145) prostate cancer cell line. Although both cell lines demonstrated a single EGF-R binding site of similar high affinities (mean dissociation constant (Kd) +/- S. D. for DU 145 = 1. 0 +/- 0. 6 nmol l- 1; LNCaP = 2. 8 +/- 2. 2 nmol l- 1) the number of binding sites (RT) for the hormone insensitive DU 145 cells (mean +/- S. D. = 2. 5 +/- 1. 0 x 10 (5) sites/cell) and 10 -fold greater than that expressed in the androgen responsive LNCaP cell line (mean +/- S. D. = 2. 0 +/- 1 x 10 (4) sites/cell). Additionally exogenous EGF only minimally affected the growth and DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells whereas LNCaP cells showed a significant response which was dose dependent. The autologous production of EGF-like molecules by DU 145 cells is believed to reduce the cells needs for exogenous mitogens, thereby rendering the cells autostimulatory. Treatment of LNCaP cells with <b>Mibolerone</b> [...] a synthetic androgen [...] did not affect either the expression of the EGF receptor or the proliferative response observed with EGF. Western blot analysis, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGF receptor revealed a band of approximately 170 kD with DU 145 cell lysates but the LNCaP EGF receptor was not detected using this technique...|$|E
40|$|Using gene-specific {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides {{the expression}} and regulation of kallikrein-like {{genes in the}} human prostatic cancer cell line LNCaP were studied. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and human glandular kallikrein (hGK- 1) together constitute a subfamily of serine proteases exclusively produced in the human prostate. RNA analysis revealed that both genes are expressed in LNCaP cells with PSA basal levels being 2 -fold higher than hGK- 1 levels. Both mRNAs are induced {{over a period of}} 24 h in the presence of 3. 3 nM of the synthetic androgen <b>mibolerone.</b> Stimulation of PSA RNA is about 5 - fold,whereas hGK- 1 stimulation is less pronounced. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that androgen induction of kallikrein-like genes in LNCaP cells is a rapid event (c 3 h) occurring at the level of transcription initiation. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide demonstrates that, while PSA/hGK- 1 basal transcription strictly depends on continuous protein synthesis, transcriptional induction by androgen does not. This suggests the direct involvement of the androgen receptor in the induction process independent of additional labile protein factors necessary for kallikrein basal transcription. A binding motif is present in the PSA and hGK- 1 promoters, closely resembling the consensus sequence for steroidresponsive elements. The androgen antagonist cyproterone acetate was also able to stimulate transcription of kallikrein-like genes in LNCaP cells. In contrast, androgen-dependent transcriptional suppression of the protooncogene c-myc was strongly counteracted by cyproterone acetate. Thus, antiandrogens act differentially on androgen-regulated prostate-specific (PSA, hGK- 1) and growthrelated (c-myc) gene expression in LNCaP cells. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of androgen receptors in the ovaries of several vertebrate species, including Atlantic croaker, suggests that an-drogens may have {{important roles in}} ovarian function. In the current {{study the effects of}} androgens on ovarian steroidogen-esis in Atlantic croaker were investigated. Addition of 17 b-hy-droxy- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one (DHT), 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT), or <b>Mibolerone</b> to ovarian incubations caused dose-dependent decreases in gonadotropin-stimulated in vitro estradiol produc-tion, which was not reversed by cotreatment with the antian-drogens, cyproterone acetate or 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chloro-phenyl) ethylene. Androgen treatment also caused significant decreases in estradiol production in the {{presence of}} 17 -hydroxy-progesterone, which suggests that the site of androgen action is downstream of this steroid in the steroidogenic pathway. The mechanism of androgen action on ovarian steroidogenesis was also investigated. Coincubation with actinomycin D did not re-verse the inhibitory effect of the androgens, which suggests that the mechanism of androgen action is nongenomic. An androgen conjugated to bovine serum albumin (DHT-BSA), which does not enter the cell, also caused inhibition of estradiol production in vitro, indicating that the androgen is acting at the cell surface. In addition, time course experiments revealed that the androgen action is rapid; 5 -min exposure to DHT was sufficient to cause a significant reduction in estradiol production. Finally, prelimi-nary evidence was obtained for the existence of a high-affinity, low-capacity androgen binding site in croaker ovarian plasma membranes. These studies suggest that androgens can down-reg-ulate estrogen production in croaker ovaries via a rapid, cell surface-mediated, nongenomic mechanism. androgen receptor, estradiol, ovary, steroid hormone...|$|E
40|$|Additional contributor: Scott M. Dehm (faculty mentor). It is {{estimated}} that one in six men in North America will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) during his lifetime. Localized PCa is often treated using surgery and radiation. Advanced and metastatic PCa can be treated by blocking the production or action of androgens, the male sex hormones. This androgen depletion therapy is only temporarily successful because PCa frequently returns in an androgen-refractory form that is resistant to hormonal manipulations and capable of growing in an androgen-depleted environment. Androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor necessary for normal prostate cell growth and function {{as well as for}} growth of PCa. Androgens activate the AR, which translocates to the nucleus where it transcriptionally activates or represses target genes. One such gene is the Maspin tumor suppressor. Maspin is a proteinase inhibitor that serves to prevent proteinase degradation of the extracellular matrix, which is prerequisite to tumor invasion and metastasis. Androgens transcriptionally repress Maspin, but the mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized. To investigate the mechanisms of Maspin repression, a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene {{under the control of the}} Maspin promoter was constructed and transfected into VCaP and LNCaP PCa cell lines. Transfected cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone (a natural androgen) or <b>mibolerone</b> (a synthetic androgen) for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was subsequently measured by dual luciferase assay. These experiments have indicated that the AR may not directly repress Maspin transcription. Ongoing research will utilize real time PCR to determine whether AR inhibits Maspin transcription via a direct or indirect mechanism. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} estrogens and xenoestrogens on tes-ticular androgen production were investigated in an in vitro in-cubation bioassay system using testicular tissue from the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Incubation of testicular tis-sue fragments with estradiol over the concentration range of 37 nM to 37 mM caused concentration-dependent decreases in go-nadotropin-stimulated 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) production. The effect was specific for estrogens; progesterone, cortisol, and the synthetic androgen <b>mibolerone</b> {{did not significantly}} alter 11 -KT production at similar concentrations. Diethylstilbestrol, the antiestrogen ICI 182, 780, and several xenoestrogens including Kepone (chlordecone), 4 -nonylphenol, and a hydroxylated poly-chlorinated biphenyl metabolite also significantly decreased go-nadotropin-stimulated 11 -KT production. The action of estradiol was rapid (, 5 min) and was not blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors of transcription and translation, re-spectively. Moreover, estradiol conjugated to BSA, which cannot pass through the cell membrane, also caused a decrease in 11 -KT production. In addition, an estrogen-binding moiety was identified in testicular membrane preparations that had a single class of high-affinity (Kd 1. 6 nM), saturable (1. 2 nM), displace-able, finite (Bmax 0. 03 nM, 26 fmol/g testis) binding sites specific for estrogens and exhibited rapid association (t 1 / 2 5 5 min), characteristics typical of steroid membrane receptors. Overall the relative binding affinities of estrogens, other steroids, anti-estrogens, and xenoestrogens for the membrane preparation correlated with their activities in the androgen production bio-assay, thereby satisfying the final criteria for the designation of this estrogen-binding moiety as a steroid membrane receptor. The results demonstrate that estrogens and also probably xen-oestrogens can act on the cell surface via a nongenomic mech-anism to alter testicular androgen production in this vertebrate species...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) {{is present in}} many cells in two forms. The B form migrates with an apparent mass of 110 kDa and constitutes more than 80 % of the immunoreactive receptor in most cell types. The A form of the AR migrates with an apparent mass of 87 kDa, appears to derive from internal translation initiation at methionine- 188 in the AR open-reading frame, and usually constitutes 20 % or less of the immunoreactive AR present. Previous experiments designed to examine the functional capacity of the A and B forms of the AR have been hampered by marked differences in the expression levels of the two isoforms, as the nucleotide sequence surrounding the codon encoding methionine- 188 causes it to be used inefficiently as a translation initiation site. To circumvent this, we altered the nucleotide sequence surrounding methionine- 188 to render it more similar to that surrounding the codon encoding methionine- 1. Transfection of a cDNA containing these changes resulted in similar levels of expression of A and B forms of the AR as assessed by immunoblot assays using antibodies directed at an epitope preserved in both. Functional activities of these cDNAs were assessed using cotransfection assays that employed two model androgen-responsive genes (MMTV-luciferase and PRE 2 -tk-luciferase) in response to <b>mibolerone,</b> a potent androgen agonist, in three different cell lines. These studies demonstrated subtle differences {{in the activities of}} the A and B isoforms, which depended on the promoter and cell context. Additional studies failed to reveal any major differences in the responses of the AR-A and AR-B isoforms to a variety of androgen agonists and antagonists, suggesting that the previously reported functional defect of the AR-A is due principally to its level of expression. When assays of AR function are performed under conditions in which levels of expression of the two isoforms are equivalent...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Leydig {{cells are}} {{a target for}} their own steroid product, testosterone, and thus could be subject to short-loop {{feedback}} regulation by androgens. The authors previously reported that 33 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase (3 HSD) activitywas higher in freshly isolated Leydig cells from C 57 BL/ 6 J than those from C 3 H/HeJ inbred mice. To determine whether this strain-related difference in 3 I 3 HSD activity could be mediated by differential sensitivity to feedback effects of testosterone, Leydig cells from the two strains were cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of testosterone, the synthetic androgen receptor agonist, <b>mibolerone,</b> or the nonaromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone. After 7 days of treatment, all three androgens significantly decreased 3 HSD activity in Leydig cells from C 57 BL/ 6 J, but not from C 3 H/HeJ mice. When Leydig cells were cultured with hydroxyflutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, the effect of testosterone was negated. To determine whether the strain-related difference in sensitivity to testosterone was mediated by a difference in the androgen receptor protein, Leydig cells from reciprocal Fl hybrid lines of mice were cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} testosterone. Testosterone treatment inhibited 3 HSD activity in both Fl lines to the same extent as observed for Leydig cells from C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Thus, there is a strain-related difference in the response to testosterone, but it cannot account for the strain-related difference in Leydig cell 313 HS 0 activity because the high 3 I 3 HSD strain (C 57 BL/ 6 J) is the sensitive strain. Although the effect on C 57 BL/ 6 J Leydig cells is androgen receptor-mediated, the dominant effect of testosterone on both Fl lines rules out a difference in the androgen receptor protein per se. However, the data are consistent with the difference being in a trans-acting factor distal to the androgen receptor...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} by which androgens intervene in the regulation of growth and differentiation of human prostatic epithelial cells, cDNA clones encoding putative prostate-secreted proteins were characterized and tested as potential markers for androgen action. One of the isolated cDNAs expressed diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein (DBI/ACBP), suggesting that this polypeptide, that has been implicated in {{a large number of}} biochemical processes, is expressed and secreted by prostate cells. As demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, the mRNA encoding DBI/ACBP was expressed in prostate tissue and in the three human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines tested: LNCaP, PC- 3 and DU- 145. In androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, the synthetic androgen R 1881 stimulated the DBI/ACBP steady state mRNA levels with half maximal effects at a concentration of 0. 2 nM. Increases were a maximal 12 h after addition of the synthetic hormone. DBI/ACBP mRNA levels could also be stimulated by the synthetic androgen <b>mibolerone</b> and by the natural androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In agreement with the altered steroid specificity of the androgen receptor in LNCaP cells, estradiol and progesterone also exerted a stimulatory effect. Cortisol and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone were without effect. Androgen stimulation of DBI/ACBP mRNA levels was abolished {{in the presence of the}} protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, implying a role for labile or androgen-induced proteins in this androgen stimulation. This is in contrast to the androgen stimulation of the mRNA encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA), suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in the androgen regulation of these two genes. Although further experiments are required to confirm that DBI/ACBP is secreted by prostatic epithelial cells, these data demonstrate that the mRNA encoding DBI/ACBP is expressed in prostate cells and is affected by androgens in androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: 5 alpha-reductase 1 (5 alphaR 1) and 5 alpha-reductase 2 (5 alphaR 2) convert {{testosterone}} {{into the}} more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone. 5 alphaR 2 is the main isoenzyme in normal prostate tissue; however, most prostate tumors have increased 5 alphaR 1 and decreased 5 alphaR 2 expression. Previously, finasteride (5 alphaR 2 inhibitor) treatment begun 3 weeks post-tumor implantation {{had no effect on}} Dunning R 3327 -H rat prostate tumor growth. We believe the tumor compensated for finasteride treatment by increasing tumor 5 alphaR 1 expression or activity. We hypothesize that finasteride treatment would not significantly alter tumor growth even if begun before tumor implantation, whereas dutasteride (5 alphaR 1 and 5 alphaR 2 inhibitor) treatment would decrease tumor growth regardless of whether treatment was initiated before or after tumor implantation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sixty 8 -week-old male nude mice were randomized to Control, Pre- and Post-Finasteride, and Pre- and Post-Dutasteride (83. 3 mg drug/kg diet) diet groups. Pre- and post-groups began their treatment diets 1 – 2 weeks prior to or 3 weeks after subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10 [5 th power] WPE 1 -NA 22 human prostate cancer cells, respectively. Tumors were allowed to grow for 22 weeks; tumor areas, body weights, and food intakes were measured weekly. At study’s conclusion, prostate and seminal vesicle weights were significantly decreased in all treatment groups versus the control; dutasteride intake significantly decreased seminal vesicle weights compared to finasteride intake. No differences were measured in final tumor areas or tumor weights between groups, likely due to poor tumor growth. In follow-up studies, proliferation of WPE 1 -NA 22 prostate cancer cells and parent line RWPE- 1 prostate epithelial cells were unaltered by treatment with testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or <b>mibolerone,</b> suggesting that these cell lines are not androgensensitive. Conclusion: The lack of response of WPE 1 -NA 22 prostate cancer cells to androgen treatment may explain the inadequate tumor growth observed. Additional studies are needed to determine whether finasteride and dutasteride are effective in decreasing prostate cancer development/growth...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} molecular basis of a "ligand-selective" mutant androgen receptor (AR) phenotype. Methyltrienelone (MT), a synthetic androgen, dissociates normally from this receptor but <b>mibolerone</b> (MB), another synthetic androgen, dissociates from it two-fold faster than normal. This mutant receptor was identified within genital skin fibroblasts (GSF) from two unrelated individuals with different degrees of androgen insensitivity (AI). Sequence analysis of the AR gene from both subjects revealed a G to A transition at nt 2969 in exon 6 that alters codon 813 from serine to asparagine (S 813 N). Transiently expressed hAR. S 813 N did not reproduce the mutant phenotype in several heterologous cells: COS- 1, BHK, CHO or HeLa cells. In contrast, when AR free (R$ sp-$) GSF were used as host cells, MB-R. S 813 N complexes dissociated almost two fold faster than the controls (n = 4) while MT-R. S 813 N complexes dissociated normally. These results establish the G to A transition at nt 2969 as the cause of the ligand-selective phenotype. Such host-cell restricted expression of the mutant dissociation rate points to cell-specific factors that can suppress abnormal dissociation of A-R complexes. Host cell-restricted expression of the abnormal dissociation rates has also been observed for two other transiently expressed mutant AR, hAR. V 865 L and hAR. R 839 H (n = 3). Expansion of the glutamine (gln) tract within the N-terminus of the AR causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a disease of motor neurons, but the mechanism of this neuropathology is unknown. To determine the effect of gln-tract expansion upon AR function, SBMA-associated mutant AR was transiently expressed and characterized in COS- 1 cells. The androgen-binding parameters of the mutant receptor were normal, but it had decreased transactivation competence (50 - 66 % of normal; n = 3). This abnormal transregulatory function may account for the expression of traits associated with minimal androgen insensitivity (MAI) that are variably expressed in the SBMA patients...|$|E
