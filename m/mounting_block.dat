500|$|While the {{building}} has a rough appearance today, the architecture is of a Palladian design. The upper floor consists of a hall and two reception rooms. On the eastern side, there was a third, timber-floored, level where the sleeping quarters were located. On the ground floor is a kitchen, servants' quarters and stairs to the upper floors. The entrance, {{which is on the}} upper floor, was reached by a long flight of stairs which is now missing. At each side of {{the building}} is a room with a lean-to roof which may have been used to stable horses. A stone <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> to assist people onto their horses can be seen on the eastern side. To the front there was a semi-circular courtyard, enclosed by a low stone wall and entered by a gate. The house faces to the north, looking over Dublin and the plains of Meath and Kildare, including Conolly's primary residence at Castletown House in Celbridge. The grounds around the lodge consisted of a [...] deer park. The identity of the architect is unknown: the author Michael Fewer has suggested it may have been Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733) who was employed by Conolly to carry out works at Castletown in 1724.|$|E

The 1801 hearse house adjacent to the Church Inn was listed grade II in 2012 as an important survival of a late Georgian hearse house with a design that is above the purely functional. Despite some later alterations, it retains many original features, including its stone sett floors and a timber ledger cupboard. There are a 1668 tomb crest and a medieval tomb slab with incised decoration built into the interior walls.

2500|$|The Fool {{leads the}} {{procession}} {{and has the}} right to kiss any woman on the way. Once at the green in front of Parish Church, at around 2:30pm, the Fool makes his traditional speech of welcome standing on an old <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> in front of the church known as the Mowbray Stone. During this speech a fire is lit with damp straw behind him. The smoke rises up and around him and this is known as ‘Smoking the Fool’. This is in fact a watered-down version of the earlier custom (abandoned {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century due to its obvious danger) in which a more substantial fire was lit with damp straw beneath a tree. The Fool was then suspended over the fire and swung back and forth until he was almost suffocated before being cut down and dropped into the fire, where he had to make his escape as best he could. At the end of the speech, the Fool finishes with the traditional words that the crowd chant along with him. They are: [...] "hoose agen hoose, toon agen toon, if a man meets a man knock 'im doon, but doan't 'ot 'im," [...] which translates as: [...] "house against house, town against town, if a man meets a man, knock him down but don’t hurt him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The listed {{buildings}} are clustered {{particularly in the}} town centre on Barker Street, Beam Street, Churchyard Side, High Street and Hospital Street, and extending across the Weaver on Welsh Row. The great majority are located within the [...] of conservation area, which broadly follows {{the boundaries of the}} late medieval and early post-medieval town. The oldest listed building is St Mary's Church, which dates from the 14th century and is listed at grade I. Two other listed {{buildings are}} known to pre-date the fire of 1583: Sweetbriar Hall and the grade-I-listed Churche's Mansion are both timber-framed, [...] "black and white" [...] Elizabethan mansion houses. A few years after the fire, William Camden described Nantwich as the [...] "best built town in the county", and particularly fine examples of timber-framed buildings constructed during the town's rebuilding include 46 High Street and the grade-I-listed Crown coaching inn. Many half-timbered buildings, such as 140–142 Hospital Street, have been concealed behind brick or render. The town contains many Georgian town houses; good examples include Dysart Buildings, 9 Mill Street, Townwell House and 83 Welsh Row. Several examples of Victorian corporate architecture are listed, including the former District Bank by Alfred Waterhouse. The most recent listed building is 1–5 Pillory Street, a curved corner block in 17th-century French style which dates from 1911. The majority of the town's listed buildings were originally residential; churches, chapels, public houses, schools, banks, almshouses and workhouses are also well represented. Unusual listed structures include a <b>mounting</b> <b>block,</b> twelve cast-iron bollards, a stone gateway, two garden walls and a summerhouse.|$|E
60|$|The Maypole--by which term from {{henceforth}} {{is meant}} the house, and not its sign--the Maypole {{was an old}} building, with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day; huge zig-zag chimneys, out of which {{it seemed as though}} even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes, imparted to it in its tortuous progress; and vast stables, gloomy, ruinous, and empty. The place was said to have been built in the days of King Henry the Eighth; and there was a legend, not only that Queen Elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion, to wit, in a certain oak-panelled room with a deep bay window, but that next morning, while standing on a <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> before the door with one foot in the stirrup, the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty. The matter-of-fact and doubtful folks, of whom there were a few among the Maypole customers, as unluckily there always are in every little community, were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal; but, whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> itself as evidence, and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day, the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority, and all true believers exulted as in a victory.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work is {{focussed}} on {{the numerical}} modeling of mixed convection heat transfer effects in a lid-driven cavity {{filled with a}} copper–water nanofluid. A heated wall <b>mounted</b> <b>block</b> with constant heat flux is attached along the vertical wall. The left vertical wall is maintained at higher temperature compared to the right vertical wall and the other (top and bottom) walls are insulated. A finite volume based numerical approach with QUICK scheme {{is used for the}} solution of nonlinear governing equations. A computational visualization technique is used to represent the two dimensional results of streamlines, isotherms, average Nusselt number and bulk-average temperature {{for a wide range of}} physical parameters, namely Reynolds number, Rayleigh number and solid volume fraction. The effective fluid flow and heat transfer variation are analyzed by placing the heated <b>mounted</b> <b>block</b> first along the left vertical wall (Case-I) and then along the right vertical wall (Case-II) to test the maximum heat transfer effects. The changes in main characteristics of the flow due to variation of Reynolds number and Rayleigh number are elaborated. The effect of various flow parameters on the thermal conductivity behavior for both cases is discussed based on average Nusselt number and bulk-average temperature and found that Case-I shows higher heat transfer rate compared to Case-II, for higher Re,Ra and ϕ...|$|R
