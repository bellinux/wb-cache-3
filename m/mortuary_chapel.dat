5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary Watts that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her time and money to the Watts <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Parish worship {{transferred}} to the new church, {{along with some of}} the fittings. The old church was thereafter used as a <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel</b> for a time. The churchyard continued to be used for burials until 1902. In modern times, the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church, and it is used by them as a private chapel. The churchyard is kept locked, but the church and the gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E
5|$|The Warren Family <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> is a stone chapel {{built on}} a knoll {{near the center of}} the cemetery. It was {{designed}} by Henry Dudley of New York City and built in 1860 in the English country Gothic style, complete with a nave and transept floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist Robert Walter Weir. Former member of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Mabbett Warren (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the figures}} {{involved}} with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866–1945), who was also influenced by Italian Renaissance art and French Symbolism. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects Tristan and Iseult (1912) and St Bride (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950). Duncan was {{a major contributor to}} Geddes' magazine The Evergreen. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced Robert Burns (1860–1941), E. A. Hornel (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).|$|E
50|$|Southern Cemetery {{originally}} occupied 40 acre of {{land that}} cost Manchester Corporation £38,340 in 1872. Its cemetery buildings were designed by architect H J Paull and its layout attributed to the city surveyor, James Gascoigne Lynde. The cemetery opened on 9 October 1879 and had <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> for Anglicans, Nonconformists, and Roman Catholics linked by an elliptical drive and a Jewish chapel at the west corner of the site. The original cemetery is registered by English Heritage in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its historic interest and the <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> and other structures are listed buildings.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery. A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, stood on the east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel</b> was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have stood on the crest of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E
5|$|Mary Watts died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic Watts near the Watts <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel,</b> {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.|$|E
50|$|While {{this was}} a {{cemetery}} for everyone, the most impressive funerary monuments are those grouped around the <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels,</b> where the local ‘great and the good’ purchased their grave plots. These illustrate a range of early twentieth century styles including Edwardian Italian marble angels and the Art Deco memorials of the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Rokeby made {{elaborate}} {{provision in}} his will for the disposal of his remains: he asked that his body should be buried in Halifax, but that his heart should be buried in St Oswald's Church, Kirk Sandall, and that <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> be erected at both spots. The Rokeby chapels in St Oswald's and Halifax Minster still exist.|$|R
50|$|Manchester Southern Cemetery {{originally}} {{occupied a}} 100 acre plot of land, {{in what was}} then Withington, that cost Manchester Corporation £38,340 in 1872.

The cemetery opened on 9 October 1879 and had <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> for Anglicans, Nonconformists, and Roman Catholics linked by an elliptical drive and a Jewish chapel at the west corner of the site. The original cemetery is registered by English Heritage in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its historic interest and the <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> and other structures are listed buildings. The site was expanded by the purchase of 90 acre {{on the opposite side of}} Nell Lane in 1926, the first section of which opened in 1943.

50|$|An {{award was}} given to E.C. Robbins, Arundel Street, the Strand, London, in October 1860 for the best design layout for the Queen's Road chapels. The design {{featured}} two <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels,</b> each having a simple nave with open timbered roof, and the Episcopal chapel having {{the addition of a}} semi-octagonal apse at the east end. The chapels are no longer in use for burial services.|$|R
50|$|The {{cemetery}} has {{a pair of}} Gothic style <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels,</b> both {{of which}} are Grade II listed buildings. The southern chapel was originally Anglican, and the northern non-conformist; they share a common porte-cochère. Currently, only the southern chapel is in use as an inter-faith place of worship. There is also an entry lodge made of Kentish Rag and Bath stone. The Heritage Lottery Fund has funded restoration work on the buildings.|$|R
25|$|The Howard <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel</b> in Lakeview Cemetery {{was built}} in 1882 {{as a gift to}} the City of Burlington from Hannah Louisa Howard, a local philanthropist.

The chapel was designed in the High Victorian Gothic style by Alfred Benjamin Fisher, on cemetery grounds designed by E. C. Ryer in 1871.|$|E
25|$|William Bernard, 12th Baron Petre (20 December 1817 – 4 July 1884) “a {{pattern of}} charity and piety”, was an {{enthusiastic}} builder of churches. To {{a greater or}} lesser extent, he was responsible for new churches in Brentwood, Chipping Ongar, Barking, Romford and Chelmsford and a <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel</b> (designed by William Wardell, a pupil of Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin) in the grounds of Thorndon Hall (dedicated on 11 September 1857, and used last for interment in 1965), as well as twice extending the chapel at Ingatestone Hall, which then served as parish church for the locality.|$|E
25|$|On 8 December 1904 the Italian crypt was shipped, in sixteen crates from Italy. It {{travelled}} on {{the same}} ship that the remains of Smithson travelled on. Architecture firm Hornblower & Marshall designed the <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel,</b> which included marble laurel wreaths and a neo-classical design. Smithson was entombed on 6 March 1905. His casket, which had been held in the Regent's Room, was placed into the ground underneath the crypt. This chapel was {{to serve as a}} temporary space for Smithson's remains until Congress approved a larger memorial. However, that never happened, and the remains of Smithson still lie there today.|$|E
50|$|The lodge, {{waiting room}} and <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> were {{designed}} by Sir Aston Webb and his son, Maurice. Maurice Webb was the architect for the crematorium, built in 1939 to meet a growing demand for cremations. It is situated in the cemetery grounds, ten acres of which were landscaped as memorial gardens. The crematorium is also a listed building and is notable for its beautiful stained glass window. By 1984 over 91,000 cremations had been conducted.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Fr. Severino Casas built two <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> in {{the church}} compound. Changes in 1983 {{included}} the lengthening of the nave {{and the removal of}} the choir loft above the main door, as well as the installation of the crucifix above a new altar. The retablo (reredos) was preserved, while the antique image of St. John the Baptist - which was previously at the top-centre of the retablo - was moved to the Saint Joseph Chapel.|$|R
5000|$|The church {{dates from}} the 12th century. <b>Mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> were added in about 1697 and in about 1712. The {{main part of the}} church was {{restored}} and virtually rebuilt in 1886 by Ewan Christian. A further restoration was carried out in 1902. [...] A lychgate was built {{at the entrance to the}} churchyard in about 1930. [...] The church was declared redundant on 1 June 1980, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 27 June 2006.|$|R
25|$|The present St Mary's Church {{is located}} in the centre of the small village of Clophill, between Bedford and Luton in the South Midlands of England. The new church, built in 1848, {{replaced}} the old church by order of the Church Commissioners in 1850. The old church building, formally The Church of St Mary The Virgin (shortened to The Church of St Mary) and known colloquially as Old St Mary's or The Old Parish Church, is {{at the edge of the}} village, and is estimated to be around 650 years old. It sits at the crest of the Greensand Ridge, offering views over the surrounding countryside. Its graveyard is a haven for wild flowers and wildlife. After the church moved to the village centre, incorporating various items from the old church building, the old building was converted for use as a <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel,</b> but in the 1950s it fell into ruin.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the initial}} three {{buildings}} {{constructed in the}} cemetery area, only one remains. The Church of England's Sexton's Cottage, a historic building built out of timber in 1857, was enlarged in 1885 and is now being restored. The public cemetery's Sexton's Cottage, also constructed of timber in 1857, was occupied by the sexton David Robertson and his family before the building was demolished in 1908; only its brick outlines are still viewable in the upper lawn. The <b>Mortuary</b> <b>Chapel,</b> built of timber in 1866, was left to deteriorate without any repairs and was finally demolished in 1969 {{to make way for}} the motorway. Based on recorded drawings of it, a replica chapel was built and serves as the visitor centre. Situated in the smaller half of the cemetery, it contains exhibits on the park's history, details of those buried at the cemetery, along with printed lists of names. A beehive centre is maintained by the Friends of Bolton Street Memorial Park who also facilitate information on conservation of the park's beehives.|$|E
500|$|Founded in 1698 by the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suárez and Fr. Dionosio Ávila, {{the mission}} of San José de Chiquitos was the third mission built of those of the World Heritage Site. At first, the mission was {{inhabited}} by the Penoca tribe. The church was built between 1745 and 1760 by an unknown architect. It is built of stone, unlike other mission churches in the area which were built with local adobe and wood. [...] The mission {{is one of four}} that remain in their original location. As of , a <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapel</b> (1740), the church (1747), a bell tower (1748), a house for the priests (colegio) and workshops (both 1754) still exist, and were renovated by Hans Roth's restoration project between 1988 and 2003. Restoration efforts continue.|$|E
50|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was designed}} and laid out by Garlick, Park and Sykes, architects of Preston. Originally there were three <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels,</b> Anglican, Catholic and Non-Conformist but only the Anglican remains. There was a lodge at the entrance which provided a residence and office for the custodian. The original part of the cemetery was surrounded a stone wall, topped with iron railings with a double iron gate at the entrance. These structures are extant. A World War I memorial is centrally situated.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is a large}} {{cemetery}} {{located in}} Bohermore known as the [...] "New Cemetery", which contains two <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels,</b> one Catholic and the other Protestant. People buried there include the Irish-language writer and journalist Pádraic Ó Conaire (1882-1928) Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce) (1906-1946), an Irish-American who broadcast Nazi propaganda from Germany during World War II, and Lady Gregory (1852-1932), {{a founding member of}} the Irish Literary Theatre Movement, who hosted a famous literary and artistic salon in her house at Coole Park, in rural south Galway, in its heyday.|$|R
50|$|The burial {{shaft and}} {{subsequent}} tunnel descend for 150 meters and {{end in a}} burial chamber 45 meters below the court. The chamber held a shrine, which once held the wooden coffin of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep. A great tree-lined court was reached {{by means of the}} processional causeway, leading up from the valley temple. Beneath the court, a deep shaft was cut which led to unfinished rooms believed to have been intended originally as the king’s tomb. A wrapped image of the pharaoh was discovered in this area by Howard Carter. The temple complex also held six <b>mortuary</b> <b>chapels</b> and shaft tombs built for the pharaoh's wives and daughters.|$|R
