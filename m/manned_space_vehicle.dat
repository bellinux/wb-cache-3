25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle,</b> with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E

By 1973, he became associate director, launch operations.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ejection}} escape system, {{sometimes called}} a [...] "launch escape system", had been discussed many {{times for the}} shuttle. After the Challenger and Columbia losses, great interest was expressed in this. All previous US <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> had launch escape systems, although none were ever used.|$|R

50|$|The Elbrus crew ejected a 28-kg amateur radio {{satellite}} from a Salyut 7 trash airlock on May 17, 1982. The Soviets {{called this}} the first launch of a communications satellite from a <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle.</b> They did this ahead of the launch of two large geostationary satellites from the U.S. Space Shuttle (STS-5, November 11-16, 1982).|$|E
50|$|Not {{only was}} this the first launch of the Space Shuttle, but it {{marked the first time}} that solid-fuel rockets were used for a NASA manned launch (although all of the Mercury and Apollo astronauts had relied on a solid-fuel motor in their escape towers and Mercury {{capsules}} had a solid-fueled retrorocket pack). STS-1 was also the first U.S. <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> launched without an unmanned powered test flight. The STS-1 orbiter, Columbia, also holds the record for {{the amount of time spent}} in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) before launch - 610 days, the time needed for the replacement of many of its heat shield tiles.|$|E
5000|$|The flight {{marked the}} first time an orbital <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> had been re-flown with a second crew. Prior to launch, Columbia spent 103 days in the Orbiter Processing Facility. It again carried the DFI package, as well as the OSTA-l payload (named for the NASA Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications), which {{consisted}} of a number of remote-sensing instruments mounted on a Spacelab pallet in the payload bay. These instruments, including the Shuttle Imaging Radar-A (SIR-A), successfully carried out remote sensing of Earth's resources, environmental quality, and ocean and weather conditions. In addition, the Canadian-built [...] "Canadarm" [...] Remote Manipulator System (RMS) was successfully operated in all its various operating modes for the first time.|$|E

50|$|The {{conversion}} of return delay time to geometric range {{can be very}} accurate because of the natural constancy of the speed and direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, for an aircraft flying through the never-uniform and never-quiescent atmosphere, the relating of pulse transmission and reception times to successive geometric positions of the antenna {{must be accompanied by}} constant adjusting of the return phases to account for sensed irregularities in the flight path. SAR's in spacecraft avoid that atmosphere problem, but still must make corrections for known antenna movements due to rotations of the spacecraft, even those that are reactions to movements of onboard machinery. Locating a SAR in a <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> may require that the humans carefully remain motionless relative to the vehicle during data collection periods.|$|E

5000|$|The Shuttle is {{the only}} winged manned {{spacecraft}} to have achieved orbit and landing, and the only reusable <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> that has ever made multiple flights into orbit (the Russian shuttle Buran was very similar and was designed {{to have the same}} capabilities but made only one unmanned spaceflight before it was cancelled). Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments {{to be added to the}} International Space Station (ISS)), providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions. The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads (e.g., from the ISS) from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years operational life, though original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches and over a 15-year operational span with a launch per month expected at the peak of the program, but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station [...] never created such a peak demand for frequent flights.|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{information on the}} shielding of <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> against protons and alpha particles is summarized. The {{emphasis is placed on}} shielding against Van Allen belt protons and against solar-flare protons and alpha particles, but information on shielding against galactic cosmic rays is also presented. The approximation methods for use by nonexperts in the space shielding field are those that are standard in the space shielding literature...|$|R
50|$|By {{the first}} quarter of 2009, Roskosmos had {{finalized}} its requirements for the next-generation manned spacecraft and had received proposals from both RKK Energia and Khrunichev enterprise. This was the actual beginning of the PPTS project. The agency was finally ready to name the prime developer of the vehicle. Formally, only two organizations which were practically capable of developing <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> competed in the government tender to build the new spacecraft—RKK Energia in Korolev and Moscow-based Khrunichev enterprise.|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} data base identifying over 800 fluids and materials processing experiments {{performed in a}} low-gravity environment has been created at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The compilation, called MICREX (MICrogravity Research Experiments) was designed to document all such experimental efforts performed (1) on U. S. <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles,</b> (2) on payloads deployed from U. S. <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and (3) on all domestic and international sounding rockets (excluding those of China and the former U. S. S. R.).

This technical memorandum (1) summarizes the historical interest in reduced-gravity fluid dynamics, (2) describes {{the importance of a}} low-gravity fluids and materials processing data base, (4) describes thE MICREX data base format and computational World Wide Web access procedures, and (5) documents (in hard-copy form) the descriptions of the first 600 fluids and materials processing experiments entered into MICREX...|$|R
5000|$|Although the Orion {{spacecraft}} is oriented towards deep-space missions such as NEO visitation, it {{can also}} be used retrieve crew or supplies from the ISS if that task is needed once the spacecraft is operational. However, it is expected that the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program will produce a functioning <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> as early as 2018, providing an alternative to Orion or Soyuz. The delay is longer than expected because the Ares I was cancelled in 2010, leaving little time before the STS retired for something new to be ready for flight. [...] U.S. Congress was aware a spaceflight gap could occur and accelerated funding in 2008 and 2009 in preparation for the retirement of the Shuttle. At that time the first crewed flight of the planned Ares I launcher would not have occurred until 2015, and its first use at ISS until 2016. Another option that has been analyzed is to adapt Orion to a man-rated heavy launch vehicle like the Delta IV Heavy. (see also Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle) Another spacecraft evaluated by NASA, and also for commercial crew, was the ATK Liberty rocket, which looked similar to Ares I and was based on STS (SRB) and Ariane 5 (Second stage) components.|$|E
40|$|The {{engineering}} design, development, breadboard fabrication, test, {{and delivery}} of a breadboard field sequential color video to parallel color video converter is described.

Flight simulations show the PLS {{to be a very}} flyable vehicle with very little control and propellant expenditure required during entry. The attention to crew safety has resulted in the design of a system that provides protection for the crew throughout the mission profile. However, a new operations philosophy for <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> must be adopted to fully achieve low-cost, manned earth-to-orbit transportation...|$|R
40|$|Dosimetric {{implications}} for manned space flight are evaluated {{by analyzing the}} radiation field behind the heavy shielding of a <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> on a near-earth orbital mission and how it compares with actual exposure levels recorded on Apollo missions.

40|$|Less toxic, storable, hypergolic {{propellants}} are {{desired to}} replace nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine in certain applications. Hydrogen peroxide {{is a very}} attractive replacement oxidizer, but finding acceptable replacement fuels is more challenging. The focus of this investigation is to find fuels that have short hypergolic ignition delays, high specific impulse, and desirable storage properties. The resulting hypergolic fuel/oxidizer combination would be highly desirable for virtually any high energy-density applications such as small but powerful gas generating systems, attitude control motors, or main propulsion. These systems would be implemented on platforms ranging from guided bombs to replacement of environmentally unfriendly existing systems to <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Space Transportation System (STS), {{also known}} {{internally}} to NASA as the Integrated Program Plan (IPP), was a proposed system of reusable <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> envisioned in 1969 to support extended operations beyond the Apollo program. (NASA appropriated {{the name for}} its Space Shuttle Program, the only component of the proposal to survive Congressional funding approval.) The purpose of the system was twofold: {{to reduce the cost}} of spaceflight by replacing the current method of launching capsules on expendable rockets with reusable spacecraft; and to support ambitious follow-on programs including permanent orbiting space stations around the Earth and Moon, and a human landing mission to Mars.|$|R
40|$|Viewgraphs {{on space}} {{radiation}} protection are presented.

40|$|The {{presence}} of failures in navigation sensors {{can cause the}} determination of an erroneous aircraft state estimate, which includes position, attitude, and their derivatives. Aircraft flight control systems rely on sensor inputs to determine the aircraft state. In the case of integrated Inertial/NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), sensor failures could occur in the on-board inertial sensors or in the GPS measurements. The synergistic use of both GPS and the Inertial Navigation System (INS) allows for highly reliable fault detection and isolation of sensor failures. Integrated Inertial/GPS is a promising technology for the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) and the return and landing of a <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E

50|$|During the Cold War, Nedelin {{inadvertently}} {{played a}} key role in ushering in the Space Age by concluding that rockets were the ideal means to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States instead of bombers, and ordered Sergei Korolev to develop the massive R-7 ICBM capable of carrying a large warhead to the United States. This rocket and its derivatives, while never an effective ICBM, was powerful enough to launch Sputnik, the world's first artificial Earth satellite, and then Vostok <b>manned</b> <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> into orbit. These accomplishment allowed the Soviet Union to beat the United States on being the first nation to enter space, and taking a leading position during the early Space Race.|$|R
