40|$|The {{exploitation}} of mixed cultures for the dark fermentation of hydrolysates of lignocellulosic biomass is hindered by low hydrogen yields {{due to the}} presence of inhibitors of bacterial growth (phenols, furans) and to proliferation of bacteria not involved in the production of hydrogen (e. g. lactic acid bacteria) or consuming hydrogen (methanogens, acetogens). Initially, a non-methanogenic anaerobic consortium has been tested for the the dark fermentation of a synthetic medium with glucose as sole carbon source (yields average at 0. 66 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose). The effect of single inhibitors (p-coumaric acid, furfural) added to the synthetic medium has been evaluated in terms of hydrogen yields and kinetics. 0. 2 g/L of p-coumaric acid limited both kinetics and yield of H 2 production (dropping to 0. 16 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose), whereas 2. 0 g/L furfural prolonged the lag phase of about one day without significantly affecting the overall yield.

40|$|Ph. D., Faculty of Science, University of the Wiwatersrand, 2011 Biological {{production}} of hydrogen gas has received increasing interest {{from the international}} community during the last decade. Most studies on biological fermentative hydrogen production from carbohydrates using mixed cultures have been conducted in conventional continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) under mesophilic conditions. Investigations on hydrogen production in reactor systems with attached or self-immobilized microbial growth have also appeared recently in the literature. These investigations on attached or self-immobilised bacteria involve hydrogen production in the mesophilic and thermophilic temperature range. The present study investigated the design and operational features of anaerobic fluidized granular bed bioreactor (AFGB) system which would facilitate the simultaneous achievement of high productivities (HPs) and high hydrogen yields (HYs). Where high HPs is greater than 120 mmol H 2 /(L. h) and HYs greater than 4 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose. Theoretical maximum yield for an exponentially growing non-granulated bacterial monoculture will always be less than the thermodynamic maximum of 4 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO- + 4 H 2 + 4 H+ + 2 HCO 3. The design features included reducing the total non-working or dead volume of bioreactor system. The operational improvements included application of thermophilic temperatures and high rates of de-gassed effluent recycling through the fluidized granular bed. An example of an optimal ratio of effluent recycle rate (R) to bioreactor working volume (V) was (3. 0 L/min) /(3. 2 L/min) = 0. 94 minutes. Under conditions where temperatures were maximised and V/R were minimized the HPs increased to 21. 58 L H 2 /h. Also under these conditions the HYs increased above 3. 0 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose. Specific hydrogen productivity for the fluidized granular bed increased from 0. 25 L H 2 / (g BM. h) or 8. 83 mmol H 2 / (g BM. h) at 45 oC to 0. 525 L H 2 / (g BM. h) or 18. 03 mmol H 2 / (g BM. h) at 70 oC.

Ranges for IDS protein in control samples were 25. 8 – 153 g/L for blood spots and 22. 8 – 349. 4 g/L for plasma. Conclusion: Measurement of the IDS protein concen-tration and enzyme activity (as measured by a simple fluorogenic assay with an immune capture technique) enables identification {{of the majority of}} MPS II patient samples from both dried blood spots and plasma samples...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{hydrogen}} production using renewable resources is a promising possibility to generate hydrogen in a sustainable way. In this study, a sequential dark and photofermentation has been employed for bio{{hydrogen production}} using {{sugar beet molasses}} as a feedstock. An extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus {{was used for the}} dark fermentation, and several photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodobacter capsulatus wild type, R. capsulatus hup- mutant, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) were used for the photofermentation. C. saccharolyticus was grown in a pH-controlled bioreactor, in batch mode, on molasses with an initial sucrose concentration of 15 g/L. The influence of additions of NH 4 + and yeast extract on sucrose consumption and hydrogen production was determined. The highest hydrogen yield (4. 2 <b>mol</b> of <b>H</b> 2 /mol sucrose) and maximum volumetric productivity (7. 1 mmol H 2 /Lc. h) were obtained in the absence of NH 4 +. The effluent of the dark fermentation containing no NH 4 + was fed to a photobioreactor, and hydrogen production was monitored under continuous illumination, in batch mode. Productivity and yield were improved by dilution of the dark fermentor effluent (DFE) and the additions of buffer, iron-citrate and sodium molybdate. The highest hydrogen yield (58 % of the theoretical hydrogen yield of the consumed organic acids) and productivity (1. 37 mmol H 2 /Lc. h) were attained using the hup- mutant of R. capsulatus. The overall hydrogen yield from sucrose increased from the maximum of 4. 2 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol sucrose in dark fermentation to 13. 7 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol sucrose (corresponding to 57 % of the theoretical yield of 24 <b>mol</b> of <b>H</b> 2 /mole of sucrose) by sequential dark and photofermentation...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{fermentation process}} consisting of dark and photo-fermentation periods {{was carried out}} in a batch reactor. In the first stage, glucose was fermented in the dark stage using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 (ATCC 13564; CSN 1 - 4) to produce acetate, CO 2 and H 2. The acetate produced in the first stage is fermented to H 2 and CO 2 by Rhodobacter sphaeroides NCIMB 8253 for further hydrogen production in the second, illuminated stage. The yield of hydrogen in the first stage was about 3. 10 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 (<b>mol</b> glucose) - 1 at a glucose concentration of 10 g L - 1, pH 6 ± 0. 2 and 37 °C and the second stage yield was about 1. 10 - 1. 25 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 (<b>mol</b> acetic acid) - 1 at pH 6. 8 ± 0. 2 and 32 °C, without removal of the Clostridium CSN 1 - 4.

40|$|Biohydrogen (bio-H 2) is a {{possible}} future alternative energy source. Hydrogen (H 2) derived from cheap agriculture feedstocks is a necessary requirement for economical full-scale production. Solubilizing cellulose, hemicellulose and other organic components in low value feedstocks is accomplished by processes such as acid treatment or steam explosion. During pretreatment, microbial inhibitors such as furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) are generated from hexose and pentose sugars. A commercially available ion-exchange resin (XAD- 4) {{was used to remove}} furan inhibitors from liquor derived from pretreating low value agriculture residues. A surface response model was used to predict inhibitor concentrations after 360 minutes of treatment. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the impact of treating switchgrass liquor with XAD- 4 resin on the H 2 yield. Treated and untreated switchgrass liquor generated maximum yields of 2. 25 ± 0. 14 and 1. 80 ± 0. 11 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose, respectively. In comparison, a yield of 2. 14 ± 0. 21 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 /mol glucose was detected in cultures fed pure glucose...|$|R
40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} mechanism {{during the}} incubation period in nanocrystalline MgH 2 (low alpha: converted metal fraction and d alpha/dt) {{and the reasons}} for the occurrence of the incubation period at 320, 350, and 400 degrees C were investigated. Pre-existing Mg crystallites can enhance Mg nucleation during the incubation period, as suggested by the estimated activation energy for nucleation (12 +/- 2 kJ per <b>mol</b> <b>H).</b> The released H-atoms enter MgH 2 as interstitials, as indicated by the MgH 2 unit-cell contraction, resulting in increased equatorial Mg-H bond length, decreased charge-density distribution in the interstitial region, as observed from the charge-density maps, and decreased H-H distance in the { 001 } plane up to the midway of the incubation period. Eventually, hydrogen vacancies are created, as indicated by the red shift in the E-g and A(lg) peaks of Raman spectra. The high estimated activation energy for the growth of Mg (209 +/- 8 kJ per <b>mol</b> <b>H)</b> renders it difficult and explains the reason for the presence of an incubation period...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this work was to study the feasibility of biohydrogen production by heat-treated anaerobic sludge with glucose as carbon substrate and ammonium as nitrogen source, obtained from the electrochemical reduction of concentrated nitrate solutions (3 g L− 1 NO 3 −NO 3 −), namely model solutions simulating those obtained after physicochemical denitrification of industrial wastewaters. Experiments were realized in bacth systems involving 125 mL (without pH control) and 3 L (with pH control) reactor, respectively. In order to find the optimal conditions for H 2 production, {{the first set of}} experiments were conducted without pH control at various initial pH (pH 5. 5, 6. 5 and 7. 5) and glucose concentrations (5 – 30 g L− 1); and the highest H 2 yield (1. 1 <b>mol</b> <b>H</b> 2 View the MathML sourcemol− 1 glucoseconsumed) was reached for a glucose concentration of 25 g L− 1 and at pH 6. 5.
