A sub-group of mussels was inoculated with Vibrio anguillarum and exposed to the same conditions as above. After the exposure period, mussels were collected to assess hemocyte count and viability, immunocompetence (phagocytosis and nitrite production), oxidative stress/inflammation (cyclooxygenase and lipid peroxidation) and oxygen radical/xenobiotic scavenging activity (metallothioniens, glutathione S-transferase). The results showed that mussels exposed to <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent</b> had increased hemocyte counts, phagocytosis, nitrites, lipid peroxidation and metallothioneins. In the inoculated mussels, the same responses were observed, in addition to cyclooxygenase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Multivariate analyses revealed that (1) the response pattern changed with effluent concentration, where increased responses observed at low effluent concentrations (> 10 %, V/V) were attenuated at higher effluent concentrations, (2) the effluent produced more pronounced changes in lipid peroxidation, metallothionein and hemocyte viability, and (3) the simultaneous presence of V. anguillarum led to more important changes in hemocyte count and viability and nitrite levels.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the sex ratio, vitellogenin (Vtg) -like proteins, serotonin, arachidonate cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and dopamine status in wild mussels living at sites upstream and downstream of two municipal effluent outfalls in the Mille-Îles River (Quebec, Canada). Gonad integrity was also studied by monitoring the gonado-somatic index (GSI), the {{activity of}} the rate-limiting enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC) for purine synthesis, and changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO). The results showed that the proportion of females was dramatically increased from 30 % at the upstream sites to 80 % at the downstream sites. The levels of Vtg-like proteins were significantly elevated in the male mussels only. Male mussels downstream of the municipal effluent plumes expressed female-specific protein bands (Vtg-like), as determined by high-resolution gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The serotonin/dopamine ratio was significantly decreased in the downstream mussels, indicating that the gonad was in a state of early vitellogenesis. However, this change was not accompanied by changes in ATC, suggesting no significant egg production was underway; this was confirmed by the observation that the downstream mussels displayed significantly low GSIs. GSIs were rather dependent on the serotonin/dopamine ratio (r= 0. 44; p< 0. 001), while Vtg-like proteins were dependent on dopamine levels (r= 0. 50; p< 0. 001). The increase in COX activity at the downstream sites and its close relationship with increased serotonin levels suggest a concomitant serotonergic signalling in addition to VTG production. The production of Vtg-like proteins combined with the serotonergic effects of the <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> was associated with oxidative damage (LPO) in the gonad.

In the St. Lawrence River, male fish living {{downstream from}} Montreal exhibit increased hepatic vitellogenin, intersex, delayed spermatogenesis and altered immune function. Few {{studies have examined}} genome-wide effects associated with <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent</b> exposure in fish to decipher the mechanisms of toxicity. The present objective was to identify hepatic cellular signaling pathways in fathead minnows following exposure to <b>municipal</b> wastewater <b>effluent.</b> Immature minnows were exposed for 21 days to either 0 % (Control) or 20 % <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent,</b> the highest concentration in the St. Lawrence River. Hepatic RNA was extracted and used to hybridize a fathead minnow oligonucleotide microarray containing approximately 15 k gene sequences. A total of 1300 genes were differentially expressed, of which 309 genes had more than 2 -fold change in expression level between control and MWWE-exposed fish. Of those, 118 were up-regulated and 191 were down-regulated. Altered genes grouped according to function, indicated effects on various signaling pathways, apoptosis, immune responses, and cellular metabolism. Pathway analysis software predicted at least 5 signaling pathways that were altered by treatment: cell adhesion, inflammation, various kinases, estrogen receptor signaling and WNT signaling. Various components of the canonical Wnt pathway were dramatically down-regulated, while several other genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt pathway, such as Wnt 4, LRP 6, and PPP 2 R 5 E, which are known to inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway, were increased.

40|$|The marine {{environment}} of Pakistan {{has been described}} {{in the context of}} three main regions : the Indus delta and its creek system, the Karachi coastal region, and the Balochistan coast. The creeks, contrary to concerns, do receive adequate discharges of freshwater. On site observations indicate that freshwater continues flowing into them during the lean water periods and dilutes the seawater there. A major factor for the loss of mangrove forests as well as ecological disturbances in the Indus delta is loss of the silt load resulting in erosion of its mudflats. The ecological disturbance has been aggravated by allowing camels to browse the mangroves. The tree branches and trunks, having been denuded of leaves are felled for firewood. Evidence is presented to show that while indiscriminate removal of its mangrove trees is responsible for the loss of large tracts of mangrove forests, overharvesting of fisheries resources has depleted the river of some valuable fishes that were available from the delta area. Municipal and industrial effluents discharged into the Lyari and Malir rivers and responsible for land-based pollution at the Karachi coast and the harbour. The following are the three major areas receiving land-based pollution and whose environmental conditions have been examined in detail: (l) the Manora channel, located on the estuary of the Lyari river and serving as the main harbour, has vast areas forming its western and eastern backwaters characterized by mud flats and mangroves. The discharge of industrial wastewater from the S. I. T. E. and <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> from the northern and central districts into the Lyari has turned this river into an open drain. This, in turn, has caused a negative impact on the environment of the port, fish harbour, and the adjacent beaches. (2) The Gizri creek receives industrial and <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> from the Malir river as well as from several industries and power stations. The highly degraded discharges from the Malir have negatively impacted the environment in this creek. (3) The coastline between the Manora channel and Gizri creek where the untreated <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> are discharged by the southern districts of Karachi, is responsible for the degraded environment of the Chinna creek, and also of the beaches and the harbour.

40|$|Assessments of {{nutrient}} enrichment and contaminant toxicity from treated <b>municipal</b> sewage <b>effluent</b> {{were conducted on}} biota from the South Saskatchewan River through field monitoring and artificial stream experimentation. Field studies indicated that primary productivity was stimulated by {{nutrient enrichment}}, however, standing crop measurements were strongly influenced by increased abundance of invertebrates (i. e., chironomids). Periphyton quality was adversely effected by contaminants in the effluent, resulting in reduced lipid energy storage and physiological condition. Invertebrate community structure and composition at sampling stations were assessed {{through the use of}} diversity and similarity indices. Diversity indices were successful in identifying changes in community structure immediately downstream of the <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent</b> discharge, whereas the similarity index indicated a 51 % difference in community composition between upstream and downstream sites. The evaluation of ecosystem processes based on invertebrate functional feeding groups were used to assess the influence of <b>municipal</b> sewage <b>effluent</b> on energy flow within the river. Energy storage within each group was measured by both biomass and areal lipid content. The identification of increased biomass and areal lipid content of gatherers and filter feeders immediately downstream of the effluent discharge suggests organic enrichment effects, whereas a reduction in scraper and predator biomass and lipid content indicated organic enrichment and toxicological effects. Measurements of invertebrate functional feeding groups provided descriptive, and ecologically meaningful information. When combined with the descriptive power of multivariate analyses, functional feeding group data was useful as a rapid bioassessment approach in the evaluation of effluent impacts on river ecosystems. Artificial stream studies were conducted to address questions on chronic effluent toxicity, and possible nutrient-toxicant interactions on growth and energy storage of the common stream scraper, Baetis tricaudatis. Larvae exposed to effluent had a 100 % increase in thorax length over control animals, indicating growth stimulation of effluent exposed animals. Measurements of dry weight showed no effects of effluent on B. tricaudatis, however food effects were significantly different indicating that appropriate food levels were selected. Baetis tricaudatis exposed to 1 % and 10 % <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent</b> concentrations were found to have reduced lipid energy storage, indicating a reduction in physiological status. With increased food availability, the level of lipid energy storage increased to those of control animals, however, this was only apparent at the 1 % effluent concentration, suggesting that at 10 % effluent concentrations, food quantity can not alleviate effects. From a bioassessment perspective, this research provides important information on alternative methods for evaluating effluent impacts on river ecosystems.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the short-term effects of tertiary-treated <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> on the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Caged mussels were immersed during 2 weeks in a river located North of Montreal Island, upstream/downstream the outfall and in one reference site located at the beginning of the Rivière des Prairies. A selection of biomarkers was analyzed to depict changes on various physiological systems: general physiology (mussel viability, condition index and gonado-somatic index), immune status (hemocyte viability, cellularity, phagocytosis efficiency, NK-like cytotoxic activity and lysozyme activity), inflammation (cyclo-oxygenase activity), detoxification (glutathione-S-transferases activity) and vitellogenesis (alkali-labile phosphate level). The analysis of total and fecal coliform counts in water and of heterotrophic bacteria levels in mussel tissues showed that the bacteriological quality of the water strongly decreased from the reference site to the downstream site. This was correlated with a significant loss of weight and an increase of mussel mortality. Cellularity and phagocytosis efficiency were significantly increased in the downstream site compared to the reference site. Though not statistically significant, lysozyme activity was also increased. NK-like cytotoxicity, activity of the pro-inflammatory enzyme COX and the levels of ALP and MT were not significantly changed. Conversely, the <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> induced a significant increase of GST activity in downstream site, indicating a stimulation of detoxification metabolism.

The experimental design was a split-plot with three irrigation sources (namely raw sewage, 50 % diluted sewage and well water) as main-treatment and four combinations of Mn and Zn foliar spraying as sub-treatments, which were applied with three replications. The experiment was conducted at the Zabol University research farm during 2009. The applied <b>municipal</b> <b>effluents</b> contained higher levels of macro and micro-nutrients than the well water. The experimental results indicated that irrigation of plants by raw or diluted sewage improved the measured growth parameters and productivity of foxtail millet plants. In addition macro and micro-nutrients concentrations were improved. These improvements were attributed to the presence of high levels of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matters in wastewater. Manganese and Zn supplied through sewage water alone were not able to raise the productivity of millet to the level obtained through fertilizers at the recommended level, which indicated that additional nutrients through fertilizers are required to obtain higher productivity of millet under sewage farming. Despite the differences in nutrients concentration among different irrigation water sources, the micro-nutrients foliar spray did not affect concentration of macro and micro-nutrients in foxtail millet plant. Overall, the results suggest that municipal sewage could be efficiently utilized as an important source of water and nutrients in growing foxtail millet Sewage water irrigation did not have any appreciable harmful effect on crop productivity...|$|E

Their effects were then compared with a treated municipal effluent known for its contamination, {{and its effects on}} the immune response of Lymnaea stagnalis. Adult L. stagnalis were exposed for 3 days to an environmentally relevant concentration of the four mixtures individually and as a global mixture. Effects on immunocompetence (hemocyte viability and count, ROS and thiol levels, phagocytosis) and gene expression were related to the immune response and oxidative stress: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), two isoforms of the nitric oxide synthetase gene (NOS 1 and NOS 2), molluscan defensive molecule (MDM), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), allograft inflammatory factor- 1 (AIF) and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70). Immunocompetence was differently affected by the therapeutic class mixtures compared to the global mixture, which increased hemocyte count, ROS levels and phagocytosis, and decreased intracellular thiol levels. TLR 4 gene expression was the most strongly increased, especially by psychiatric mixture (19 -fold), while AIF- 1, GR and CAT genes were downregulated.

Chronic low-level exposure to arsenic {{has been found to}} increase health risks for cancer, skin lesions, and numerous other illnesses. In January 2006, the Environmental Protectio...|$|R

Questions remain as to how accurately these controlled toxicity tests predict sitespecific bioavailability and effects of metals. Concurrent 42 -day Hyalella azteca exposures were performed with cadmium and final treated <b>municipal</b> <b>effluent</b> in the laboratory and at the University of North Texas Stream Research Facility. Further laboratory testing in reconstituted hard water was also conducted. Endpoints evaluated include survival, growth, reproduction, and Cd body burden. My results demonstrate that laboratory toxicity tests may overestimate toxicity responses to cadmium when compared to effluent dominated stream exposures. Discrepancies between endpoints in the three tests likely resulted from increased food sources and decreased cadmium bioavailability in stream mesocosm...|$|R
