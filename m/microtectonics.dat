40|$|New {{geophysical}} {{data and}} geological observations {{emphasize the importance}} of brittle tectonics in the Neogene to present day evolution of the Western Alps. The oldest Neogene stress state (F 1) is characterized by extension direction parallel to the orogen and shortening direction vertical or perpendicular to the Alpine belt whereas the youngest tectonic event (F 2) is characterized by brittle extension perpendicular to the mountain belt. According to new brittle <b>microtectonics</b> data from the High Maurienne valley near Modane and a synthesis of the available geochronological and <b>microtectonics</b> data at the scale of the internal Alps, we discuss a timing of the brittle tectonics phases and their role in the formation of basement domes (Internal Crystalline massifs and Briançonnais domes). We propose that the F 1 event spans from 32 - 30 Ma to 22 Ma south of the Simplon fault and was probably active up to 5 Ma on the Simplon fault. The F 2 event started at about 6 - 5 Ma and is still active. In this scheme, basement domes observed in the Western Alps are the results of interference between an early E-W extension along NE-SW ductile to brittle faults and the two F 1 -F 2 brittle tectonic events documented here...|$|E

30|$|In summary, the micropetrographic {{analysis}} of the studied coal samples from the Kladno–Rakovník Basin revealed the low thermal and oxidative alteration corresponding to rather lower temperatures. The reflectance Rr of the samples studied was 0.65 %– 0.69 %, which corresponds well to those determined for the coal of the Kladno–Rakovník Basin by Pešek and Sýkorová (2006), Rr[*]=[*] 0.60 %– 0.75 %, also involving altered samples. Regarding the microthermometric measurements of fluid inclusions (Zachariáš and Pešek 2011), coal was altered at temperatures corresponding to the temperatures of carbonate fluids; at these temperatures, mylonite and microbreccia phenomena occurred. These <b>microtectonics</b> phenomena are probably of hydrothermal origin and were generated by the thermally driven circulation of fluids {{in the vicinity of}} an intrusive from an obscured volcanic center. As a result, the thermally and oxidatively altered coal was formed, because a higher porosity of coal occurred allowing the transport of oxygen through the pores and the reaction of O 2 with active sites on the pore surfaces. Subsequently, after fluid cooling, crystallization and the formation of the observed carbonate veins and veinlets occurred. These veins and veinlets could have formed after maximum burial.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the way {{fracture}} networks {{evolve in}} space and time in low-permeability rocks is required in several applied problems. The turbiditic system of the SE Basin of France is associated with injectites that constitute markers of early deformation in the Blue Marls formation. It thus offers a unique opportunity to characterize the onset dynamics and evolution through time of such a 3 D fracture network into low permeability rocks. This study explores the relative timing between (i) Blue Marls deposition, (ii) hostrock deformation, (iii) sand injection into fractures and (iv) regional changes in paleostresses, thanks to both <b>microtectonics</b> and magnetic fabric (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) analyses in both the hostrock and injectites. These two coupled studies put forward that the hostrock was submitted to a N 150 -N 160 layer parallel shortening which was not recorded or preserved by injectites. Injection, probably triggered in several pulses, was synchronous with a N/S compression responsible for strike-slip faulting in the study area. This compression persisted after cementation of injections triggered by the first pulse.

30|$|The studied coals samples (K 1 –K 11, Table  3) are high-volatile {{bituminous}} in rank, with variable mineralization {{and high}} vitrinite, variable inertinite and low liptinite contents, while the reflectance Rr varies between 0.65 % and 0.69 %. The {{collection of samples}} comprises three samples of unaltered coal (K 1 –K 3), four samples of altered coal (K 4 –K 7) and four samples of altered coal with mylonite structures and microbreccia (K 8 –K 11). Unaltered coals show as their typical features a dominant content of vitrinite, high content of inertinite and low content of minerals (carbonates). The alteration of the coal organic mass is manifested by the weaker intensity of the fluorescence of liptinite macerals (Stach et al. 1982; Pickel et al. 2017).

At the granite contact, hosting micaschists present low-dip foliation. Early pegmatitic sills are crosscut by high-angle Boborás granitic sills and dykes which are frequently bordered by late Au-As-bearing quartz shear veins. Associated vertical ¸Sen echelonˇT tension gashes filled by Au-bearing arsenopyrite and quartz are also observed.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} development of the Paleoproterozoic Buganda-Toro belt in the Rwenzori mountains and its influence on {{the western part of the}} East African Rift System in Uganda. The Buganda-Toro belt is composed of several thick-skinned nappes consisting of Archaean Gneisses and Palaeoproterozoic cover units that are thrusted northwards. The high Rwenzori mountains are located in the frontal unit of this belt with retrograde greenschist facies gneisses towards the north, which are unconformably overlain by metasediments and amphibolites. Towards the south the metasediments are overthrust by the next migmatitic gneiss unit that belongs to a crustal scale nappe. The southwards dipping metasedimentary and volcanic sequence in the high Rwenzori mountains shows an inverse metamorphic grade with greenschist facies conditions in the north and amphibolite facies conditions in the south. Early D 1 deformation structures are overgrown by cordierite, which in turn grows into D 2 deformation, representing the major northwards directed thrusting event. We argue that the inverse metamorphic gradient develops because higher grade rocks are exhumed in the footwall of a crustal scale nappe whereas the exhumation decreases towards the north away from the nappe leading to a decrease in metamorphic grade. The D 2 deformation event is followed by a D 3 E-W compression, a D 4 with {{the development of}} steep shear zones with a NNE-SSW and SSE-NNW trend including the large Nyamwamba shear followed by a local D 5 retrograde event and D 6 brittle inverse faulting. The Paleoproterozoic Buganda-Toro belt is relatively stiff and crosses the NNE-SSW running rift system exactly at the node where the highest peaks of the Rwenzori mountains are situated and where the lake George rift terminates towards the north. Orientation of brittle and ductile fabrics show some similarities indicating that the cross-cutting Buganda-Toro belt influenced rift propagation and brittle fault development within the Rwenzori mountain and that this stiff belt may form part of the reason why the Rwenzori mountains are relatively high within the rift.

ABSTRACT: Natural fracturing includes all the mechanical discontinuities affecting the rock matrix. These natural fractures usually constitute preferential drains or permeability barriers which partially control the movement of fluids during production. The fracturing map of the Calcareous Dorsale in the Northern Rif was established using remote sensing (photo-interpretation) and GIS techniques, as well as field measurements of fractures randomly distributed in six <b>microtectonic</b> stations. Firstly, using the above mentioned approaches the main sets of fractures are detected. The dominant direction of fractures corresponds to the NE-SW direction which also coincides with the dominant orientation of the hydrographic network. Thus, the results from these two methodological approaches permit {{the development of a}} hypothetical scenario of karst groundwater circulations between the different units of the study area and other nearby units...|$|R

40|$|We {{synthesize}} available structural, seismotectonics and <b>microtectonics</b> studies, mechanical modelling of {{the topography}} {{as well as}} stratigraphic constraints on the timing of Plio-Pleistocene folding and Zagros basin evolution {{in order to examine}} which mechanical behaviour would explain the development of the Zagros Folded Belt at both local and regional scale. At the local scale we focus on the mechanism of cover folding and internal deformation of cover rocks. At the regional scale we focus on crustal rheology that led to the observed regional topography. Recent mechanical constraints derived from a critical wedge modelling of the regional topography together with available structural studies and seismotectonic studies confirm that the basement is necessarily involved in the deformation. Additionally, crustal rheology should involve a sufficiently strong lower crust to maintain the topography. Stratigraphic data on the basin scale suggests that the deformation in the Zagros Folded Belt initiated by inversion of the inherited N-S and NW-SE-trending marginal structures in the early Miocene. At 5 - 3 Ma, the intraplate stresses have increased sufficiently in response to ongoing convergence to exceed the brittle strength of the pre-fractured basement and then to produce the initiation of the Zagros uplift. This event occurred simultaneously with the rapid development of cover folding until the Bakhtyari conglomerates were deposited unconformably on these structures as the fold growth decreased. The Hormuz salts {{at the base of the}} pile allowed the upper sedimentary cover to be decoupled from the basement but there is no evidence of independent development through time. This is confirmed by the kinematical consistency of the Mio-Pliocene small-scale faulting in the cover and seismogenic faulting reflecting the internal deformation of basement and cover, despite the occurrence of the thick Hormuz salt layer. Buckling of the cover rocks, rather than thinskinned propagation of the Zagros Folded Belt, is proposed to be a more reliable mechanism to account for stratigraphic data, field observations, structural studies, microtectonic data and mechanical modelling. We finally conclude that the overall thick-skinned deformation that followed the initial margin inversion was probably coeval with cover folding (buckling). The way basement and cover deform is thus remarkably different; the basement is pre-fractured so it shortens preferentially by faulting. In contrast, the folding (buckling) of the sedimentary cover developed with the assistance of plastic-viscous processes. F. Mouthereau, O. Lacombe, J. Tensi, N. Bellahsen, S. Kargar, K. Amrouc...|$|E
40|$|If {{plutonism}} and granite emplacement {{are particularly}} well studied, associated fluid circulations within host rocks are poorly understood. For instance, path and final destination {{of these kinds}} of fluids are rarely identified and no clear ideas are available concerning their trapping. So, granite roof exposure represents a great deal in studying this problem. We herein present a case-study of Late-Hercynian granite roof affected by a fracture network evolving from early aplito-pegmatitic sills and dykes to late quartz gold-bearing veins. The Boborás granite is assumed to represent one of the syntectonic G 3 granite within the Hercynian belt of NW Spain (Galicia). Road cuttings and ancient mining works provide exceptional 3 D exposure of the granite roof, Palaeozoic host micaschist, and fracture network called the Bruès vein system. This one is concentrated around granite roof, within a 200 meters thick zone. At the granite contact, micaschist foliation is flat. Sills and low-angle dykes are filled by micro-granite and/or pegmatite. Both are crosscut by high-angle pegmatitic dykes which are frequently bordered by late quartz shear veins. Associated vertical “en echelon” tension gashes filled by quartz are also observed. All these structures are oriented E-W to NE-SW. It may be stressed that sills are sometimes directly linked with granitic bodies. <b>Microtectonics</b> investigations allow to determine that all these structures, since the earlier horizontal ones to the later high-dipping ones, are formed within a homogenous tectonic context characterized by north verging normal motion. Evidences are : i) top of granite, microgranite sills show a N-S submagmatic extension expressed by E-W trending microfractures of plagioclase crystals filled by magmatic quartz; ii) steped wall rock of high-angle microgranite dykes and sigmoidal sills are compatible with northward normal motion; iii) late quartz shear veins parallel to high-angle dykes are developed within north verging normal faults underlined by drag folds in micaschists. Microscopic textures of quartz shear veins are characteristic of syntectonic growth during north-directed normal tectonics. All the structures described above have been interpreted within a continuous long lived tectonic event associated with magmatic and hydrothermal fluid circulations. Because the structures evolved in time and space from near-horizontal to vertical ones, a regional extensional context is suspected to prevail during the Bruès vein system formation. The evolution of the subsequent deformation from submagmatic state through the ductile/brittle one until the brittle one agrees with the cooling of pluton in extensional context. However, this assumption needs to be confirmed in the light of more regional tectonic analyses. The Boborás granite and the Bruès vein system thus constitute a remarkable case study of geometrical and temporal association between open-fill fractures and intrusion. The lack of overprinting by high strain ductile structures (mylonite), makes possible to trace the continuous evolution from submagmatic to solid-state deformation. It also takes up the crucial role of strain localization at granite roof for development of fluid trapping structures...|$|E

Structural and <b>microtectonic</b> analyses of fault slip data collected in the field reveal that the volcanic margins of Yemen are affected by three main extensional tectonic events. The chronological order of these events is as follows: first E-W extension was associated with the emplacement of volcanic traps of Yemen, then NE-SW extension was related to the Red Sea rifting and finally the volcanic margin was submitted to N 160 °E extension, perpendicular to the overall trend of the Gulf of Aden, that we interpret as induced by the westward propagation of the oceanic ridge of the Gulf of Aden...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} borehole FAM- 1 a 175 m depth scientific drilling of the Alhama de Murcia fault. The borehole was drilled close to La Torrecilla rambla three km SW of Lorca where the fault zone shearing is more concentrated and it is dominated by well-developed clay rich fault gouge. To select the drilling point and to perform a prognosis of it, three trenches were excavated crossing the fault zone that allowed us to determine the detailed 3 D structure of the fault zone. We have collected more than 100 m of unaltered high quality fault rock to be studied using mineralogical and <b>microtectonic</b> analysis, and geomechanical testing that will improve {{the knowledge of the}} influence of tectonic microfabric and mineralogy in the seismogenic behavior of the AMF. The borehole FAM- 1 and the seismic monitoring borehole FamSis- 1 constitute the first stage of a future geological-geophysical observatory for monitoring the activity of the AMF. This research is part of the INTERGEO project: CGL 2013 - 47412 -C 2 - 1 -P. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of the pre-Eocene rocks, considered as the "basement " of the Philippines, has been investigated in the Mindoro-Lubang, Romblon-Tablas-Sibuyan, and North Palawan areas. In the former two areas the same pre-Eocene succession of units is recognized from top to bottom: (1) a pre-Eocene olistostrome; (2) an ophiolitic nappe; (3) a schistose sequence (pelites, sandstones, basic schists and marbles); and (4) a gneissic unit. The nature of the contact between the olistostrome and the underlying units is unclear, but the ophiolite and the schistose sequence form two thrust sheets of oceanic origin thrust upon the gneissic unit that is considered {{a part of a}} continental basement called the West Philippines Block. Small-scale structures show that the early deformation stage is characterized by a submeridian (0 ø-N 40 øE) lineation formed in greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions during the thrusting. Kinematic analysis show that the thrusting was from north to south. In North Palawan, metamorphic rocks with similar <b>microtectonic</b> and kinematic characteristics are found. They are overlain by a Late Jurassic olistostrom...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigated}} area of Western Karavanke lies in {{the zone}} of Sava Fault – the southern most part of the Periadriatic Fault zone. The work is based on detail structural mapping of the fault zones combined with measurements of <b>microtectonic</b> data used for paleostress tensor inversion. The prevailing orientation of fault zones in the studied area is generally E–W oriented with steep dips towards N with strike-slip kinematics as the main slip sense recorded on them. Alongside horizontal deformation, records of vertical movements on these faults are also {{to be seen in}} the field and the inversion data confirm such kinematic style with compressional stress regime. Two systems of connecting faults that lie between two strands of E–W oriented faults are also present in the studied area. Along both of them blocks of more deformable rocks were extruded on more rigid rock units. I connect the age of this style of deformation to post-collisional processes connected to Alpine orogenesis, and recent earthquakes in the area prove the ongoing active deformation of the area...|$|R
