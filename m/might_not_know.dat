In this episode, Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are invited to the wedding of Roy Anderson (Denman) Pam's former fiancé. Roy's wedding toast later leads to Pam and Jim searching their relationships for any secrets that the other <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> about. Jim, however, hides {{the fact that he}} has started a company with a college friend, and Pam grows more and more suspicious. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) reacts to Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) mandatory charity initiative by announcing he will donate to the Taliban.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E

25|$|The {{legitimacy}} of the subcell structure came from the recruitment process, originally by the case officer {{and then by the}} cell leaders. Sometimes, the cell leader would propose subcell member names to the case officer, so the case officer could have a headquarters name check run before bringing the individual into the subcell. In principle, however, the subcell members would know ALPINE, and sometimes {{the other members of the}} ALPINE cell if they needed to work together; if ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 had independent assignments, they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> each other. ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 certainly would not know ALASTAIR or anyone in the ALTITUDE or ALLOVER cells.|$|E
25|$|At Bishop Auckland, {{where two}} of his {{children}} were born, Frankland confined himself to his parochial duties. After the Restoration {{he was one of}} the first to be attacked for nonconformity. His living was in the bishop's gift, but John Cosin (consecrated 2 December 1660) did not interfere with a peaceable man. An attorney named Bowster demanded of him, ‘publickly before the congregation,’ whether he intended to conform. Frankland thought it would be time to answer this question when the terms of conformity had been settled; and meanwhile relied on the king's declaration (25 October 1660) dispensing with conformity. Bowster, with a neighbouring clergyman, got possession of the keys and locked Frankland out of his church. He indicted them for riot, but the case was dismissed at the assizes for a technical flaw in the indictment. Cosin now offered to institute Frankland and give him higher preferment if he would receive episcopal ordination. He even proposed, but without result, to ordain him conditionally, and ‘so privately that the people <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> of it.’ By the act of 1661 Frankland was confirmed in the possession of his living; but the uniformity act of the following year ejected him.|$|E

500|$|The {{month after}} the plan took effect, the Canadian {{government}} announced that the country's sex industry {{would no longer be}} allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking in that environment. As part of this policy, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stopped issuing new temporary work permits for foreigners seeking work with escort agencies, massage parlours, and strip clubs. Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, said that he hoped that the NAP-CHT would be strengthened by this new policy, and said that its purpose was to protect foreigners [...] "from what they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> will happen to them when they get to Canada." [...] That November, Status of Women Canada sought to support the NAP-CHT by soliciting the public for proposals of how to best support community organizations that serve female victims of sex traffickingthe most common victims of this form of trafficking. In late 2012, Smith launched the Joy Smith Foundation as a follow-up to the NAP-CHT; this nonpartisan, apolitical foundation is dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing support to human trafficking victims with counselling, housing, and clothing.|$|E

In early 2012, they announced Australasian and North American legs of the concert tour, with dates from April to July 2012. The tour, comprising 62 shows, was met with positivity both critically and commercially. A recording of a concert from the tour, , was released in May 2012. In addition to the DVD topping the charts in twenty-five countries, its global sales had exceeded 1 million copies by August 2012. One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, published in the United States in May 2012, topped The New York Times Best Seller list. In June 2012, Nick Gatfield, the {{chairman and chief executive}} officer of Sony Music Entertainment UK, stated how he expects One Direction to represent a $100million business empire over 2013. Gatfield was quoted as saying, [...] "What you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> about One Direction is that they already represent a $50million business and that's a figure we expect to double next year". In August 2012, the group's record sales exceeded 8 million singles, 3million albums, and 1million DVDs, and they performed [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, which represented the handover to Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

2500|$|Supporters of qualia {{could point}} out {{that in order for}} you to notice a change in qualia, you must compare your current qualia with your {{memories}} of past qualia. Arguably, such a comparison would involve immediate apprehension of your current qualia and your memories of past qualia, but not the past qualia themselves. Furthermore, modern functional brain imaging has increasingly suggested that the memory of an experience is processed in similar ways and in similar zones of the brain as those originally involved in the original perception. This may mean that there would be asymmetry in outcomes between altering the mechanism of perception of qualia and altering their memories. If the diabolical neurosurgery altered the immediate perception of qualia, you might not even notice the inversion directly, since the brain zones which re-process the memories would themselves invert the qualia remembered. On the other hand, alteration of the qualia memories themselves would be processed without inversion, and thus you would perceive them as an inversion. Thus, you might know immediately if memory of your qualia had been altered, but <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if immediate qualia were inverted or whether the diabolical neurosurgeons had done a sham procedure [...]|$|E

For 33 years, she was president of “The Fortnightly,” the literary society of her church. To “The Maples" [...] in its more than half-century of life came many authors; among them Emerson, searching the vicinity for the lost grave of his grandfather {{who died in the}} American Revolutionary War. At the Atlantic breakfast given in honor of Dr. Holmes’ 70th birthday, Dorr was warned that Emerson, shadowed as he then was by loss of memory, <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> her. But the minute he saw her he exclaimed, “Oh, Mrs. Dorr, I shall never forget the view of Killington from your piazza!" [...] Here, too, came authors’ second-selves, their books, inscribed by their own hands; and authors’ letters, both congratulatory and purely friendly, Longfellow’s, Whittier’s, Emerson’s—covering many years —Dr. Holmes’, the one she knew best of the Cambridge group, Stedman’s, R. H. Stoddard’s, his wife’s, Howells'—But to name them all would be to recite a long list of the makers of American literature. Nor of American literature alone. One of the pleasantest consequences of her last public appearance at the Howells’ birthday dinner was the personal touch it gave her with the English poet, William Watson.|$|E
2500|$|Musically, A Girl like Me reveals {{new types}} of musical genres {{compared}} to Rihanna's light and uptempo debut effort, Music of the Sun. Her goal on the album was to find songs that express the many things young women want to say, but <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how. In an interview, Rihanna said: [...] "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] Reggae music, present in her debut album, subsequently continues into A Girl like Me. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different music genres, including rock music, while keeping the roots of her previous album, which where reggae and dancehall. The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some balladic elements. Although the album mostly follows the disco-ish mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae mash-up [...] "Kisses Don't Lie", though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence. In an interview, Rihanna commented: [...] "Growing up in Barbados, I wasn't exposed {{to a lot of}} rock music. We really love reggae and soca music and hip-hop. But when I moved to the United States last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [...] I love rock music." [...] Celia SanMiguel of Vibe [...] magazine wrote that A Girl like Me is [...] "a pop album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's Caribbean roots", and that it [...] "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-R ambassador." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the album [...] "a record that almost identically" [...] veered between [...] "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", [...] "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and [...] "adult-oriented ballads".|$|E
2500|$|... ll New-York {{moves on}} the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the {{everlasting}} hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the world seems to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, they sit on the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world. And I, who have almost as strong a love of localities as poor puss, turn away from the windows, with a suppressed anathema on the nineteenth century, with its perpetual changes.
