40|$|In this dissertation, {{we focus}} on inverse {{problems}} related to image processing. We have studied two separate inverse problems and developed two different reconstruction algorithms which {{can be applied to}} the two cases. First, we consider the problem of monitoring the concentration and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere using a collection of randomly scattered sensors. The sensors are capable of only indicating that the concentration has exceeded a randomly selected threshold and providing this information through a transponder-like mechanism to an airborne imaging radar. We use this information to estimate the concentration as well as the time and location of the pollutant source. We use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the quantities of interest and determine the accuracy of this technique using standard atmospheric dispersion models. ^ Second, {{we focus on}} image interpolation. We have developed a method to select the best interpolation algorithm for different regions of an image. In particular, we segment the <b>image</b> into <b>graphical</b> and natural regions and use the appropriate algorithm for each region. The natural regions are interpolated using a current state-of-the-art algorithm. However, when applied to <b>graphical</b> <b>images,</b> the current state-of-the-art interpolators tend to produce artifacts at edge discontinuities. Thus, we developed a novel approach which we call Low Entropy Interpolation (LEI) algorithm for the <b>graphical</b> <b>images.</b> The LEI algorithm is highly non-linear and produces very sharp edges with very few defects necessary for good quality interpolation of <b>graphical</b> <b>images.</b> ...|$|R

This system consists of a visual Web page interface, an SQL database, and a <b>graphical</b> <b>image</b> generator. These combine to allow a user to ascertain quickly {{the status of the}} inspection process, and current determination of any problem zones. The TIIMS system allows inspection engineers to enter their determinations into a database and to link pertinent images and video to those database entries. The database then assigns criteria to each zone and tile, and via query, sends the information to a <b>graphical</b> <b>image</b> generation program. Using the official TIPS database tile positions and sizes, the <b>graphical</b> <b>image</b> generation program creates images of the current status of the orbiter, coloring zones, and tiles based on a predefined key code. These images are then displayed on a Web page using customized JAVA scripts to display the appropriate zone of the orbiter based on the location of the user's cursor. The close-up graphic and database entry for that particular zone can then be seen by selecting the zone. This page contains links into the database to access the images used by the inspection engineer when they make the determination entered into the database.
