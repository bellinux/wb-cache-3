25|$|Baronies were social {{units and}} their courts {{a form of}} council which enabled {{the area of the}} barony to {{function}} effectively as an early form of self-government. In mediaeval law the barony required a principal residence at which the legal process could be formally transacted. Many abandoned castles <b>motes</b> therefore continued in use for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th-century the Tinwald Mote near Dumfries {{was still}} the legal head of the barony, where sasine (possession) was given by the {{ceremony}} of handing the grantee, before witnesses, a handful of earth and stone from the head messuage called the Mote near the church of Tynwald. In mediaeval law the barony required a principal residence at which the legal process could be formally transacted, which explains why many such <b>motes</b> as that at Ellon were retained, here by the earls of Buchan, when little else remained of their possessions in the district. The mote still carried {{the dignity of the}} earldom.|$|E

500|$|The other {{radioactive}} element in use was polonium, {{which was used}} in the initiator. It was one of the parts of the Manhattan Project that the British mission had not been involved in, and little was known about its chemistry and properties, except that it had a half life of 138 days. A disturbing discovery was that <b>motes</b> of polonium could propel themselves through the air using their own alpha particle emissions. Safety procedures had to be tightened. It was produced at Windscale by irradiation of bismuth. A special plant was built there to extract it, but it was not operational until June 1952. The final product was just [...] of polonium, less than 1mg. It was only just available on time for Operation Hurricane.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} the character level cap, character progression shifts to improving their [...] "Light" [...] level by acquiring {{new and better}} equipment. This equipment can be gained {{through a variety of}} sources, including [...] "strikes", raids, and in-game events. Prior to The Taken King, all legendary and exotic armor, and some rare, contained an attribute called Light. Once players reached level 20, they no longer earned experience to level up; EXP earned after level 20 went towards upgrading weapons and armor, and creating <b>Motes</b> of Light, an in-game currency. Players could only go beyond level 20 by obtaining armor with Light, and these levels were referred to as Light levels. The initial Light level cap was 30, which increased to 32 with The Dark Below and 34 with the House of Wolves. Update patch 2.0, released in preparation for The Taken King, made the character's experience level and Light level separate: level 34 is now the experience level cap for all players; level 40 for players who own The Taken King and Rise of Iron. A higher character level allows for better equipment to be equipped. A character's Light level is now an average of the attack and defense of all equipped gear. For example, if all equipped gear has 170 Light each, the character's Light level will be 170. A higher Light level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Light level was 320 for players who owned The Taken King; the expansion's [...] increased it to 335. Rise of Iron increased the highest obtainable Light level to 400.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we have {{fabricated}} a p-type multi-layered <b>MoTe</b> 2 transistor by transferring <b>MoTe</b> 2 onto fabricated source-drain electrode in air. Vacuum- and temperature-dependent in situ charge transport measurements {{demonstrate that}} the usual p-type conductance of multi-layered <b>MoTe</b> 2 transistor is not its intrinsic properties, which is caused by oxygen/water redox couple doping in air. When the <b>MoTe</b> 2 transistor is heated in vacuum to remove absorbates, it exhibits n-type conductance, which is attributed to tellurium vacancies in <b>MoTe</b> 2 and is its intrinsic transport property. Both p-type and n-type <b>MoTe</b> 2 transistors show smaller effective Schottky barrier height, which is partially due to the modification by absorbates. The lowered effective Schottky barrier is beneficial to achieving a high-performance <b>MoTe</b> 2 transistor. Based on these findings, we fabricate a complementary inverter with gain values as high as 9.|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) <b>MoTe</b> 2 has {{attracted}} much attention due to its predicted Weyl semimetal (WSM) state and a quantum spin Hall insulator in bulk and monolayer form, respectively. We find that the superconductivity in <b>MoTe</b> 2 single crystal can be much enhanced by the partial substitution of the Te ions by the S ones. The maximum of the superconducting temperature TC of <b>MoTe</b> 1. 8 S 0. 2 single crystal is about 1. 3 K. Compared with the parent <b>MoTe</b> 2 single crystal (TC= 0. 1 K), nearly 13 -fold in TC is improved in <b>MoTe</b> 1. 8 S 0. 2 one. The superconductivity has been investigated by the resistivity and magnetization measurements. <b>MoTe</b> 2 -xSx single crystals belong to weak coupling superconductors and {{the improvement of the}} superconductivity {{may be related to the}} enhanced electron-phonon coupling induced by the S-ion substitution. A dome-shape superconducting phase diagram is obtained in the S-doped <b>MoTe</b> 2 single crystals. <b>MoTe</b> 2 -xSx materials may provide a new platform for our understanding of superconductivity phenomena and topological physics in TMDs.
