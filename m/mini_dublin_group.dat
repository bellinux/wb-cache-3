5000|$|In Ireland, most originally-feudal titular baronies {{have long}} {{disappeared}} through obsolescence or disuse. The Lordship of Fingal was granted to Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath for seven knight's fees, [...] "although the lords thereof hold elsewhere in capite", {{according to the}} unusual grant in 1208 by King John as Lord of Ireland, who allowed de Lacy to retain custody of his fees. [...] Fingal at the time spread from the River Liffey to the River Delvin, north of Dublin, similar to the administrative boundary of today's County Fingal (<b>minus</b> <b>Dublin</b> City) created from part of County Dublin in 1994. A small number of other titular baronies also continued to exist either as submerged titles {{of members of the}} Peerages of Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom, or as titles held by grand serjeanty, such as, originally, Fingal. Those few that thus survive at all are traditionally considered [...] "incorporeal hereditaments", and may continue to exist as interests or estates in land, registrable as such upon conveyance or inheritance under the Registry of Deeds of the Government of Ireland, although increasingly these are seen today as titles held in gross as personal rights, and not as real interests in land.|$|R
