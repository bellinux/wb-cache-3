40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> in Department of Defense {{commodities}} acquisition. It examines the feasibility of outsourcing <b>market</b> <b>research</b> functions in this acquisition arena, focusing on which elements of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> would be most practicable to outsource, and what capacity exists in private industry to provide <b>market</b> <b>research</b> services for the Federal acquisition environment. Given {{the reduction in the}} defense acquisition workforce, budgetary constraints, and emphasis on acquisition reform, effective <b>market</b> <b>research</b> significantly enhances optimal use of available resources. However, general consensus among defense acquisition professionals is that <b>market</b> <b>research</b> is not conducted as effectively as possible due to limitations of time, training and management attention. While legislation has directed the use of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> for multiple aspects of the acquisition cycle, to include requirements development, maximization of competition, source selection, and emulation of better business practices, <b>market</b> <b>research</b> skills vary among DoD acquisition personnel, as does appreciation for its value as a management tool. The conclusion is that while there are issues and concerns to be addressed when considering outsourcing <b>market</b> <b>research,</b> private industry does offer a viable alternative for conducting <b>market</b> <b>research</b> functions in DoD commodity acquisitions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{investigate}} whether strategic orientation affects {{the evaluation of}} specific <b>market</b> <b>research</b> projects in for-profit firms. Design/methodology/approach - A small-scale follow-up survey was conducted, building on qualitative and quantitative research among {{a sample of the}} top- 1, 000 marketing managers in Australia. The study used an existing <b>market</b> <b>research</b> evaluation tool, the USER scale and items generated from the qualitative research, to investigate the firm 2 ̆ 7 s most recent <b>market</b> <b>research</b> project. Findings - Four <b>market</b> <b>research</b> performance factors were identified - <b>market</b> <b>research</b> as a knowledge enhancing (KE) function, the internal political use of <b>market</b> <b>research,</b> the misuse of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> and the generation of market understanding. The Miles and Snow strategy types were related to these factors, with Prospector types more likely to use <b>market</b> <b>research</b> rationally and less likely to use it for internal political purposes. Tactical projects {{were more likely to be}} misused than were those with a strategic orientation. Prospectors were far less likely and analysers far more likely to misuse tactical research projects. Prospectors were more often satisfied with the performance of their most recent <b>market</b> <b>research.</b> The Porter typology was less successful in predicting <b>market</b> <b>research</b> performance. Research limitations/implications - The study was based on a small sample of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> projects in Australian for-profit firms. Future studies need to study these phenomena more intensively using ethnographic methods and more extensively using larger multi-country samples. Practical implications - <b>Market</b> <b>research</b> suppliers should learn the nature of their client 2 ̆ 7 s strategic intent to improve their effectiveness. Defender firms should carefully monitor the use of <b>market</b> <b>research,</b> especially that of a tactical nature, which may be wasted or misused. Originality/value - Contributes to an understanding of how strategic orientation relates to the ways <b>market</b> <b>research</b> information is used within the firm. <br /...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} 42 Australian {{marketing}} managers was conducted linking strategy {{to the use}} of <b>market</b> <b>research,</b> with a measure known as USER. It was expected that the Miles and Snow strategic typology with its greater emphasis on internal organisational culture, practices and structure would be more powerful than the Porter strategic dimensions in determining the motivation and actual use of <b>market</b> <b>research.</b> The findings showed that neither strategic typology was superior in predicting <b>market</b> <b>research</b> practice. In the study, the USER characteristics most linked to strategy were “the misuse of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> for political purposes” and “internal improvements based on <b>market</b> <b>research.</b> ” Two other USER factors “rational use of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> findings” and “use of <b>market</b> <b>research</b> to confirm decisionmaking” were not found to be related to marketing strategy. <br /...|$|R

25|$|By {{presenting}} such a card, purchasers typically {{earn the}} right either to a discount {{on the current}} purchase, or to an allotment of points {{that they can use}} for future purchases. Hence the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its <b>marketing</b> <b>research.</b> Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent-flyer card).|$|E
25|$|Bayes {{methods are}} more cost {{effective}} than the traditional frequentist take on <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a degree of belief before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out {{a large number of}} trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to see how a decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through iteration, it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to logically contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.|$|E
