5|$|Jordan persuaded Hill to {{at least}} stay for the British Grand Prix. Going into that race weekend, Hill {{announced}} he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill {{changed his mind and}} decided to see out the year. His best result {{for the remainder of the}} season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the Prost Grand Prix team would release Jarno Trulli early after he signed for Jordan's 2000 campaign as Hill's replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the constructor's championship. Hill's last race was the Japanese Grand Prix where he spun off the track and pulled into the pits citing <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fatigue {{can be both}} {{physical}} and <b>mental.</b> Physical <b>fatigue</b> is the inability to continue functioning {{at the level of}} one's normal abilities; a person with physical fatigue cannot lift as heavy a box or walk {{as far as he could}} if not fatigued.|$|R

25|$|As {{the name}} indicates, dirty, {{dangerous}} and demeaning work can impose severe {{physical and mental}} costs on workers. There is often a risk of early retirement due to injury, general joint depletion or <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue.</b> After witnessing the constant physical and mental injury to coworkers or even death, the stress can cause <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue</b> and post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>fatigue</b> is a {{temporary}} inability to maintain optimal cognitive performance. The onset of <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue</b> during any cognitive activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's cognitive ability, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. <b>Mental</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{has also been shown}} to decrease physical performance. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue. Decreased attention is known as ego depletion and occurs when the limited 'self-regulatory capacity' is depleted. It may also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep. However, objective cognitive testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain disease from those attributable to tiredness.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{insomnia}} {{lasts for}} longer than a month. It {{can be caused by}} another disorder, or it can be a primary disorder. People with high levels of stress hormones or shifts in the levels of cytokines are more likely than others to have chronic insomnia. Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular weariness, hallucinations, and/or <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Chronic insomnia can cause double vision.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is a {{subjective}} feeling of tiredness which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise. <b>Mental</b> <b>fatigue</b> is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that Fe {{deficiency}} has {{a negative impact on}} cognitive function in children by altering brain energy metabolism and neurotransmitter function. It is unclear whether Fe deficiency has detrimental effects on cognition, <b>mental</b> health and <b>fatigue</b> in women of childbearing age. Our aim was to systematically review the literature to determine whether Fe deficiency in women of childbearing age affects cognition, <b>mental</b> health and <b>fatigue,</b> and whether a change in Fe status results in improvements in cognition, <b>mental</b> health and <b>fatigue.</b> Studies using Fe supplement interventions were reviewed to examine the effect of Fe deficiency in women of childbearing age (13 – 45 years) on their cognition, <b>mental</b> health and <b>fatigue.</b> English-language articles ranging from the earliest record to the year 2011 were sourced. The quality of retrieved articles was assessed and the Fe pathology, cognitive, <b>mental</b> health and <b>fatigue</b> data were extracted. Means and standard deviations from cognitive test data were included in meta-analyses of combined effects. Of the 1348 studies identified, ten were included in the review. Three studies showed poorer cognition and mental health scores and increased fatigue with Fe deficiency at baseline. Seven studies reported an improvement in cognitive test scores after Fe treatment. Results of three of these studies were included in meta-analyses of the effect of Fe supplement intervention on cognition. The results of the meta-analyses showed a significant improvement in Arithmetic scores after treatment (P < 0 · 01), but no effect on Digit Symbol, Digit Span or Block Design. While an improvement in cognition after Fe treatment was seen in seven out of ten studies, the evidence base is limited by poor study quality and heterogeneity across studies. Additional high-quality studies using consistent measures are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{studies on}} the {{association}} of job dissatisfaction with mental health have been conducted in the past, few studies {{have dealt with the}} complicated links connecting job stress, job dissatisfaction, and stress-related illness. This study seeks to determine how job dissatisfaction is linked to common mental health issues. This study surveyed 3, 172 civil servants (2, 233 men and 939 women) in 1998, taking poor <b>mental</b> functioning, <b>fatigue,</b> and sleep disturbance as stress-related mental health problems. We examine how psychosocial risk factors at work and job dissatisfaction are associated independently with poor <b>mental</b> functioning, <b>fatigue,</b> and sleep disturbance after adjustment for other known risk factors, and how job dissatisfaction contributes to change in the degree of association between psychosocial risk factors at work and mental health problems. In general, psychosocial risk factors were independently associated with mental health problems. When adjusted for job dissatisfaction, not only was job satisfaction independently associated with mental health problems but it was also found that the association of psychosocial risk factors with mental health problems declined. Our results suggest that, although longitudinal research is necessary, attitudes toward satisfaction at work can potentially decrease the negative effects of psychosocial risk factors at work on mental health...|$|R

25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and <b>mental</b> <b>fatigue.</b> As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{prevalence}} of sleep problems in a community-based sample of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in Norway, and their associated factors. Methods 176 consecutive PD outpatients (41 % females) were included in a study of non-motor symptoms, including sleep problems. All participants responded to the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), where an overall score below 82 or a score below 5 on a sub-item indicate possible sleep problem. Factors associated with sleep were also investigated, with special emphasis on severity of PD, <b>fatigue,</b> <b>mental</b> health and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Results The mean age was 68. 5 [*]years (range 35 – 90); the mean Hoehn and Yahr stage was 2. 11 (SD 0. 86), and the mean UPDRS part III was 22. 3 (SD 11. 7). Sleep problems were common among PD patients. While only 17 % of the sample had an overall score below 82 on the PDSS, 70 % of the patients had a score below 5 on one item. There was no significant association between PD severity and any of the sleep items in the PDSS; whereas <b>fatigue,</b> <b>mental</b> health problems, and RLS were associated with PDSS score. Conclusions The current findings call for increased awareness of sleep problems in PD patients, especially focusing on the association with <b>mental</b> health problems, <b>fatigue</b> and RLS. </p...|$|R
