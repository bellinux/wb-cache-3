5000|$|The <b>moenomycins</b> can {{be reduced}} to three key {{structural}} features ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>moenomycins</b> target {{bacterial}} peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases, inhibiting {{cell wall}} formation, leading to cell death. In general, the antibiotics are particularly potent against gram-positive bacteria {{with a minimum}} inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 1-100 (ng/ml). At higher concentrations the <b>moenomycins</b> are also effective against gram-negative bacteria with an MIC between 0.3-150 (μg/ml). In vivo studies using mice models suggest the antibiotics are powerful prophylactic and therapeutic agents, with subcutaneous injection being the most effective mode of delivery. <b>Moenomycins</b> A and C are commercially used {{in the formulation of}} Bambermycins (Flavomycin), a veterinary antibiotic used solely in poultry, swine, and cattle feed.|$|R

50|$|Based on {{degradation}} experiments, {{the defining}} {{mark of a}} <b>moenomycin</b> {{is the presence of}} the 25-carbon alcohol moenocinol or diumycinol upon hydrolysis of the lipid tail; these alcohols originate from the L1 or L2 lipid respectively in the figure. These two structures are the only observed lipid tails within the <b>moenomycin</b> family, with AC326-α being the only known for producing diumycinol.|$|E

50|$|The 25-carbon lipid tail confers to the <b>moenomycins</b> a detergent-like {{property}} {{that allows them}} to become incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane of the target bacterial cell. This anchoring presents the oligosaccharide portion of the molecule to the transglycosylase where it can tightly and selectively bind the enzyme, inhibiting cell wall growth. This property however undermines their use in clinical settings. The amphiphilic nature of the <b>moenomycins</b> induce hemolytic activity, provide a long half-life in the blood stream, and creates a tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Comparison of <b>moenomycins</b> with an abridged isoprene chain of 10-carbons, show that the oligosaccharide can still tightly bind the enzyme active site, but in vivo the MIC significantly increases since the drug is unable to anchor itself to the cytoplasmic membrane and present its sugar moiety. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal length for favorable pharmacokinetic properties.|$|R

50|$|Extensive {{exploration}} into the biosynthesis of the <b>moenomycin</b> {{family has been}} conducted to better inform the genetic engineering and biosynthesis of novel <b>moenomycin</b> analogues. Early work on the biosynthesis of the moenomycins focused on the 25-carbon lipid tail derived from moenocinol; the tail was of particular interest given that it appears to break the isoprene rule at C8, containing a quaternary carbon. Feeding studies revealed the moenocinol lipid tail originates from a 15-carbon farnesyl precursor and a 10-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the lipid portion, the oligosaccharide portion of the <b>moenomycins</b> is relatively well understood.

50|$|More recently, the biosynthetic {{gene cluster}} for <b>moenomycin</b> A was first {{described}} in 2007 in Streptomyces ghanaensis. In 2009, the seventeen step biosynthetic pathway was completely characterized, revealing {{the order of}} assembly for the molecular scaffold.|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} in 1965, the moenomycins are {{a family of}} phosphoglycolipid antibiotics, metabolites of the Streptomyces genus of bacteria. <b>Moenomycin</b> A is the {{founding member of the}} antibiotic family with the majority discovered {{by the end of the}} late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} the {{tetrasaccharide}} portion, stereochemistry and functionality can differ at R1 and R2 depending on if this saccharide unit is D-gluco versus D-galacto; there is an axial methyl group in the former case {{with the exception of}} <b>moenomycin</b> A12 and C1 where there is instead an axial hydroxyl. The oligosaccharide motif can be deoxygenated, hydroxylated, or glycosylated at the R3 position - notable examples of the pentasaccharide motif include <b>moenomycin</b> A and AC326-α. It is believed the additional glycan can enhance specificity and binding to the target protein, affording increased activity. With the exception of pholipomycin and AC326-α, the R4 saccharide unit is usually the deoxysaccharide. Lastly, in the majority of moenomycins the R5 position is linked to a 2-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dione - a convenient chromophore utilized for structural analysis. For the nosokomycin subfamily, this position forms a carboxamide or carboxylic acid.|$|E
50|$|The <b>moenomycin</b> family {{functions}} as an antibiotic by reversibly binding bacterial transglycosylases, essential enzymes that catalyze {{the extension of}} the glycan chain of the cell wall to form a stable peptidoglycan layer. The moenomycins mimic and thus compete with the natural substrate of the enzyme, inhibiting growth of the cell wall. Compromise of the wall results in leakage of cell contents, and ultimately cell death. The moenomycins are the only known active site inhibitors of these enzymes, which in lies their promise as human antibiotics given pathogenic bacteria have not yet widely evolved resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid rise}} of multi-drug-resistant {{bacteria}} {{is a global}} healthcare crisis, and new antibiotics are urgently required, especially those with modes of action that have low-resistance potential. One promising lead is the liposaccharide antibiotic <b>moenomycin</b> that inhibits bacterial glycosyltransferases, which are essential for peptidoglycan polymerization, while displaying a low rate of resistance. Unfortunately, the lipophilicity of <b>moenomycin</b> leads to unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties that render it unsuitable for systemic administration. In this study, we show that using <b>moenomycin</b> and other glycosyltransferase inhibitors as templates, {{we were able to}} synthesize compound libraries based on novel pyranose scaffold chemistry, with moenomycin-like activity, but with improved drug-like properties.

40|$|Flavomycin is {{a commercially}} {{available}} antimicrobial growth promoter and an authorized additive {{for feeding stuffs}} in the EU and in the USA. As most antibiotically active products biosynthesized by microorganisms, it contains not only a single active compound but is a complex mixture of structurally closely related substances. Multistage matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-ion trap/reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-IT-MS) were utilized for {{a detailed analysis of}} the constituents of the Flavomycin complex based on low-energy collision induced dissociation (CID). An optimal sample preparation for negative ion vacuum MALDI-MS for this compound class was developed. The MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS 2 and -MS 3 analysis starting with the precursor [M - H]- ions of these interesting phosphoglycolipids, named moenomycins, yielded a large variety of product ions that facilitated the structural characterization of this class of compounds.

40|$|An {{association}} between <b>moenomycin</b> resistance and vancomycin intermediate resistance in Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated previously. Thus, to elucidate {{the mechanism of}} vancomycin intermediate resistance, we searched for factors contributing to <b>moenomycin</b> resistance. Random Tn 551 insertional mutagenesis of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain COL yielded three mutants with decreased susceptibilities to <b>moenomycin.</b> Correspondingly, these mutants also exhibited slightly decreased susceptibilities to vancomycin. Genetic analysis revealed {{that two of the}} mutants had Tn 551 insertions in the fmtC (mprF) gene, which is associated with the synthesis of lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol. The third Tn 551 insertion was located in the lysC gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of lysine from aspartic acid. Consequently, mutations in both of these loci reduced the lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol content in the cell membrane, giving it a more negative net charge. The positively charged antibiotic gentamicin and cationic antimicrobial peptides such as beta-defensins and CAP 18 were more effective against the mutants. The levels of <b>moenomycin</b> and vancomycin binding to intact cells was also greater in the mutants than in the wild type, while the binding affinity was not altered when cells boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate were used, indicating that both agents had higher affinities for the negatively charged membranes of the mutants. Therefore, the membrane charge of S. aureus appears to influence the efficacies of <b>moenomycin,</b> vancomycin, and other cationic antimicrobial agents...|$|E

A newly discovered byproduct of sulfoxide reactions was isolated that resulted in substantial loss of the glycosyl acceptor. A general method to suppress this byproduct was introduced, which enabled the glycosylations to proceed efficiently.

Because bacterial transglycosylases are difficult enzymes to study, it has not previously been possible to evaluate how <b>moenomycin</b> inhibits them or to determine whether glycopeptide analogues directly target them. We have identified transglycosylase assay conditions that enable kinetic analysis of inhibitors and have examined the inhibition of Escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein 1 b (PBP 1 b) by <b>moenomycin</b> as well as by various glycopeptides. We report that chlorobiphenyl vancomycin analogues that are incapable of binding substrates nevertheless inhibit E. coli PBP 1 b, which shows that these compounds interact directly with the enzyme. These findings support the hypothesis that chlorobiphenyl vancomycin derivatives overcome vanA resistance by targeting bacterial transglycosylases. We have also found that <b>moenomycin</b> is not competitive with respect to the lipid II substrate of PBP 1 b, as has long been believed.

40|$|Forty years ago, <b>moenomycin</b> was {{reported}} {{as a representative}} of a novel natural product class with strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms. <b>Moenomycin</b> was developed as an antimicrobial growth promoter in animal feeds. Mechanistically, <b>moenomycin</b> acts via inhibition of the transglycosylation process at the final stage of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis, in particular through binding directly to the transglycosylase enzymes, thereby preventing polymerisation of lipid II into linear peptidoglycan. Despite <b>moenomycin</b> 2 ̆ 7 s success, no developments of direct transglycosylase enzyme inhibitors were reported for over 30 years, probably due to the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the transglycosylation process, in particular the number of enzymes involved in the process and their specific roles. The development of better research tools and an improved understanding of the transglycosylation process, together with the increasing threat presented by multidrug-resistant bacteria, have led to a resurfacing of interest in targeting the forgotten transglycosylases. In addition, several new generation glycopeptides in clinical development inhibit the transglycosylation process, adding further value to the approach. In this paper, we summarise some of the developments in the area of transglycosylase inhibitors over the last 10 years...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study {{the influence of a}} new antibiotic, <b>moenomycin,</b> upon the performance of broilers, and broiler breeder, White Leghorn, and Brown Leghorn hens. With broilers maintained in floor pens, a significant body weight response at both four and eight weeks of age resulted from the feeding of moenomycin; however, {{there were no significant differences}} between the various levels of supplementation (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 or 4. 0 mg. /kg.). Oxytetracycline supplementation of the basal diet gave a numerical but not significant im-provement in body weights. Broiler breeder hens received either 4 mg. /kg. of <b>moenomycin</b> or 11 mg. /kg. of oxytetra-cycline for four 28 -day experimental periods. No significant treatment differences were found in egg production, feed efficiency, daily feed intake, body weight gains, mortality, egg weight or hatch of fertile eggs.

40|$|The glycosyltransferases {{of family}} 51 (GT 51) {{catalyze}} the polymerization of lipid II to form linear glycan chains, which following cross linking by the transpeptidases form the net-like peptidoglycan macromolecule.

In this work, we have used a surface plasmon resonance Biacore(®) biosensor, based on an amine derivative of <b>moenomycin</b> A immobilized on a sensor chip surface, to investigate the mechanism of binding of substrate analogous inhibitors to the GT. Addition of increasing concentrations of <b>moenomycin</b> A to the Staphylococcus aureus MtgA led to reduced binding of the protein to the sensor chip as expected. Remarkably, in the presence of low concentrations of the most active disaccharide inhibitors, binding of MtgA to immobilized <b>moenomycin</b> A was found to increase; in contrast competition with <b>moenomycin</b> A occurred only at high concentrations. This finding suggests that at low concentrations, the lipid II analogs bind to the acceptor site and induce a cooperative binding of <b>moenomycin</b> A to the donor site. Our results constitute the first indication of the existence of a positive cooperativity between the acceptor and the donor sites of GTs. In addition, our study indicates that a modification of two residues (L 119 N and F 120 S) within the hydrophobic region of MtgA can yield monodisperse forms of the protein with apparently no change in its secondary structure content, but this is {{at the expense of the}} enzyme function. status: publishe...|$|E
