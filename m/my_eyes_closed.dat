500|$|In May 2009, Tovey {{announced}} that she had filmed her final scenes with Home and Away. Lasance said he was sad but [...] "fortunate" [...] to work alongside Tovey. He credited their off-screen friendship as making Aden and Belle's dynamic develop successfully. In the weeks before filming her final scenes, Tovey asked Welsh how Belle would be written out. It was then she found out that Belle would die shortly after her wedding with Aden. Tovey said she was teary, but pleased with the way Belle would depart. Tovey said that filming her exit scenes were more emotional. Her last scene with Lasance required her to portray Belle's death scene. She added [...] "I had <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and he was holding me really tight", after the director cut the scene they pair could not separate themselves.|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
60|$|The cord which bound me was undone and {{the sack}} drawn from over my head. With <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> I lay {{motionless}} upon the floor.|$|E
50|$|The single Even With <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>Close</b> {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Georg Siegl of Metal Heaven, but then the singer Robert Lindell quit the band and everything fell apart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never forget}} any ground I've been over. I keep <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> ahead. All that seems {{strange to me}} is the wrong way. What I've seen, before must be the right way, because I saw it when they brought me from Surprise Valley." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange that boys {{should be able}} to sleep under such {{circumstances}} as these, and yet the permission had no sooner been given by the scout than I was stretched out at full length, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closing</b> despite all efforts to keep them open.|$|R
6000|$|She faltered, {{and still}} I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> I {{did not want}} to wake up from that dream. [...] "Have I been very--very sad?" [...] she went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{the least}} tired," [...] she said coldly; [...] "I thank you, milor. The colours and the light were so {{dazzling}} for the moment, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> involuntarily." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must really}} rest {{a little before}} I can get on any farther. When I have {{reclined}} for a few minutes, with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and when Louis has refreshed my poor aching temples with a little eau-de-Cologne, I {{may be able to}} proceed.|$|E
5000|$|... "When <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> shall <b>close</b> in death" [...] was {{originally}} written as [...] "When my eye-strings break in death".|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{thought of}} that," [...] he answered, [...] "and I mean to ca' caller." [...] (When in Scotland as laird of Seldon, Charles loves both to dress {{and to speak}} the part thoroughly.) [...] "First thing to-morrow I shall {{telegraph}} over to inquire at Glen-Ellachie; I shall find out whether this is really young Granton or not; meanwhile, I shall keep <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>close</b> upon the fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|I became {{suddenly}} extremely {{delighted with}} my company. A man who “lived by his sword,” before <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>close</b> at <b>my</b> elbow! So such people did {{exist in the}} world yet! I had not been born too late! And across the table with his air of watchful, unmoved benevolence, enough in itself to arouse one’s interest, there was {{the man with the}} story of a shipwreck that mustn’t be shouted on housetops. Why? ...|$|R
60|$|Sleepily I {{thought we}} might find before many hours had passed that all the {{shooting}} {{was not to be}} done by us; but the idea was no more than in mind when <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> again, and I was not conscious of the surroundings until Kenton shook me roughly.|$|E
60|$|We covered twenty-two miles by sundown, {{a rather}} poor day's showing; and camped {{on the bare}} flat desert, using water and wood we had packed with us. The last thing I remembered, as <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> heavily, was what a blessing it was to rest and to sleep.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} call up former {{favorite}} views of mountain and sea, so as to compare them with this; but the memory pictures refused to come, even with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> Then I returned to camp, with unsettled, troubled mind, and was silent, wondering at the strange feeling burning within me.|$|E
5000|$|The text of Zur Nacht (At Night) is {{a poem by}} Franz Engel {{with the}} incipit [...] "Nun fallen die Augen müde mir zu" [...] (Now <b>my</b> tired <b>eyes</b> <b>close).</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{watched the}} {{play for a}} few minutes and, to my surprise, Cecil was still winning. Then {{gradually}} a powerful, overmastering sleepiness crept over me. I tried to stave it off by walking about, by talking to Milly, by concentrating my thoughts upon the play. It was useless. I felt <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closing</b> and the sounds and voices in the room grew dimmer and less distinct. For a while I remained in a semi-conscious state--half awake and half asleep--by sheer force of will. But in the end I was conquered. A mist hung before <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and all sound died away. I fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|And I slept {{wondering}} as <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> whence Ayesha drew {{this strange}} confidence and comfort. I know not {{but it was}} there, real and not assumed. I can only suppose therefore that some illumination had fallen on her soul, and that, as she stated, the love and end of Leo in a way unknown, did suffice to satisfy her court of sins.|$|E
60|$|And {{to think}} that this was my fault--the result of my own {{reckless}} neglect. I had grown so used to sitting back dozing in my shroud in the dentist's chair, listening to the twittering of the birds outside, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> in the sweet half sleep of perfect security, that the old apprehensiveness and mental agony had practically all gone.|$|E
60|$|One night I {{was lying}} with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and to, all {{appearance}} sound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself without making the slightest sound. I {{could not imagine}} {{what she was going}} to do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her. When she was fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room.|$|E
60|$|My {{method of}} {{mechanical}} hypnosis was {{the soul of}} simplicity. Sitting with folded legs on my straw-mattress, I gazed fixedly at a fragment of bright straw which I had attached {{to the wall of}} my cell near the door where the most light was. I gazed at the bright point, with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> to it, and tilted upward till they strained to see. At the same time I relaxed all the will of me and gave myself to the swaying dizziness that always eventually came to me. And when I felt myself sway out of balance backward, I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and permitted myself to fall supine and unconscious on the mattress.|$|R
6000|$|Had I a cave on {{some wild}} distant shore, [...] Where the winds howl to the wave's dashing roar: [...] There would I weep my woes, [...] There seek my lost repose, [...] Till grief <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> should <b>close,</b> [...] Ne'er to wake more! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get thee to bed, lass," [...] he {{said when}} he had concluded. [...] "I'll sit up an' read the word. <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> could not <b>close</b> this night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now the {{sensible}} {{thing to do}} is to stop the narrator right at this point. Say to him quietly and firmly, [...] "Yes, I have heard that story. I always liked it ever since it came out in Tit Bits in 1878, and I read it every time I see it. Go on and tell it to me and I'll sit back with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and enjoy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Shultz stalked up to {{the plate}} I shut my eyes a moment, and so still was it that the field and stands might have been empty. Yet, though I tried, I could not keep <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> I opened them to watch the Rube. I knew Spears felt the same as I, for he was blowing like a {{porpoise}} and muttering to himself: [...] "Mebee the Rube won't last an' I've no one to put in!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled on}} a pair of mittens, put on his cap, and ascended the companion-stairs, while I {{followed}} his suggestion by going to bed. For some unknown reason, prompted mysteriously, I did not undress, but lay down fully clothed. For a time I listened to the clamour in the steerage and marvelled upon the love which had come to me; but my sleep on the Ghost had become most healthful and natural, and soon the songs and cries died away, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and my consciousness sank down into the half-death of slumber.|$|E
60|$|The dervish {{took the}} box I had {{extended}} to him, and, bidding me shut <b>my</b> left <b>eye,</b> touched it gently with the ointment. When I opened it again I saw spread out, {{as it were}} before me, treasures of every kind and without number. But as all this time I had been obliged to keep <b>my</b> right <b>eye</b> <b>closed,</b> which was very fatiguing, I begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you remember, Jinny," [...] he cried, [...] "one {{day long}} ago when those Dutch ruffians were teasing you and Anne on the road, and Bert Russell and Jack and I came along? We whipped 'em, Jinny. And <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> was <b>closed.</b> And you were bathing it here, {{and one of my}} buttons was gone. And you counted the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Truth was, <b>my</b> outward <b>eyes</b> were <b>closed,</b> [...] Although I did {{not know}} it; Deep into dream-land I had dozed, And thus was happily {{transposed}} [...] From proser into poet. [...] 30 ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stood for}} a long time on the terrace, {{sometimes}} looking into the darkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse of her; sometimes with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> so that I might recall and hold in my mind her passage down the steps. For the first time since I had met her she had thrown back at me a glance as she stepped on the white path below the terrace. With the glamour over me of that look, which was all love and enticement, I could have dared all the powers that be.|$|E
60|$|They bandied {{such talk}} between them, and {{occasionally}} Bill chimed {{in with a}} joke. Greaser ate in morose silence. There {{must have been something}} on his mind. Buell took very little dinner, and appeared to be in pain. It was dark when the meal ended. Bud bound me up for the night, and he made a good job of it. My arm burned and throbbed, but not badly enough to prevent sleep. Twice I had nearly dropped off when loud laughs or voices roused me. <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> with a picture of those rough, dark men sitting before the fire.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight of}} the dark-looking hole in the door quickly sobered me down. All was quiet, however, but on {{entering}} my room, there was a strangeness in the air, and that not due to my landlady's forlorn trumpetings from above. Through the floating vaporous light I trod across to my staircase and was soon in bed. Hardly had <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> when there broke out of the gloom around me a dismal, appalling cry. I soon realized that the creeping horror this caused in me was as nothing {{compared with that of}} the poor beast, lured, no doubt, into the house by Henry, at finding itself beneath a strange roof.|$|E
60|$|How long I slept after <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>closed</b> in uneasy slumber, it is {{impossible}} for me to say; but looking back at the matter afterward I fancied at least three hours had passed since we entered this cellar, when the sound of loud voices in the room above brought the four of us to our feet as if moved by a single spring of steel.|$|R
5000|$|... "When <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> are <b>closed,</b> I'm {{thinking}} and when <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> are open, I'm creating" [...] David Kracov {{was born in}} 1968 in Boston, Massachusetts. At the age of 12, after winning first place in an art competition, {{he became one of}} the youngest artists ever to be showcased in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. After receiving a degree from the Rhode Island School of Design, Kracov moved to Los Angeles in order to pursue a career in animation.|$|R
5000|$|In Secret Sexualities, Ian McCormick {{notes the}} inter-relationship {{of public and}} private, and of the open and the secret, as {{features}} that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; {{but then it was}} so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>close,</b> I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' ...|$|R
