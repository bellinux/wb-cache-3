25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the TV program Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters premiered on NBC. In {{addition}} to hosts Barbara, Louise, and Irlene, the show featured musical guests and comedy sketches. Each broadcast also {{closed with a}} gospel song, which led to Mandrell recording her own inspirational album, He Set <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> Music (1982). As {{a result of her}} busy schedule, she began suffering from vocal strain, and on doctor's orders, pulled the plug on the television program in 1982. (Variety shows were also falling out of favor at the time; the series was NBC's last variety series to date.) She received one award (People's Choice) and two nominations (Golden Globe and TV Land Award) for her work on the show. In 1983, she premiered The Lady Is a Champ, a Las Vegas stage show.|$|E

Donen has stated that he [...] "really cared about [...] and gave three years of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> it... I think it's a very good movie." [...] It went over budget and was unsuccessful at the box office. Most critics were unenthusiastic; however, Jay Cocks praised the film for having [...] "the glistening surface and full-throttle frivolity that characterized Hollywood films in the 1930s." ...|$|E
