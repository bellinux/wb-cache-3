40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies {{examining}} swine {{was to determine the}} sources of S. suis which colonize neonatal pigs; to determine the youngest age at which S. suis may be isolated from pigs; and, to evaluate <b>medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (MEW) as a preventive measure. Multiple samples were collected from pigs of all ages, their dams, and the environment. All collected samples were culturally examined for S. suis. Streptococcus suis isolates were serotyped and in some cases antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed. Multiple serotypes of S. suis were isolated from samples collected from individual pigs. Streptococcus suis was isolated from saliva, nasal secretions, feces, and the underline of the sow at farrowing and thereafter. Streptococcus suis was isolated from pig samples collected at birth, but was not isolated from samples collected from cesarean derived pigs. In many cases, S. suis of the same serotype isolated from samples collected from the dam were detected in samples from that dam 2 ̆ 7 s pig. Additionally, the pig was colonized with S. suis of the same subtype(s) carried by the sow as determined by genomic fingerprinting. These results indicated that the primary source of S. suis was the sow, and that S. suis colonized the surface and oral cavity of the pig during the birth process when the pig contacted and swallowed infected sow vaginal secretions. Moreover, the pig was continually exposed to S. suis following birth when it contacted S. suis from sow excretions and secretions. <b>Medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> of pigs with penicillin, ampicillin, or ceftiofur sodium failed to eliminate the tonsillar carrier state of S. suis. The use of antimicrobial susceptibility testing on herd isolates of S. suis is recommended due to the variability in sensitivity between isolates. Optimization of management and environment of pigs, coupled with strategic medication of clinically ill animals is recommended for control and prevention of mortality caused by streptococcosis. The {{purpose of the}} human study was to determine if people in Indiana were carriers of S. suis and at risk of contracting streptococcosis or infecting the pigs with which they worked. Human S. suis carriers were not identified. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostics}} of porcine {{respiratory disease}} complex (PRDC) requires a complex investigation with compulsory {{use of a}} serological assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA). The poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) assay is also {{becoming more and more}} important. Prevention plays an essential role for eradication of this disease complex. The treatment with antibiotics is less important. The control measures should be complex and are mainly focused on restriction and hygiene. They include parent herds ’ closure, schedules for early weaning of piglets (segregated or <b>medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning),</b> the all-in/all-out management technology, periodical serological surveys etc. Vaccinations result in relatively weak effect against the main PRDC agents. The use of live vaccines in PRRSV interferes with the diagnostics and generates a risk of virulentization of the vaccinal strain whereas killed vaccines are not sufficiently immunogenic and therefore also impede diagnostics. The weak immunity in Mycoplasma infections is mainly due to the epithelial localization of pathogens, that makes them hardly accessible for host immune defense. The non-specific prevention is also prevailing for control of other bacterial agents of PRDC.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the impact of immune system (IS) activation on the rate, efficiency, and composition of growth, efficiency of nutrient utilization, and lysine needs of growing pigs. The use of a <b>medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> scheme resulted in elimination of pathogenic antigens present in the herd of origin of pigs as measured by serological evaluation of prevalent antigens. This decrease in pathogenic antigen level resulted in a decreased level of IS activation {{as defined by the}} criteria of decreased CD:CD ratio and decreased serum alpha- 1 acylglycoprotein concentrations. The differences in both CD 4 :CD 8 ratio and serum alpha- 1 acylglycoprotein were evident throughout the stages of pig development evaluated in this study, indicating that chronic differences in IS activation existed and were persistent throughout the duration of pig development. Minimizing activation of the immune system via minimizing pathogenic antigen exposure resulted in increased (P. 15) the partial efficiency of L utilization for proteinaceous tissue deposition, the partial efficiencies of energy utilization for protein or fat deposition, or daily maintenance needs. Due to the increase in proteinaceous tissue growth, minimizing IS activation increased dietary L needs by. 15 to. 30 % and daily L needs by 2 to 6 grams per day and these effects were consistent throughout pig development. Thus, minimizing IS activation via management schemes increases proteinaceous tissue growth and due to this enhanced rate of growth, increases lysine needs (% and grams/day) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{years of}} bracing {{represent}} {{a burden to}} the patients. <b>Early</b> <b>weaning</b> {{may be the result}} of poor compliance, but may also be planned in patients with a long expected treatment time and a reduced stable primary curve during bracing. The aim of the present cohort study was to compare curve size, health related quality of life and surgical rates at long-term follow-up after ordinary bracing, planned and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning.</b> Methods: Three hundred eighty-one patients (353 girls/ 28 boys) with late-onset juvenile (n = 30) and adolescent (n = 351) idiopathic scoliosis and a mean primary major curve of 33. 1 (range 20 – 57) ° were treated with Boston brace and followed prospectively. Results: Ordinary brace treatment was completed in 290 (76 %) patients, planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> at bone age < 14 years in 59 (16 %), and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> in 32 (8 %), while 14 (5 %), 1 (2 %), and 12 (38 %) had surgery, respectively. Forty-eight (81 %) of the patients had a primary curve ≤ 25 ° at planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning.</b> Six-teen (27 %) of those who had planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> resumed bracing after a mean time of 2. 0 years. The mean curve size at long-term follow-up in average 23. 4 years after weaning, was smaller (p < 0. 001) in patients with planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (25. 1 °) compared with ordinary bracing (34. 0 °) and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (34. 8 °).

40|$|Summary: We {{attempted}} to eradicate porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus using early weaning and two-site production. We chose this method over depopulation or test-and removal procedures because the infection was highly {{prevalent in the}} breeding herd (63 %), the breeding herd was very valuable (a seedstock operation), and because another farm was concurrently available. Modified <b>medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (at 14 days) was also {{used to try to}} eradicate other chronic respiratory diseases detected in the herd. Samples taken from pigs raised on-site were positive by indirect-ffuorescent antibody (IFA) assay. Animals tested at the offsite facility (90 head) were negative by IFA for 4 months, but then infection occurred. PRRSvirus was isolated from one pig in the nursery and allpigs tested were seropositiveto PRRSvirus. The source of the viruswas thought to be a carrier pig. No evidence of pneumonia was detected at slaughter, and this observation in conjunction with a lack of clinical signs indicated that in this high health herd, PRRSinfection was subclinical. Five to 6 months after infection, IFA titers in 5 - to 6 -month-old pigs decreased from 1024 to undetectable (0 - 16) over 5 months. Nursery pigs were seronegative at weaning and seroconverted to PRRSvirus at 8 - 10 weeks of age. Because the nursery appeared to be the area where virus was recirculating, we {{attempted to}} eradicate PRRSby depopulating the nursery. After normal pig ffow resumed, all pigs tested have remained negativefor PRRSantibody...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Streptococcus suis is a {{commensal}} organism {{that can}} occasionally cause outbreaks of meningitis, endocarditis, and/ or arthritis. Isolation of S. suis from respiratory sites is common {{and should be}} disregarded, as these strains tend to be nonvirulent. Isolation from {{the central nervous system}} is best achieved by obtaining cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and using this sample for blood agar plating and Gram stains. Alternatively, a swab can be inserted through the foramen magnum into the sub-meningeal space. SerotYPing ofS. suis is only clinicallyuseful when a federally licensed vaccine is to be employed as part of the control strategy. Streptococcus suis is a common organism of the nasal cavity of pigs. It is so prevalent that experiments with <b>medicated</b> <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> show S. suis colonizing baby pigs before 10 days of age. 1 Diagnosing S. suis based on laboratory results can be tricky, because many isolations lack pathological significance. Clinical signs I recognize only central-nervous-system (CNS) signs, endocarditis, or arthritis as being indisputably due to S. suis. CNS signs include head tilting, circling, ataxia, and even paddling. Arthritis is usually manifested as an enlarged joint, often with purulent exudate. Many have claimed that S. suis is involved in respiratory lesions, but this has never been adequately proven. I believe that S. suis is rarely, if ever, involved in pneumonia or other respiratory conditions, except perhaps in the very rare case of fully susceptible pigs. Isolating S. suis from lungs is very common, and can be routinely achieved with care. However, pigs experimentally infected with S. suis do not develop respiratory lesions. 2 In addition, using DNAfingerprinting, 3 we found that while CNSisolates from the Midwestwere relatively similar to each other, respiratory isolates were very heterogeneous, suggesting that {{they are part of the}} normal flora and do not get involved in disease. Virulence factors in these strains are another source of proof that S. suis is not involved in respiratory lesions. Two proteins, MRPand EF,have been shown to be associated with virulenc...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{clinical}} onset {{and severity}} of intestinal disorders in humans and animals can be profoundly impacted by early life stress. Here we investigated the impact of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> stress in pigs on intestinal physiology, clinical disease, and immune response to subsequent challenge with enterotoxigenic F 18 E. coli (ETEC). Methodology: Pigs weaned from their dam at 16 d, 18 d, and 20 d of age were given a direct oral challenge of F 18 ETEC at 26 d of age. Pigs were monitored from days 0 to 4 post-infection for clinical signs of disease. On Day 4 post-ETEC challenge, ileal barrier function, histopathologic and inflammatory cytokine analysis were performed on ileal mucosa. Results: <b>Early</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs (16 d and 18 d weaning age) exhibited a more rapid onset {{and severity of}} diarrhea and reductions in weight gain in response to ETEC challenge compared with late weaned pigs (20 d weaning age). ETEC challenge induced intestinal barrier injury in <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs, indicated by reductions in ileal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and elevated FD 4 flux rates, in <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> pig ileum but not in late weaned pigs.

40|$|Behaviour {{problems}} {{are common in}} companion felines, and problematic behaviour {{may be a sign}} of chronic stress. In laboratory animals, <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> increases the risk for aggression, anxiety, and stereotypic behaviour. However, very few studies have focused on <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> in one of the world's most popular pets, the domestic cat, although weaning soon after the critical period of socialisation is common practice. To study the effects of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (< 12 weeks) on behaviour, a large data set (N = 5726, 40 breeds) was collected from home-living domestic cats through a questionnaire survey. The results show that weaning before 8 weeks of age increases the risk for aggression, but not fearful behaviour. Moreover, cats weaned after 14 weeks of age have a lower probability for aggression towards strangers than <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> cats and a lower probability for stereotypic behaviour (excessive grooming) than cats weaned at 12 weeks. The effect of weaning age on stereotypic behaviour is partially explained by the effects on aggression.

Cows were assigned to winter feeding groups and fed one of two amounts of a common soybean meal-milo supplement (45 % crude protein; dry matter basis). The two supplementation amounts were fed three times weekly and were prorated to 4 lb/day and 2. 8 lb/day. The four treatment groups were: 1) <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> – 4 lb/day supplement, 2) <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> – 2. 8 lb/day supplement, 3) fall weaning – 4 lb/day supplement, and 4) fall weaning – 2. 8 lb/day supplement. Cows were supplemented from November 14, 2003, through calving in early March 2004. Cows with calves <b>weaned</b> <b>early</b> were initially heavier and had higher initial body condition scores than did cows that were weaned in the fall. Although losses of body weight and body condition through the winter were greater for early-weaning cows than for fall-weaning cows, final body weights and body condition scores were still greater for the early-weaning cows than for the fall-weaning cows. Supplementation with 4 lb/day led to less body weight loss over the winter and heavier final body weights than did supplementation with 2. 8 lb/day, but final body condition score and body condition score loss over the winter were not affected by the amount of winter supplementation. Cow-calf producers can balance responses to <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> and to winter supplementation to target appropriate cow weights and body condition scores at calving...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> and concentrate supplementation on performance and metabolic profile of lambs in four production systems on pasture: suckling lambs not supplemented until slaughter; suckling lambs supplemented with concentrate in creep feeding until slaughter; <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> lambs not supplemented until slaughter; <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> lambs supplemented with concentrate until slaughter. Performance was assessed by average daily gain (ADG) and body condition score (BCS) measurements. Metabolic profile was delineated by measuring serum albumin, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase. Weaning reduced ADG by 92 g/d and the ADG for weaned and suckling lambs were 113 g/d and 205 g/d, respectively. Supplementation increased ADG by 117 g/d and the ADG was 99 g/d for non-supplemented and 216 g/d for supplemented lambs. Body weight and BCS at the end of trial were lower in weaned and non-supplemented animals (20. 7 kg and 1. 5 points), and higher in those on creep feeding (35. 3 kg and 3. 3 points). Weaning decreased serum levels of albumin, cholesterol and aspartate aminotransferase. Supplementation increased serum albumin and decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase. Serum urea was not affected by weaning or supplementation and remained high during the trial. Serum creatinine and glucose were lower in weaned and non-supplemented lambs. <b>Early</b> <b>weaning</b> generates unsuitable metabolic profile and low performance and may not be recommended as single strategy to produce lambs on pasture. Concentrate supplementation has similar response to suckling on the performance and metabolic profile of animals, and may be considered an efficient strategy to improve the nutritional status of <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> lambs...|$|R

40|$|Management {{and feeding}} {{strategies}} for <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> of rabbits. Under commercial conditions, litters are usually {{separated from their}} mothers at around 35 days of age or even later {{in order to increase}} weight at weaning {{on the basis of the}} positive correlation with post-weaning viability observed in previous research. Recent studies, however, have proposed anticipating weaning age for the dual purpose of reducing doe energy output for milk production and consequent body energy deficit and providing better coverage for kit nutritional requirements through the administration of specific starter diets. Previous studies have demonstrated that the <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> of rabbits has no detrimental effects on health or growth performance when performed from 21 d onwards and is compatible with the behaviour of wild rabbits. <b>Early</b> <b>weaning</b> has been observed to improve doe body condition and energy balance by decreasing the lactation period and increasing the dry period. In highly productive hybrid rabbits however, the sudden interruption of lactation at its peak may compromise reproductive performance in an extent that needs to be further investigated. Animal welfare may present another critical point against <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> even if survival is guaranteed whenever kits can easily access water and food. Specific starter diets appear useful in stimulating digestive functions and microflora development, although studies have shown that kits can be successfully <b>weaned</b> at an <b>early</b> stage regardless of the weaning diet adopted. Current knowledge on protein, fibre and fibrous fractions, starch and fat supply appears sufficient for the formulation of starter diets for <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> rabbit. However, the complete comprehension of digestive physiology development in this condition and its relationship with digestive efficiency and health requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> on circadian rhythm and the behavioral satiety sequence in adult rats. Male Wistar rat pups were weaned for separation from the mother at 15 (D 15), 21 (D 21) and 30 (D 30) days old. Body weight and food intake was measured every 30 days until pups were 150 days old. At 90 days of age, the circadian rhythm of food intake was evaluated every 4 h for three days. Behavioral satiety was evaluated at 35 and 100 days of age. This work demonstrated that body weight and food intake were not altered, but the behavioral satiety sequence demonstrated that the D 15 group delayed satiety compared with the D 30 group at 100 days of age. In the circadian rhythm of the food intake study, <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (D 15) changed food intake in the intermediary period of the light phase and in the intermediary period of the dark phase. In conclusion, our study showed that <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> may alter the feeding behavior mainly in relation to satiety and the circadian rhythm of feeding. It {{is possible that the}} presence of other environmental stimuli during <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> can cause hyperphagia and deregulate the mechanisms of homeostasis and body weight control. This study supports theories that depict insults during early life as determinants of chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{development}} of the gastrointestinal tract depends on many elements, including glucocorticoids. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> on corticosterone function {{and the growth of}} rat gastric mucosa. Methods: By using Wistar rats submitted to <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> at 15 d, we analyzed plasma corticosterone, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) distribution in the gastric epithelium. Results: With the use of radioimmunoassay, we found that <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> increased corticosterone concentration at day 16 and 17 in test subjects as compared with controls, whereas it was equivalent between groups at day 18. CBG binding capacity decreased during treatment, and it was significantly lower at day 18. At this age, GR levels and distribution in the gastric mucosa were also reduced as compared with suckling counterparts. To reduce corticosterone activity during <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> and to explore cell proliferation responses, we administered RU 486 to 15 -d-old pups. We found that cytoplasmic GR reached a peak after 48 h, whereas nuclear levels remained constant, thereby confirming the inhibition of receptor function. Next, by checking gastric proliferative responses, we observed that RU 486 induced higher DNA synthesis and mitotic indices in test subjects as compared with control groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> changed corticosterone activity by increasing hormone levels, reducing CBG binding capacity, and decreasing GR distribution in the gastric epithelium. These modifications seem to be important to the reorganization of gastric growth after the abrupt interruption of suckling.
