500|$|Biographers have characterised Pick {{as being}} [...] "very shy", and [...] "brilliant but lonely". Christian Barman {{described}} {{him as a person}} who inspired conflicting opinions about his personality and his actions: [...] "a man about whom so many people held so many different views". Pick acknowledged that he could be difficult to work with: [...] "I have always kept in <b>mind</b> <b>my</b> own frailties – a short temper. Impatience with fools, quickness rather than thoroughness. I am a bad hand at the gracious word or casual congratulation." [...] His moralistic character led to friends giving him the nickname [...] "Jonah". Pick valued criticism and savoured challenging debate, though he complained that he found it difficult to get people to stand up to him. UERL board member Sir Ernest Clark considered Pick to be perhaps too efficient and unable to fully delegate and relinquish responsibility: [...] "his own efficiency has a bad effect on the efficiency of others... How can the housemaid take pride in a job to which the mistress will insist on putting the finishing touch?" [...] Pick's friend Noel Carrington thought that his attention to detail made him the [...] "ideal inspector general." ...|$|E

500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, but never <b>mind</b> <b>my</b> leg: take care of my flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E

2500|$|Marcus {{probably}} {{began his}} {{education at the}} age of seven. He was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends; Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools. Three of his childhood tutors are known: Euphoric, Geminus, and an unnamed educator. These three are otherwise unattested in the ancient sources, and would probably have been household slaves or freedmen. Since Euphoric had a Greek name, he probably taught Marcus the basics of that language. (He is said to have taught Marcus literature.) Geminus is described as an actor, and he may have taught Marcus Latin pronunciation and general elocution. The educator would have been Marcus' overall supervisor, charged with his moral welfare and general development. Marcus speaks of him with admiration in his Meditations: he taught him to [...] "bear pain and be content with little; to work with my own hands, to <b>mind</b> <b>my</b> own business, to be slow to listen to slander".|$|E
2500|$|Celine Dion {{said while}} {{introducing}} him during her Christmas Special for These Are Special Times, in 1998, that [...] "if God {{would have a}} singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli," [...] and David Foster, a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world. Similarly, Jazz singer, Al Jarreau, who performed with Bocelli on the [...] "Night of the Proms" [...] tour in Europe, in 1995, described him as [...] "the most beautiful voice in the world," [...] and American talk show host Oprah Winfrey commented on her talk show that, [...] "when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears." [...] After attending Bocelli's concert at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor said, [...] "My <b>mind,</b> <b>my</b> soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being. God has kissed this man and I thank God for it." [...] Taylor had been a passionate fan of Bocelli's {{since the beginning of}} his music career in the mid-1990s. Other fans include Prince Albert of Monaco, who invited the tenor to sing at his wedding, as well as Sarah, Duchess of York, and actress Isabella Rossellini.|$|E

2500|$|The 35th {{and final}} frame lasted 68 minutes. In that frame Davis led 62–44, {{with only the}} last four [...] on the table, worth 22 points. Taylor stayed in {{contention}} by potting a very difficult brown from long range, followed by a tricky blue and pink. This meant that, for the first time, the title would be decided on the very last ball, the black. Taylor tried to double it into the left middle pocket; he missed, but the ball rebounded to a safe position {{at the top of}} the table. Davis then played an excellent safety shot, putting the black near the middle of the baulk (bottom) cushion and leaving the cue ball near the right-hand cushion, a little above the corner pocket. Taylor then half-attempted to double the black into the top-left corner pocket but missed, with the black rebounding up and down the table, eventually sneaking past the left middle pocket to a relatively safe position. As the applause died down from the audience, veteran commentator Ted Lowe remarked, [...] "I'm sure Dennis wouldn't <b>mind</b> <b>my</b> saying he chanced his arm, and it's come out lucky". Davis's next attempt went awry, as a double-kiss left Taylor with a reasonable middle-distance pot to the green corner pocket. However, he snatched somewhat at the shot and missed the pot ("the biggest shot of his life", as commentator Jim Meadowcroft described it). Taylor thought, in his disappointment, that he had left Davis a moderately easy cut on the black into the top pocket from fairly close range. However, that pot was at a thinner angle than Taylor had anticipated as he tried to judge where the balls would finish up.|$|E
