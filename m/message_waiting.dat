50|$|Channels may be {{synchronous}} or asynchronous. In {{the case}} of a synchronous channel, the agent sending a <b>message</b> <b>waits</b> until another agent has received the message. Asynchronous channels do not require any such synchronization. In some process calculi (notably the π-calculus) channels themselves can be sent in messages through (other) channels, allowing the topology of process interconnections to change.

30|$|In {{this type}} of protocols, the {{decision}} of whether to rebroadcast a message or not depends on {{the distance between the}} transmitter and the receiver. Hence, only the vehicles located at a distance greater than a given threshold rebroadcast the message. These protocols are highly dependent on the threshold, which often causes a variable performance. In [25], the authors propose a protocol where the vehicles attempting to retransmit a <b>message</b> <b>wait</b> t seconds, where t depends on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver {{as well as on the}} communication range. In [26], a protocol that selects the relay by partitioning the communication range is proposed; here, the vehicle located in the farthest partition retransmits the message.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) systems offer a {{solution}} for broadband access and high data rate transmission of multimedia services with distinct Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements through a wireless medium. IEEE 802. 16 Standard specifies the PHY and MAC layers for BWA systems. However, in spite of including the possibility for QoS support, the standard does not define how to schedule different types of traffic. This article propose a new MAC protocol for BWA systems that incorporates a traffic scheduling mechanism based on messages and/or stations priorities. An analytical model to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed protocol is also developed and results obtained for the <b>messages</b> <b>waiting</b> times of different traffic classes are presented.

5000|$|This {{service is}} often erroneously {{associated}} with the abilities of most Caller ID standalone set-top boxes. Caller ID boxes manufactured after 1998 feature an LED that blinks green to notify that new calls have been recorded and red to indicate that a subscriber has new voicemail <b>messages</b> <b>waiting.</b> Some units also display the text [...] "MESSAGE WAITING" [...] (similar to ADSI-compliant telephones). These units do not use visual FSK to activate their red LEDs, but instead, they briefly [...] "pick-up" [...] the line at certain intervals (normally, within two minutes of a new call) to check for a [...] "stuttered" [...] dial tone. The presence of a stutter dial tone activates a red LED; while absence deactivates it.|$|R

Messages were retrieved from page *930#, where they were presented to the recipient in chronological order. After reading a new message, the user had to choose between deleting the message, or saving it, before the next message was presented. Initially only three messages could be saved at any one time, and these stored messages were accessible via page *931#.|$|R
5000|$|ROLM Corporation, {{founded in}} 1969 by Gene Richeson, Ken Oshman, Walter Loewenstern and Robert Maxfield, {{was the first}} PBX {{manufacturer}} to offer integrated voice-mail with its PhoneMail system, its registered trademark. PhoneMail offered impressive recording quality of its digitized messages. ROLM's digital PBX (called a CBX, for Computerized Branch eXchange) {{was the first to}} enable PhoneMail to illuminate a <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> light on ROLM phones equipped with <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> lights (also a stutter dialtone is used with analog and digital phones). Rolm was sold to IBM, who later sold it to Siemens who offer PhoneMail in various configurations/sizes (including a micro-sized version) and its unified messaging successor, Xpressions 470. ROLM was purchased by IBM in the mid 1980s (which was a financial disaster for the profitable ROLM, as IBM clearly could not grasp the laid back, [...] "think outside the box" [...] attitude of ROLM, which was the #2 PBX supplier in the US from the mid 70s to late 80s), then sold half interest to the German company Siemens. In 1992, Siemens bought ROLM entirely from IBM and the original ROLM product line was done for, except for PhoneMail (the only product Siemens did not destroy). VMX suffered from poor product and ineffective management and was about to fold when Opcom merged with it. The surviving company was called VMX, but VMX was all but erased by Opcom except for its name and patent portfolio.|$|E
50|$|This {{feature is}} also {{frequently}} called (and abbreviated) as visual <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> indicator (VMWI). A VMWI, {{as defined in}} Telcordia GR-1401-CORE, is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a visual indicator on customer-premises equipment (CPE) to notify the customer that new messages are waiting. VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered dial tone, in that it activates a visual indicator on the CPE. The visual indicator may {{be as simple as}} lighting or flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a liquid-crystal display (LCD).|$|E

In Chicago, Illinois, they shot two matches, one at live birds and one at clay pigeons, Carver winning both matches. From there they traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, where they found a <b>message</b> <b>waiting</b> for them from the Ligowsky Clay Pigeon Company. If they used Ligowsky's clay pigeons, the company would award a $7500 purse for the series of 25 matches. The match using clay pigeons that they had already shot in Chicago was counted as one match, another match was shot {{while they were in}} St. Louis, and from there they traveled to 23 more cities. Carver won 19 of the 25 matches and secured his position as one of the world's best marksmen.|$|E

The system throughput, message response time, message delay-time distribution and message blocking probability are obtained. It {{is assumed that}} each message consists of a random number of packets with a general distribution, and each user have a finite buffer capacity. To maintain the fairness to all users, {{it is assumed that}} each message in the buffer is transmitted independently that is, a user has to release the reserved slot after finishing the transmission of a message even if it has more <b>messages</b> <b>waiting</b> in the buffer. The analysis can be extended to R-ALOHA systems with infinite buffer capacity straightforwardly. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by simulations...|$|R

5000|$|When the VMSC/SGSN {{indicates}} a Short Message delivery failure, the SMSC may {{send a message}} to the HLR, using the MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS procedure, indicating the reason for the delivery failure and requesting that the SMSC be put on a list of service centres wanting to be notified when the destination party becomes available again. The HLR will set a flag against the destination account, indicating that it is unavailable for short message delivery, and store the SMSC's address in the <b>Message</b> <b>Waiting</b> Data (MWD) list for the destination party. Valid flags are Mobile Not Reachable Flag (MNRF), Memory Capacity Exceeded Flag (MCEF) and Mobile Not Reachable for GPRS (MNRG). The HLR will now start responding to SRI-for-SM requests with a failure, indicating the failure reason, and will automatically add the requesting SMSC's address to the MWD list for the destination party.

40|$|A new message {{scheduling}} {{policy is}} proposed {{in this paper}} for delivering messages under deadline constraints. Unlike most existing work, this policy is intended for distributed systems with point-to-point interconnection topology. It is first shown that commonly used scheduling criteria like Earliest-Deadline-First do not work well in point-to-point interconnection topologies. Therefore, in the proposed policy, the scheduling of messages at each node is based on minimizing {{an estimate of the}} cost that the system will incur due to messages at that node missing their deadlines. The proposed policy can be implemented using an algorithm that has O(n) worst-case complexity, where n is number of <b>messages</b> <b>waiting</b> for transmission when a new message arrives. A modification that limits this worst-case complexity to O(B) where B is fixed constant is also proposed. Simulation results indicate that fewer messages miss their deadline in the proposed policy as compared to other policies...|$|R
