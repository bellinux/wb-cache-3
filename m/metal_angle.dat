40|$|A {{model of}} the {{spanwise}} variation of deviation for stator blades is presented. Deviation {{is defined as the}} difference between the passage mean flow angle and the <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> at the outlet of a blade element of an axial compressor stage. The variation of deviation is taken as the difference above or below that predicted by blade element, (i. e., two-dimensional) theory at any spanwise location. The variation of deviation is dependent upon the blade camber, solidity and inlet boundary layer thickness at the hub or tip end-wall, and the blade channel aspect ratio. If these parameters are known or can be calculated, the model provides a reasonable approximation of the spanwise variation of deviation for most compressor middle stage stators operating at subsonic inlet Mach numbers...|$|E

Geometrical optics approach and the approximation of continuous electrodynamics are used for the analysis.

Loss estimation systems are still beneficial {{in the early stages of}} steam path design. A number of loss models for estimating turbine performance have been published over the past few decades. However, there have been surprisingly large deviations among them. They do not reflect the aerodynamic improvements towards modern blade design such as spline design and do not recognize the detailed refinements of the blade passage shape such as front loading and aft loading. In addition, it is not easy to set up new or modified methods in the loss models because it is necessary to have large quantity of test data. To establish a new loss estimation system, a method is presented for a turbine cascade blade operating in subsonic regions where the exit Mach number <= 0. 8. A prediction method based on entropy generation is developed to analyze the loss mechanism for the cascade blade. In the profile loss model, the basic profile loss model is induced from isentropic Mach number distribution along the blade surface. The trailing edge thickness loss model was introduced from CFD results and experimental data. In the secondary loss model, a correlation model for different geometries (aspect ratio, deflection angle and contraction ratio) is developed from validated CFD methods compared to the measurements. In addition, inlet loss and downstream loss are derived using the concept of boundary layer and entropy generation respectively. To acquire a Reynolds number correction curve, the performance of blade profiles is examined with three linear cascade blades which represent hub, mid-span and tip sections using numerical analysis. The Reynolds number is varied from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 to capture the operating regime for typical steam turbines. Twelve different levels of surface roughness on the same profile are calculated using the roughness model in ANSYS-CFX. The ratios of surface roughness to chord length are in the range of k_sc= 4. 2 × 10 ^(- 5) ~ 8. 3 × 10 ^(- 4). The CFD result is compared to Reynolds number correction curves from published literature (AMDC-KO, Aungier, Craig & Cox, Traupel, Sanders and Denton) and available measurement data. Based on these comparisons, a Reynolds number correction curve is properly selected and newly correlated for the estimation of steam turbine performance. In addition, CFD results show that the proposed correlation for the Reynolds number, including roughness effects, can be adopted in both profile loss and secondary loss. The effect of an off-design incidence angle on the aerodynamic profile loss is examined experimentally with linear cascade blades which represent the hub, mid-span and tip sections. The cascade test covers a range of incidence angles from - 20 deg to + 20 deg. The results are evaluated with two existing kinds of incidence loss models (multiplier methods Ainley & Mathieson, Chen, Zehner / adder methods Stepanov, MK, MKT, BSM) and available measurement data (Zehner, Aronov, Hodson and Yamamoto). Based on these comparisons, it was found that the existing incidence model give quite good estimates in the mid-span profiles but there are some differences in the tip profile with a high inlet <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> and the hub profile with a low inlet <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> due to the different inlet geometry shape and a lack of data when developing the published models.

In this article, the turbine runner parameters that affect the performance and cavitation characteristics of designed turbines are examined in detail. Furthermore, turbines are custom designed according to the properties of hydroelectric power plants; this makes the design process even more challenging, as the rotational speed, runner geometry, system head and flow rate vary for each turbine. The effects of the design parameters are examined for four different turbine runners specifically designed and used in actual power plants in order to obtain general results and generalizations applicable to turbine design aided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The flow behavior, flow angles, head losses, pressure distribution, and cavitation characteristics are computed, analyzed, and compared. To assist hydraulic designers, the general influences of these parameters on the performance of turbines are summarized and empirical formulations are derived for runner performance characterization...|$|E

In this work, detailed data taken within a four and one-half stage large low-speed compressor were used to assess the weaknesses and strengths of the predictive capabilities of the average passage flow model. The low-speed compressor blading is of modern design and employs stator end-bends. Measurements were made with slow- and high response instrumentation. The high-response measurements revealed the velocity components of both the rotor and stator wakes. From the measured wake profiles, we found that the flow exiting the rotors deviated from the rotor exit <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> to a lesser degree than was predicted by the average passage flow model. This was found to be due to blade boundary layer transition, which recently has been shown to exist on multistage axial compressor rotor and stator blades, but was not accounted for in the average passage model. Consequently, a model that mimics the effects of blade boundary layer transition, Shih k-epsilon model, was incorporated into the average passage model. Simulations that incorporated this transition model showed a dramatic improvement in agreement with data. The altered model thus improved predictive capability for multistage axial-flow compressors, and this was verified by detailed experimental measurement...|$|E
40|$|This thesis quantifies the {{relative}} importance of the impeller outflow angle, Mach number, non-uniformity and unsteadiness on diffuser performance, through diffuser experiments in a compressor stage and in a swirling flow test rig combined with steady and unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes computations. The test article is a pressure ratio 5 tur-bocharger compressor with an airfoil vaned diffuser. The swirling flow rig is able to generate rotor outflow conditions representative of the compressor except for the periodic pitchwise unsteadiness, and ts a 0. 86 scale diffuser and volute. In both rigs, the time-mean impeller outflow is mapped across a diffuser pitch using miniaturized traversing probes developed for the purpose. Diffuser performance is well correlated to the average impeller outflow angle when the metric used is effectiveness, which describes the pressure recovery obtained relative to the maximum possible given the average inflow angle, Mach number and the vane exit <b>metal</b> <b>angle.</b> This is reflective of the strong mixing processes that occur in the diffuser inlet region. Utilizing effectiveness captures density changes through the diffuser at higher Mach numbers; a 10 % increase in pressure recovery is observed as the inlet Mach number is increased from 0. 5 to 1. Further, effectiveness is shown to be largely independent of the unsteady pitchwise non-uniformity from the rotor. The observed exception is for operating points with high time-averaged vane incidence. Here, it is hypothesized that excursions into high-loss flow regimes cause a non-linear increase in loss as large unsteady angle variations pass by from the rotor. Given that straight-channel diffuser design charts typically used in preliminary radial vaned diffuser design capture neither streamtube area changes from impeller exit to the diffuser throat nor vane incidence effects, their utility is limited. An alternative approach, utilizing effectiveness and vane leading edge incidence, is proposed. Finally, strong pressure fluctuations downstream of the diffuser vane leading edge, but not upstream, are strongly suggestive of a leading edge vortex previously proposed as the mechanism for short-wavelength stall inception. A preferential location for the stall onset is observed due to the circumferential pressure non-uniformity imposed by the volute. by Jonathan Everitt. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil diffuser assembly had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil diffuser assembly was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|E

Constructional system and materials used in them, most often accelerate these damages, so these are considered principal reasons of the events. Countries that have regions of high seismicity, conducted research on constructional systems, materials, and methods of improving their resistance to earthquake. These research efforts have found simple solution {{of the problem in}} wood and its proper combinations with other constructional materials. In this research, regarding such target, two subjects were studied. A model of light framed one story single-family residential house in Iran was constructed to determine its dynamical behavior. The model was constructed in one- third scale of a unit with 54 square meters in base. Foundation anchorage in model was made by <b>metal</b> <b>angle</b> pieces, which were bolted to lower plank. These types of connectors could easily be fabricated in metal working shops in Iran. The rest of joints in model were made with bolts and common nails. To see the behavior of the model, its natural frequency, acceleration at different points, lateral movements (displacement), and also response of joints to tensile and compressive forces (developed due to lateral dynamical loading on a shaking table) were measured and analyzed. Results have shown that with respect to Fast Fourier Transformation spectra, ratio of maximum acceleration in roof to bottom of model, in sinusoidal acceleration test, the natural frequency of model is ten HZ (fn = 10 Hz), since 10 Hz frequency has the highest amplitude. This result had contingency with data of sinusoidal acceleration records with 10 HZ frequency and 0. 64 g as well. Therefore, stiffness of model structure would be 78, 250 Kg/cm. In addition, results of several sinusoidal acceleration tests for determining delay damping, has shown on the average 0. 039 for this quantity. Brief results of sinusoidal acceleration test, sweeping frequency and time history of Kobe and Tabas earthquake have shown that maximum displacements (lateral movement due to dynamic loading) are related to this acceleration with 8 HZ frequency and 1. 18 g. This displacement in model has been measured 0. 76 mm, which is lower than allowable limit in IBC code (1 % of story high, that is, 30 mm for a 3 m high). Including scale coefficient of constructed model, this figure would be 5. 76 mm. But for force, it could be considered that highest tensile and compressive force would occur with 10 HZ frequency and 0. 85 g test. The cause is resonant phenomena in this frequency. Therefore, in resonant phenomena maximum force is applied to joints and in this case, each joint would be under load of 30 % of building’s weight. Therefore, well-installed joint can considerably prevent death and financial damages. financial losses.

Subsequently, a Pareto bi-objective optimisation is performed to unveil the relation between surge margin and cost for a given lower bound on aero-performance, as set by the initial study. The cost and surge margin {{are found to be}} highly opposing, since they require a minimisation and maximisation of the bladerow solidities, respectively. Three discrete families of designs are defined by the Pareto front, and the one closest to the standard 20 % surge margin requirement is chosen to proceed to the final multi-objective optimisation. The optimised design has a pressure ratio that is 4 % superior to the initial design, with the same level of efficiency. The surge margin is increased by 22 % to the required level of 20 %, whilst the cost is reduced by 24. 4 %. As well as outlining a successful methodology for integrated optimisation, the key inter-relation between stability and cost for a given performance is clearly elucidated. This establishes the need for more accurate methods of compressor dynamic stability prediction, which supersede the over-conservative surge-margin. Using these new metrics, operation a...|$|R

In this study we assessed the reliability of a tilting-board grip score {{as a measure of}} decompression sickness in rats. In experiments using a hyperbaric compression/decompression protocol, rats were observed for signs of decompression sickness and their grip strength measured on a tilting particle board hinged to a <b>metal</b> frame. <b>Angles</b> at which rats lost grip were converted to gravitational vectors. Decreasedmean grip scores following decompression were fitted to a logistic regressionmodel with strain, age, and weight. Decrease in grip score was significantly associated with observed decompression sickness...|$|R

Different theories of plates taking into account or neglect the transverse shear are presented and the obtained results by these theories are compared. Nonlinear higher-order strain-displacement relations were considered. Using the principle of potential energy, the critical buckling temperatures are determined. Finally, a parametric study {{of the influence of}} various parameters such as: aspect ratios: b/a and a/h, thickness of <b>metal,</b> fiber <b>angle</b> and stacking sequence on the critical buckling temperature is shown and discussed. Numerical results indicate that the addition of metal to a com-posite material and the consideration of the transverse shear deformation {{have a significant effect on}} the thermal buckling behavior of simply supported hybrid multilayer plates...|$|R

In some cases, the mirror-like surfaces create {{an illusion of}} transparency by showing reflections from unexpected sides of the structure. The sculpture's mathematician creator commented: When I saw the actual sculpture, I had quite a shock. I never imagined the play {{of light on the}} surfaces. There are subtle optical effects that you can feel but can't quite put your finger on.|$|R

An experimental investigation of the third quadrant (reverse rotation) performance, operation and the internal flow structures of a three stage subsonic axial flow compressor is described. The compressor used for this investigation has three repeating stages, and a design speed of 3000 rpm, a design mass flow rate of 2. 7 kg/s and a blade tip relative Mach number of 0. 2 at design point. The non-dimensional third quadrant pressure rise and torque characteristics for this machine have previously been determined. The steady-state interblade row flow-field was experimentally obtained {{by means of a}} five-hole cobra-type pneumatic probe and time-dependent phenomena were resolved by means of a 50 μ diameter cylindrical constanttemperature hot-film sensor. The observed flow structures are compared with those observed in a single stage axial fan rotating in the reverse direction as described in literature. Flow within rotor blade passages is dominated by large areas of separated flow on the pressure surface of the blades. A large axial velocity gradient is observed in the radial direction, with velocities highest near the shroud. Third quadrant operation appears to be similar to stalled first quadrant operation. Separation was found to be less severe on the final stage rotor row, as this blade row functions as the inlet rotor row in this mode of operation, thus flow angles are less unsuited to blade <b>metal</b> <b>angles.</b> These results yield insight into the causes of the low maximum pressure rise and efficiency obtained for this operational mode for this machine, as well as the apparent lack of a stall point on the pressure characteristic obtained. vk 201...|$|R
