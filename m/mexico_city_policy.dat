5|$|Among the U.S. {{delegation}} to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman. In that capacity, Keyes negotiated {{the language of the}} <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> <b>Policy</b> to withhold federal funds from international organizations that support abortion. Additionally, Keyes fought against an Arab-backed UN resolution calling for investigation of Israeli settlements. The measure passed, 83–2, with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. voting against it. Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the U.S. at the 1985 Women's Conference in Nairobi.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th President {{took place on}} January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued {{executive}} orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> <b>Policy</b> prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.|$|E
5000|$|One study {{conducted}} in the mid-1980s of twelve urban areas around the world concluded that residents of <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> had {{the highest levels of}} cadmium in their blood. [...] The concentration of pollutants was impacting surrounding ecosystems, as well as residents in the area These impacts included birth defects and high levels of gastrointestinal disease. [...] Also in the 1980s, the Mexican government implemented various anti-pollution <b>policies</b> in <b>Mexico</b> <b>City.</b> These <b>policies</b> included vehicle emission inspections, introducing unleaded gasoline, and the installation of converters on vehicles to help reduce pollution created by buses and trucks. [...] Another study in Mexico determined that five million tons of contaminants were released into the atmosphere each year; ten times more than in the previous decade. Vehicles and industrial plants were found to be the main contributors of contaminants into the atmosphere. [...] As well, fecal matter becomes airborne in Mexico during the winter months, resulting in residents being diagnosed with a variety of respiratory illnesses.|$|R
40|$|Reflecting a {{more general}} {{regional}} trend {{in the rise of}} urban crime and violence throughout Latin America (IBRD 2008; Koonings and Kruijt 2007 a; Rotker 2002), since the mid 1990 s, <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> witnessed a "metropolization of crime" (Castillo 2008 : 181). Although official statistics indicate a tendential decline of reported crime rates since the late 1990 s, victimization studies question these statements (Alvarado 2007), and {{according to a recent study}} on urban insecurity in Mexico, 87 % of <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> residents feel unsafe in their <b>city,</b> ranking <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> at the top of all other large urban agglomerations in the country (ICESI 2008). As a result, according to local opinion polls, security issues have become the central concern for most of the <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> residents—and <b>policy</b> makers. Therefore, it seems undeniable that "[t]he single-most relevant issue on the urban agenda today is fear" (Castillo 2008 : 181). However, this development is not only a reflection of a perceived increase in crime. This situation is also closely related to serious problems regarding the <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> police forces, which include the lack of adequate human resources and training; high turnover rates; a lack of vocational ethics; deficient and outdated equipment; police corruption; the absence of a clear normative framework of action; and the direct participation of police agents in organized (and unorganized) crime, violence and human rights violations (Pansters and Castilo Berthier 2007; Piccato 2007; Silva 2007; Azaola 2006; Davis 2006; Naval 2006; López-Montiel 2000; Martínez Murguía 1999). Though the local police institutions have increasingly attracted attention from NGO activists and academic scholars, who have accumulated substantial knowledge regarding the problems of the local public security apparatuses, detailed empirical analysis of the daily encounters between police and the residents of <b>Mexico</b> <b>City,</b> which can be expected to be the principal setting where the abovementioned problems unfold, are still the exception...|$|R
2500|$|On {{his first}} day in office, President Bush {{implemented}} the <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> Policy; this <b>policy</b> required nongovernmental organizations receiving federal funds to agree not to perform abortions or to actively promote abortion {{as a method of}} family planning in other nations. [...] In 2002, President Bush signed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which extends legal protection to infants born alive after failed attempts at induced abortion. [...] Also in 2002, President Bush withdrew funding from the United Nations Population Fund based on a finding that UNPF's activities facilitated China's one-child-only/forced abortion policy. [...] In 2003, President Bush signed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act into law; that law was later upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Gonzales v. Carhart. [...] President Bush signed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (Laci and Conner's Law), which provides that a person who commits certain federal violent crimes and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury to, a fetus shall be guilty of a separate offense, whether or not the person knew the mother was pregnant or intended to harm the fetus.|$|R
25|$|Within {{minutes of}} taking {{the oath of office}} on January 20, Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order {{suspending}} last-minute regulations and executive orders pushed through by outgoing President George W. Bush. Some of the first actions of Obama's presidency focused on reversing measures taken by the Bush administration following the September 11 attacks. In his first week in office, Obama signed Executive Order 13492 suspending all ongoing proceedings of the Guantanamo military commissions and ordering the Guantanamo detention facility to be shut down within the year. Another order, Executive Order 13491, banned torture and other coercive techniques, such as waterboarding. Obama also issued an executive order placing tighter restrictions on lobbying in the White House, and rescinded the <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> <b>Policy,</b> which banned federal grants to international groups that provide abortion services or counseling.|$|E

5000|$|Compulsory {{or forced}} sterilizations and abortions may also {{occur in the}} context of {{population}} control policies.From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other. At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> population control <b>policies</b> came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies. [...] In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment conspiracy theories about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a racist agenda of eugenics, and of trying to reduce the African American birth rate in the U.S.|$|R
