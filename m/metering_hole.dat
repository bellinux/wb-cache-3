In the existing models of the direct rice seeder, the dry/wet seeds are drilled continuously at a higher seed rate than the recommended and without desired seed to seed spacing. It is observed that as the seed drum empties the seed rate obtained increases steadily and steeply at the end i. e. the uniformity in seed rate is not maintained through out its operation. Hence investigation was carried out to study the influence of the machine and operational parameters viz., drum shape, diameter of drum, diameter of seed <b>metering</b> <b>hole,</b> number of seed metering holes and forward speed of operation on seed rate of the rice drum seeder in the laboratory condition.

50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air valve plates above the secondary throttle plates. The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the air valves are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel <b>metering</b> <b>holes</b> as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened.

40|$|On Leg 54 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, four holes were drilled at Site 424, about 20 km {{south of}} the Galapagos Spreading Center (GSC). The holes were {{situated}} less than 300 meters from each other on a north-south line in water about 2700 meters deep, near 0 ° 35 'N and 86 ° 07 'W. The age of the basaltic basement here is about 0. 60 to 0. 62 m. y. (Hekinian et al., 1978). This particular site was chosen because a major sea-floor hydrothermal system, with associated sediments, occurs in this area (Klitgord and Mudie, 1974; Lonsdale, 1977). The sampling area is characterized by small mounds, 5 to 20 meters high, parallel to the axis of the GSC, and is associated with heat flow (Williams et al., 1974; Crane and Normark, 1977). The mounds are arrayed above faults in the basaltic basement (Lonsdale, 1977). The regional sedimentary blanket is about 30 meters thick. Bottom photographs made of the mounds by Corliss et al. (1978) show that they consist of black crusts with light brown and orange patches and that some are partially covered by organisms (e. g., bivalves).

40|$|The {{anisotropy}} {{of magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS), bulk suscep-tibility, and directions {{and stability of}} remanent magnetism of 37 basalt specimens from Hole 332 B and Sites 334 and 335 have been measured. The remanent magnetism shows that at Site 335, a single stable reversed polarity is recorded between 467 and 517 meters depth. At Site 334, a reversed polarity body occurs between normal polarity units at 320 meters depth. Similarly, a normal polarity body probably occurs between reversed units at 466 <b>meters</b> in <b>Hole</b> 332 B which otherwise appears to be reversely magnetized throughout the 156 to 590 meters depth. Below 590 <b>meters</b> in <b>Hole</b> 332 B, there exist three samples with stable anomalously low inclinations of remanent magnetism, interspersed by a normally magnetized unit at 610 meters depth. We suspect that pillow segments which have rolled after reaching the blocking temperature may be represented by these three units with the opposite polarity body representing an intru-sion. The AMS data may (as far as we know), with one definite excep-tion, represent only single specimens from separate bodies, and are thus not reliably analyzed {{in terms of our}} proposed emplacement mode diagnosis techniques. According, however, to an AMS parameter (F) designed to emphasize maximum axis elongation, and to conclusions derived from a previous empirical application of Fto many bodies of known emplacement mode, cores from the three holes are dominantly extrusive in origin. Only five specimens are diagnosed as intrusive. None of these possess anomalous inclination of remanent magnetism which we believe can most readily occur in extrusives. Two of these five specimens appear to possess the appropriate "intrusive " AMS signature because of an unusually well defined zone of crystal set-tling and growth towards the base of what is otherwise probably an extrusive body between 199 and 204 <b>meters</b> depth in <b>Hole</b> 332 B.

Designed to compare two groups of composting piles, one pile consisted of 500 kilograms of waste originating from local authorities while the other amounted to 250 kilograms of waste collected from households. With six piles of each type, aeration was done by manual turning and emissions were sampled in closed flux chambers and analyzed by gas chromatographs. A control experiment, modeling landfill sites, {{was set up in}} a one x one x one <b>meter</b> <b>hole.</b> Results from the experiment showed that emission ratios from the 500 kg was 1. 3613 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste, and 1. 3427 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste from the 250 kg experiment. The 500 kg experiment decreased emissions by 0. 059185 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste and the 250 kg experiment, emissions decreased by 0. 059206 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste when compared to the control group. In summary, pile size has no effect on emission ratios. Statistical testing found no significance difference between emissions from the 500 kg compared with the 250 kg.
