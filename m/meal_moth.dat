5000|$|The Painted <b>Meal</b> <b>Moth</b> or Poplar Pyralis (Pyralis pictalis) is a snout moth (family (Pyralidae). It {{is closely}} related to the family's type species the <b>Meal</b> <b>Moth</b> (P. farinalis) and {{consequently}} belongs to the tribe Pyralini of the snout moth subfamily Pyralinae. Its native range is tropical Asia to East Asia and to the Wallacea and adjacent regions, but it has been quite widely (though involuntarily) distributed by humans. The term [...] "Poplar" [...] in its common name does not refer to the trees, but to Poplar, London, where type specimen [...] - [...] from such an introduction [...] - [...] was caught. It was called Scarce <b>Meal</b> <b>Moth</b> in the original description, which is only correct for the fringes of its range however.|$|E

50|$|Anna Levinson has {{collaborated with}} {{national}} and international research teams like those of Wittko Francke, Christoph Reichmuth, Kenji Mori, Robert M. Silverstein and Konstantin Buchelos investigating the mode of action and employment of pheromone traps for stored product beetles and moths, particularly khapra beetles, hide beetles, tobacco beetles, grain <b>moths,</b> <b>meal</b> <b>moths,</b> flour moths, tobacco moths as well as almond moths. These traps were eventually patented in numerous countries and are routinely used until now. They significantly {{reduce the number of}} insecticidal treatments required in the storage environment. In total she wrote more than 100 scientific papers.|$|R
50|$|Pyralis farinalis, a {{somewhat}} more distantly related and more robust snout moth, is known as <b>meal</b> <b>moth.</b> Its caterpillars have similar habits.|$|E
50|$|Pyralis farinalis, the <b>meal</b> <b>moth,</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} moth {{of the family}} Pyralidae. Its larvae (caterpillars) are pests of certain stored foods, namely milled plant products.|$|E
50|$|Pyralis lienigialis, the {{northern}} <b>meal</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species of}} snout moth. It is found in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Great Britain, Fennoscandia, Estonia, Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldavia and Romania.|$|E
30|$|Larvae feed on eggs, {{either their}} own or those of <b>meal</b> <b>moths,</b> by sinking their {{mouthparts}} deeply into the eggs and biting {{their way through the}} egg shells (Figure 3 b, c). In close and intimate contact with the eggshells, they crack them open. As a consequence, the egg content leaks out of the eggs and the larvae lick and suck up whatever they can get out of it (Figure 3 c). During this process, there seems to be ample opportunity for the egg contents to get 'contaminated' with any compound coating the eggs and the surface on which the eggs are placed which in our case and that of Schmidt et al. [1] were Bt-sprayed 2 × 2 -cm pieces of cardboard. These observations strongly suggest that the main difference between the methods employed by Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] and Schmidt et al. [1] is that in the former trials, the larvae ingested a water/sugar-solution mixed with Bt toxins and in the latter, the liquid egg content mixed with Bt toxins.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations indicate {{insects are}} capable of becoming resistant {{to a variety of}} insecticidal agents, the most well-known being corn rootworm pyrethroid resistance in east central Nebraska. Larvae of the Diamondback and Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moths</b> show resistance to moderate levels of Bacillus thuriengensis (Bt) toxins, similar to the proteins expressed by transgenic corn plants (e. g., Yieldgard‚). The European corn borer (ECB) is a major corn pest in Iowa and the Midwestern United States. Any spread of potential resistance in field populations will depend on movement of moths between different locations. In the Midwest, two ECB ecotypes are present that differ in the number of generations (flights) per year: bivoltine (2 flights) and the more northern univoltine (one flight). Our lab developed genetic markers that detect European corn borer DNA differences between individual moths. Our objective was to estimate DNA difference between collection sites and observe level of relatedness and moth movement in the Midwest. Field movement of moths may impact the potential spread of Bt resistance...|$|R
40|$|Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moths,</b> Plodia interpunctella Hubner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), have ears {{which are}} {{sensitive}} to high-frequency calls produced by echolocating, insectivorous bats. The influence of artificially generated, high-intensity, ultrasound signals (25 kHz, 106 dB SPL at 1 m distance) on different parameters involved in the odour-mediated mating behaviour of this species and its potential use in population control was investigated. All moths flying towards olfactory cues in flight tunnel experiments reacted strongly to a 1 s ultrasound pulse by cessation of flight and {{falling out of the}} odour plume. The source contact proportion of both male moths orienting towards the female-produced sex pheromone and of mated female moths orienting towards an oviposition cue was reduced by 40 %, compared to unexposed moths. Calling females responded to the sound by retraction of the ovipositor or by falling to the ground. Long-term exposure to repetitive pulses of ultrasound suppressed female calling by up to 27 %. Furthermore, mating in plastic tents was disrupted by up to 58 % in ultrasound-treated tents using different sound regimens, compared to control tents. The results are discussed in relation to the potential use of ultrasound technology for the population control of pyralid stored product pests...|$|R
50|$|They {{are deemed}} to {{represent}} the lineage around the type species, the <b>Meal</b> <b>Moth</b> (Pyralis farinalis), a somewhat notorious pest of stored cereals and similar goods. Like this species, Pyralini are usually largish snout moths; some are boldly colored (often in bright brown to yellow hues) by standards of their family.|$|E
5000|$|The similar {{scavenger}} species Aglossa cuprina, formerly misidentified as Aglossa pinguinalis, is {{most commonly}} known as the [...] "grease moth". It belongs to the lepidopteran family, Pyralidae, (the snout moths). The grease moth is closely related to the genus Pyralis, and as a result, is usually associated with the <b>meal</b> <b>moth,</b> Pyralis farinalis.|$|E
50|$|Home stored product {{entomology}} is {{the study}} of insects which infest foodstuffs stored in the home. It deals with the prevention, detection and eradication of the pests. The five major categories of insects considered in this article are flour beetles, the drugstore beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> and fruit flies.|$|E
5000|$|Indianmeal moths can infest {{a variety}} of foods found in the home. Coarsely ground grains, cereals, dried fruits, and herbs are common items the moths {{have been known to}} infest. They have also been found in animal feeds, such as dry dog food, fish food and even bird seed. Adult moths are small; generally, their length averages about 3/8 inch, with a 5/8 inch wing span. As adults, the moths are easily {{identified}} by an overall grayish, dirty complexion. However, the wing tips have a bronze color that helps differentiate this particular moth from other household moths. The adults have a distinct forewing pattern, as well, which consists of a light-colored base with about two-thirds of the distal area a red to copper color. [...] The larval stage, or caterpillar, is characterized by a pinkish or yellowish-green body color with a dark brown head. The larval stage of the moth’s life cycle is centered on food sources; during the last instar, these larvae are characterized by a movement towards a protected area to pupate. These caterpillars have the capacity to chew through plastic packaging and will often produce silk that loosely binds to food fragments. The pupal stage is generally observed as tiny cocoons that hang from the ceiling; these cocoons can also be found on walls, as well as near the food source. A female can lay over 200 eggs, and will usually die after this process because adults Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moths</b> do not eat.|$|R

50|$|The <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> (Pyralis farinalis) and {{the grease}} moth (Aglossa pinguinalis) are pests of stored food products, {{in the case}} of the grease moth {{including}} fats (which are also eaten by the adult moths), and have been inadvertently spread almost world-wide by transport of such goods. Most other species' caterpillars are leaf feeders; the extremely polyphagous larvae of Pyralis manihotalis have been reared from bat guano.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} where this moth originated, {{but it seems to}} have been the general region of Southeast Asia. Presumably, the Painted <b>Meal</b> <b>Moth</b> natively ranged from southern India and Sri Lanka northeastwards to Japan and southeastwards at least to Sumatra, Java and at least parts of Borneo; perhaps its natural range extended as far as the Philippines in the east, and to New Guinea or even Fiji in the southeast.|$|E
50|$|Indian meal moths infest both {{cereal and}} stored grain products, {{packaged}} goods, and surface layers of shelled corn. The most telltale {{sign of the}} Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> is the silk webbing the larvae (caterpillars) produce when feeding on the surfaces of foods. This silk webbing {{may appear to be}} or resemble cobwebs inside the products' containers. Often, a few larvae may be found in the packaging of the product, along with the ‘cobwebs’, cast skins and frass.|$|E
50|$|Larvae {{are white}} worms with black heads, which, {{when ready to}} pupate, crawl up {{the walls of the}} home in most cases, and are {{suspended}} from the ceiling attached by a single silken thread. Most complaints about these moths come during the warmer parts of the year- usually July through August- but the moths can appear during any month. As with all insects important to stored product entomology, it cannot be automatically assumed that products were previously infested, yet, it is more common for these moths to contaminate products before purchase than for the moth to fly into a home through open windows or doors. An important aspect of the Indian <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> is that the larva is the only stage of the insect's life cycle to feed on stored products, the adults do not.|$|E

3000|$|... 1. Diet: In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the perceived shortcoming when offering Bt toxin-coated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs and to allow for easier uptake of the toxin, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] offered each larva droplets of sugar/water solution with and without Bt toxins. However, since carnivorous larvae of ladybird beetles cannot sustain themselves on sugar solution only, this kind of liquid food could only be offered for 24 h, after which the larvae were given more substantial food containing proteins. Hence, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] transferred their A. bipunctata larvae to clean petri dishes and fed them 'ad libitum with <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs.' This procedure was apparently carried out four times in total, always {{at the beginning of}} a new larval instar (see below). Notably, the <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs were not coated with Bt toxins.|$|E
30|$|Two {{observations}} motivated us {{to repeat}} the direct feeding trials with A. bipunctata using a combined protocol. For one, Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] did not use Bt toxin-coated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs but used untreated <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs in their bitrophic experiments with A. bipunctata. Coating <b>meal</b> <b>moth</b> eggs is a simple and straightforward method widely used in ecotoxicity testing of side effects of pesticides, for example, with another predator species Chrysoperla carnea (the green lacewing) (see also commentary in this volume). Secondly, we noted in the Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] study that mortality rates in the Cry 1 Ab toxin treatment were also 9 % higher {{than those in the}} control (15.0 % vs. 24.3 %) and close to those observed by Schmidt et al. [1] in their lowest Bt concentration treatment (27.5 %) (Figure 1 and Table 1).|$|E
