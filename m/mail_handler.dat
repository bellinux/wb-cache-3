40|$|Wednesday, October 24, 2001, 22 : 30 EDT (10 : 30 PM EDT) CDCHAN- 00045 - 2001 - 10 - 24 -ADV-N As of October 24, 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{is aware}} of five cases of inhalational anthrax among postal workers and <b>mail</b> <b>handlers,</b> {{including}} two fatal cases, as well as additional cases of cutaneous anthrax. These cases {{have been associated with}} exposure to mail contaminated with Bacillus anthracis. This document provides interim recommendations for protecting workers involved in mail sorting, distribution, and handling. A program to reduce skin or respiratory exposures to B. anthracis spores may decrease the risk of anthrax disease in <b>mail</b> <b>handlers.</b> These interim recommendations are based on the limited information available on ways to avoid infection and the effectiveness of various prevention strategies. These recommendations will be updated as new information becomes available. A hierarchy of measures should be used to control potential exposures to B. anthracis. These include, in hierarchical order, engineering controls to capture B. anthracis spores at potential points of release, housekeeping measures to reduce the spread of B. anthracis spores, and personal protective equipment to prevent worker exposure. The selection of these measures may be made after conducting a site-specific evaluation of the potential risk for B. anthracis exposure in each mail-handling facility. These recommendations should be incorporated into a comprehensive safety and health program for protecting <b>mail</b> <b>handlers.</b> A major source of dust in mail handling facilities occurs during the operation and maintenance of high-speed mail handling machines. The blowdown of these machines in the maintenance operation can aerosolize particles in the size range of B. anthracis spores. Pinch roller operations should be evaluated for their potential to force dustcontaining spores from envelopes. The following recommendations are provided for workers potentially exposed to B. anthracis spores while handling or processing mail. These recommendations do not address instances where a known exposure has occurred. Mail facilities should develop an emergency plan to contain the hazards; this plan should be put into effect when a known or suspected exposure to B. anthracis occurs.

5000|$|In 1962, the Laborers {{met with}} President John F. Kennedy at the White House to {{pledge not to}} {{discriminate}} when hiring. Later, after President Kennedy was assassinated, the union {{went back to the}} White House yet again, this time to pledge support for President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty." [...] Union members even participated in Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington in 1963. In 1965, the union was renamed the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). A year later, LIUNA created the Laborers’ Political League in order to both influence politics and encourage its members to participate in the political process. In 1968, the union expanded to include over 60,000 new workers from the National Association of Post Office <b>Mail</b> <b>Handlers,</b> Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders.

50|$|On Thursday, July 30, 2009, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 12-1 {{in favor}} of S. 1507 (Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Funding Reform Act of 2009), which would provide {{financial}} relief to the Postal Service. An amendment, offered by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), requiring the arbitrator {{to take into consideration}} the financial health of the Postal Service when deciding Postal Union contracts, was added prior to its passage. Sen.

40|$|In October 2001, {{the first}} inhalational anthrax {{case in the}} United States since 1976 was {{identified}} in a media company worker in Florida. A national investigation was initiated to identify additional cases and determine possible exposures to Bacillus anthracis. Surveillance was enhanced through health-care facilities, laboratories, and other means to identify cases, which were defined as clinically compatible illness with laboratory-confirmed B. anthracis infection. From October 4 to November 20, 2001, 22 cases of anthrax (11 inhalational, 11 cutaneous) were identified; 5 of the inhalational cases were fatal. Twenty (91 %) case-patients were either <b>mail</b> <b>handlers</b> or were exposed to worksites where contaminated mail was processed or received. B. anthracis isolates from four powder-containing envelopes, 17 specimens from patients, and 106 environmental samples were indistinguishable by molecular subtyping. Illness and death occurred not only at targeted worksites, but also along the path of mail and in other settings. Continued vigilance for cases is needed among health-care providers {{and members of the}} public health and law enforcement communities. 12396909 PMC 273029...|$|R
40|$|Wellness Education and Job-Related Injuries and Illnesses for Federal Employees by Eunice Scott MS, Walden University, 2013 BS, Excelsior College, 2011 Doctoral Study Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Nursing Practice Walden University March 2017 â?? Work-related {{injuries}} and illnesses {{may lead to}} absenteeism, which affects the level of productivity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the success of an employee workplace training program on work-related injury and illness rates at selected federal districts within a federal organization. Newman 2 ̆ 7 s model, which describes internal and external factors that may have an effect on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s health, was the framework that guided this project. A pre-post design was used to compare data from 2 publically available data sets, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Illness and Injury and the Voice of the Employee Survey, for the years 2013 and 2014, before and after a wellness training program. According to a descriptive analysis of 91 illness and injury events that occurred during the 2 -year period, the greatest number of employees who reported illnesses were <b>mail</b> <b>handlers</b> and <b>mail</b> processing clerks. Slips/trips and falls, strikes by machine/equipment or other objects, and repetitive motion were the top 3 types of injuries. After training, the total number of illness and injury days away from work and days of limited duty were decreased, indicating a positive impact of this workplace wellness program and a need for future training for these workers. This project has the potential to affect social change by supporting the benefits of workplace wellness in improving employee health and reducing workplace injuries at federal agencies...|$|R
40|$|In early 2000 Southern California Edison (SCE), in {{partnership}} with the Toyota Technical Center, initiated a test of five RAV 4 Electric Vehicles (EVs) to evaluate the durability and reliability of their traction battery, and drive train, over a driving distance of 100, 000 miles and beyond. The five vehicles in the project include three 1998 conductively charged RAV 4 EVs and two 1999 inductively charged RAV 4 EVs. The 320 RAV 4 EVs of the SCE fleet are used primarily by meter readers, service managers, field representatives, service planners and <b>mail</b> <b>handlers,</b> and for security patrols and carpools. As of June, 2003, and in 5 years of operation, the RAV 4 EV fleet had logged more than 6. 9 million miles, preventing the emission of about 830 tons of air pollutants, and of more than 3, 700 tons of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions. SCE and Toyota began the test project in February 2000 to obtain data on operating costs, vehicle efficiency, maintenance requirements, battery life, charging issues and other factors that are specific to the long term use of EVs. Employees with long commutes were selected to drive the vehicles daily to and from work, at SCE's headquarters in Rosemead, or at the ISO 9001 : 2000 - certified Electric Vehicle Technical Center (EVTC) in Pomona. On November 7, 2002, the first of the five RAV 4 EVs under test to reach 100, 000 miles had traveled the equivalent distance of Los Angeles to New York City 34 times without emitting a single tailpipe pollutant, or using a single quart of oil. In early June 2003 two other vehicles had reached the 100, 000 mile goal. Data collected with the test vehicles, and the RAV 4 EV fleet, are confirming that EVs with Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, and a mature drive train design, are compatible with a variety of mission requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} {{has changed the}} face of communication and enables more people to reach more other people than ever before. In this work, we employ the robustness of the internet by developing a smart agent alert system that delivers spy information instantly. The short message service (SMS) and Email capabilities were maximized to achieve this, seven model blocks were used: SMS model, Email model, the administrator console, the <b>mail</b> checker, web <b>handler,</b> the web interface and database model. SMS model is responsible for routing the SMS, it connect with the short message service centre (SMSC). When the system sends a text message to a user, the phone actually sends the message to the SMSC, which stores the message and then delivers it when the recipient is on the network. Email model is responsible for sending the message to the user; it connects to the mail checker to report back to the system where the mail is delivered to the user. The administrator console is an administration tool that enables Email and SMS Alert (EMSA) System administrators to administer the EMSA system components.
