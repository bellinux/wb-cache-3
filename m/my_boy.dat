I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

The first parade of the new regiment the following day was inspected by Sir John Crocker, commander of I Corps and the most senior RTR officer in the theatre.

Since late 2005, she has appeared {{in a number of}} British television commercials for Tetley Tea.

On ITV, she starred alongside David Haig, Daniel Radcliffe and Carey Mulligan in <b>My</b> <b>Boy</b> Jack, the story of author Rudyard Kipling's search for his son lost in the First World War.|$|E
500|$|Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith {{writes that}} the music for the shower scene is [...] "probably the most famous (and most imitated) cue in film music," [...] but Hitchcock was {{originally}} opposed to having music in this scene. When Herrmann played the shower scene cue for Hitchcock, the director approved its use in the film. Herrmann reminded Hitchcock of his instructions not to score this scene, to which Hitchcock replied, [...] "Improper suggestion, <b>my</b> <b>boy,</b> improper suggestion." [...] This {{was one of two}} important disagreements Hitchcock had with Herrmann, in which Herrmann ignored Hitchcock's instructions. The second one, over the score for Torn Curtain (1966), resulted in the end of their professional collaboration. A survey conducted by PRS for Music, in 2009, showed that the British public consider the score from 'the shower scene' to be the scariest theme from any film.|$|E
500|$|On 18 November 1763 the Mozart family {{arrived in}} Paris, {{one of the}} most {{important}} musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity. Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: [...] "the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: [...] "My little girl, although only 12 years old, is {{one of the most}} skilful players in Europe and, in a word, <b>my</b> <b>boy</b> knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty".|$|E

500|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is more satirical in tone {{than the}} {{previous}} three Blackadder series and most sitcoms, taking the opportunity to present an anti-war message. The dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings {{about the nature of}} the war, its origins and the effects on the soldiers who suffered over its course. The idea that the soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from the action was also referenced on many occasions, such as when Melchett says to Baldrick, [...] "Don't you worry <b>my</b> <b>boy,</b> if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you!", to which Blackadder responds, [...] "About 35 miles behind you!". In the episode [...] "Corporal Punishment", Blackadder justifies the shooting for food of a carrier pigeon (which turns out to be Melchett's pet) by saying, [...] "With 50,000 men getting killed a week, who's going to miss a pigeon?" [...] This episode sees Blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for the act, a reference to the capital sentences carried out under the laws of war in force at the time.|$|E
500|$|Radcliffe {{made his}} film debut in The Tailor of Panama, an American 2001 film based on John le Carré's 1996 spy novel, and a {{moderate}} commercial success. In 2002, {{he made his}} stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I Wrote, directed by Kenneth Branaghwho also appeared {{with him in the}} second Harry Potter film. In 2007, he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in <b>My</b> <b>Boy</b> Jack, a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, [...] "For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{victories}} at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, {{he returned}} to Celtic Park, {{the home of the}} Irish American Athletic Club, in Queens, New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union's All-Around Championship. Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, [...] "Jim, <b>my</b> <b>boy,</b> you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." [...] He told a reporter from New York World, [...] "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways.

In August, Ice {{performed}} at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was officially announced that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. His sixth studio album, WTF, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice's return to Electronica, with songs like [...] "Turn It Up", [...] "Rock Star Party", [...] "Nightmare Disco" [...] and [...] "Cadillac Ninjas". On the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice was quoted saying [...] "It's like techno hip-hop. European.

500|$|On July 12, 2011, it was {{reported}} that she had reunited with [...] L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace Records at the start of her career and was a factor in the commercial success of her debut album, Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine went on to confirm her move to Epic in September 2011. On May 30, 2012 during promotional appearances for That's <b>My</b> <b>Boy,</b> a film Ciara stars in, the singer announced she had a new single on the way called [...] "Sweat". Just five days later on June 4, 2012, [...] "Sweat" [...] premiered online, the bass-heavy record features upcoming rapper 2 Chainz and was unveiled as the lead single from Ciara's fifth album Ciara (2013). The record was serviced to rhythmic radio stations on June 18, 2012 and was scheduled for release as a digital download on June 19, 2012. However, the digital release did not happen as planned, and when charting Billboard listed the song as a promotional single. On August 13, 2012, Ciara revealed through a handwritten letter that a song called [...] "Sorry" [...] would be released as the album's lead single.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me... <b>my</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E
