50|$|There {{are around}} 1,300 species of {{freshwater}} crabs, {{distributed throughout the}} tropics and subtropics, divided among eight families. They show direct development and maternal care of {{a small number of}} offspring, in contrast to <b>marine</b> <b>crabs</b> which release thousands of planktonic larvae. This limits the dispersal abilities of freshwater crabs, so they tend to be endemic to small areas. As a result, a large proportion are threatened with extinction.|$|E

50|$|The {{external}} morphology {{of freshwater}} crabs varies very little, {{and so the}} form of the gonopod (first abdominal appendage, modified for insemination) is of critical importance for classification. Development of freshwater crabs is characteristically direct, where the eggs hatch as juveniles, with the larval stages passing within the egg. The broods comprise only a few hundred eggs (compared to hundreds of thousands for <b>marine</b> <b>crabs)</b> each of which is quite large, at a diameter of around 1 mm.|$|E
50|$|A fiddler crab, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a calling crab, may be any of approximately 100 species of semi-terrestrial <b>marine</b> <b>crabs</b> which make up the genus Uca. As {{members of the family}} Ocypodidae, fiddler crabs are most closely related to the ghost crabs of the genus Ocypode. This entire group is composed of small crabs - the largest being slightly over two inches across. Fiddler crabs are found along sea beaches and brackish inter-tidal mud flats, lagoons and swamps. Fiddler crabs are most well known for their sexually dimorphic claws; the males’ major claw is much larger than the minor claw while the females’ claws are both the same size.|$|E

50|$|The family Homolidae, {{known as}} carrier crabs or porter crabs, {{contains}} 14 genera of <b>marine</b> <b>crabs.</b> They mostly {{live on the}} continental slope and continental shelf, and are rarely encountered. Members of the Homolidae have their fifth pereiopods (last pair of walking legs) in a sub-dorsal position, which allows them to hold objects in place over the rear half of the carapace. The objects carried include sponges, black corals and gorgonians, and this behaviour may be a defence mechanism against predators. Some species have been observed carrying living sea urchins in a symbiotic relationship which allows them {{to benefit from the}} protection of the urchin's dangerous spikes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} fresh and marine-water crabs, shrimps and {{lobsters}} {{have also been}} recorded in Bangladesh. 4 species of freshwater and 11 species of <b>marine</b> <b>crabs</b> have been discovered. The most commercially exploited species of the coastal area is Scylla serrata (mud crab). There {{are at least two}} species of king crabs found in the coastal zone. About 10 species of freshwater shrimp/prawns and 19 species of marine shrimps are recorded. Six species of lobsters are found to occur in the Bay of Bengal, Panulirus polyphagus and Thenus orientalis are the two most commercially important species. Daphnia is a common freshwater genus among the 20 copepod species. Two species of starfish have also been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Most osmoconformers are marine {{invertebrates}} such as echinoderms (such as starfish), mussels, <b>marine</b> <b>crabs,</b> lobsters, jellyfish, ascidians (sea squirts - primitive chordates), and scallops. Some insects are also osmoconformers. [...] Some osmoconformers, such as echinoderms, are stenohaline, {{which means they}} can only survive in a limited range of external osmolarities. The survival of such organisms is thus contingent on their external osmotic environment remaining relatively constant. [...] On the other hand, some osmoconformers are classified as euryhaline, which means they can survive in {{a broad range of}} external osmolarities. Mussels are a prime example of a euryhaline osmoconformer. Mussels have adapted to survive in a broad range of external salinities due to their ability to close their shells which allows them to seclude themselves from unfavorable external environments.|$|E

30|$|The {{trophic ecology}} of brachyuran crabs {{has been widely}} studied in <b>marine</b> <b>crabs</b> {{probably}} because of their ecological and economic importance (Wear and Haddon [1987]; Freire [1996]; Cannicci et al. [1996]; Mantelatto and Petracco [1997]; Balasubramanian and Suseelan [1998]; Frick et al. [2001]; Mantelatto and Christofeletti [2001]; Josileen [2011]). However, among freshwater crabs, the research effort {{in this area is}} more recent with little emphasis in trichodactylid crabs (Collins et al. [2007]; Carvalho et al. [2013 a]; Williner and Collins [2013]; Pirela and Rincón [2013]). Knowledge about trophic ecology aspects of any species is essential to understand the nutritional requirements and how species interact with the environment and with other organisms. In inland water systems, it is important to characterize the trophic links in order to identify the ‘trophic species’ and, from the studies of functional diversity, understand the dynamics of matter and energy in these environments (Woodward [2009]).|$|E
