50|$|Current {{treatment}} options for Boxer cardiomyopathy are largely {{restricted to the}} use of oral anti-arrhythmic medications. The aim of therapy is to minimize ventricular ectopy, eliminate syncopal episodes, and prevent sudden cardiac death. A number of medications have been used for this purpose, including atenolol, procainamide, sotalol, <b>mexiletine,</b> and amiodarone. Combinations can also be used. Sotalol is probably the most commonly used antiarrhythmic at this time.

40|$|<b>Mexiletine</b> and {{lidocaine}} {{are widely}} used class IB anti-arrhythmic drugs that are considered to act by blocking voltage-gated open sodium currents for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias and relief of pain. To gain mechanistic insights into action of anti-arrhythmics, we characterized biophysical properties of Na(v) 1. 5 and Na(v) 1. 7 channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and compared their use-dependent block in response to <b>mexiletine</b> and lidocaine using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. While the voltage-dependent activation of Na(v) 1. 5 or Na(v) 1. 7 was not affected by <b>mexiletine</b> and lidocaine, the steady-state fast and slow inactivation of Na(v) 1. 5 and Na(v) 1. 7 were significantly shifted to hyperpolarized direction by either <b>mexiletine</b> or lidocaine in dose-dependent manner. Both <b>mexiletine</b> and lidocaine enhanced the slow component of closed-state inactivation, with <b>mexiletine</b> exerting stronger inhibition on either Na(v) 1. 5 or Na(v) 1. 7. The recovery from inactivation of Na(v) 1. 5 or Na(v) 1. 7 was significantly prolonged by <b>mexiletine</b> compared to lidocaine. Furthermore, <b>mexiletine</b> displayed a pronounced and prominent use-dependent inhibition of Na(v) 1. 5 than lidocaine, but not Na(v) 1. 7 channels.

40|$|Introduction: The {{therapeutic}} trough {{range for}} <b>mexiletine</b> (0. 8 – 2 [*]mcg/mL) was largely {{established in the}} setting of arrhythmia prophylaxis following myocardial infarction. Objective: Describe the usage patterns of serum <b>mexiletine</b> concentrations and the impact of these concentrations on <b>mexiletine</b> dosing in modern practice for ventricular arrhythmia treatment. Methods: A single-center, retrospective analysis was conducted using the electronic medical record to identify serum <b>mexiletine</b> concentrations drawn between December 2004 and December 2014. The primary endpoint was the incidence of <b>mexiletine</b> concentrations drawn as troughs. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of <b>mexiletine</b> concentrations that prompted a dose change, association between adverse events and elevated concentrations, and association between baseline characteristics and <b>mexiletine</b> concentrations. Results: A total of 237 individual concentrations were included for analysis with 109 (46. 0 %) drawn appropriately as trough concentrations. Only 31 (13. 1 %) of the 237 concentrations drawn prompted a dose change. <b>Mexiletine</b> was primarily used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (96. 2 %), and 108 (45. 6 %) concentrations were drawn in an effort to assess efficacy. The median concentration was statistically different between patients with and without an adverse event (0. 8 vs 0. 7 [*]mcg/mL, respectively; p[*]=[*] 0. 017), but may not represent a clinical significance. Patients with hepatic dysfunction had higher median concentrations compared to those without hepatic dysfunction (1. 30 vs 1. 07 [*]mcg/mL; p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusion: <b>Mexiletine</b> concentrations are often drawn at inappropriate times and seldom influence a dose change.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} and tolerance of disopyramide and <b>mexiletine</b> used alone and in combination were studied in 21 patients with frequent (≥ 30 /h) ventricular premature complexes. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and during therapy with disopyramide alone, <b>mexiletine</b> alone and {{a combination of}} disopyramide and <b>mexiletine.</b> During single drug therapy, the dose of disopyramide was 602 +- 152 mg/day and that of <b>mexiletine</b> was 738 ± 144 mg/day. During combination therapy with smaller doses of disopyramide (524 ± 134 mg/day) and <b>mexiletine</b> (652 ± 146 mg/day), no patient had side effects. At baseline before therapy, {{the mean number of}} ventricular premature complexes per hour, was 608 ± 757, of couplets per hour was 22. 4 ± 45. 8 and of episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia/ 24 h was 219. 7 ± 758. 2. The mean number of ventricular premature complexes per hour was reduced to 156 ± 217 with disopyramide alone, 188 ± 298 with <b>mexiletine</b> alone and 76 ± 144 with combination therapy (p; 83 % reduction in ventricular premature complexes and abolition of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was found in 5 (24 %) of 21 patients during therapy with disopyramide alone, in 3 (14 %) receiving <b>mexiletine</b> alone and in 13 (62 %) receiving combination therapy (p < 0. 05 for combination therapy versus disopyramide or mexiletine; p = NS for disopyramide versus <b>mexiletine).</b> Thus, the antiarrhythmic effects of disopyramide and <b>mexiletine</b> are additive. A combination of disopyramide and <b>mexiletine</b> in smaller and well tolerated doses may avoid dose-related side effects and is more effective than either drug used alone at higher doses. Therefore, when disopyramide or <b>mexiletine</b> is ineffective because dose-related side effects limit the maximal tolerated dose, combination therapy in smaller and more tolerable doses may avoid side effects and may be more effective than treatment with either drug alone at the maximal tolerated dose...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The non-selective {{sodium channel}} {{inhibitor}} <b>mexiletine</b> {{has been found}} to be effective in several animal models of chronic pain and has become popular in the clinical setting as an orally available alternative to lidocaine. It remains unclear why patients with monogenic pain disorders secondary to gain-of-function SCN 9 a mutations benefit from a low systemic concentration of <b>mexiletine,</b> which does not usually induce adverse neurological side effects. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the biophysical effects of <b>mexiletine</b> on the L 858 F primary erythromelalgia NaV 1. 7 mutation in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human wild-type and L 858 F-mutated NaV 1. 7 channels were expressed in HEK 293 A cells. Whole-cell currents were recorded by voltage-clamp techniques to characterize the effect of <b>mexiletine</b> on channel gating properties. KEY RESULTS: While the concentration-dependent tonic block of peak currents by <b>mexiletine</b> was similar in wild-type and L 858 F channels, phasic block was more pronounced in cells transfected with the L 858 F mutation. Moreover, <b>mexiletine</b> substantially shifted the pathologically-hyperpolarized voltage-dependence of steady-state activation in L 858 F-mutated channels towards wild-type values and the voltage-dependence of steady-state fast inactivation was shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials, leading to an overall reduction in window currents. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: <b>Mexiletine</b> has a normalizing effect on the pathological gating properties of the L 858 F gain-of-function mutation in NaV 1. 7, which, in part, might explain the beneficial effects of systemic treatment with <b>mexiletine</b> in patients with gain-of-function sodium channel disorders...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mexiletine</b> {{belongs to}} class IB {{antiarrhythmic}} drugs {{and it is}} still considered a drug of choice for treating myotonias.

40|$|ABSTRACT Combination {{therapy with}} <b>mexiletine</b> and {{quinidine}} {{has been shown}} to be more effective than either monotherapy in treating patients with ventricular tachycardia. This enhanced efficacy was associated with prolongation of ventricular refractoriness and conduction time in the infarct zone. As sodium channel activity is a determinant of both conduction time and refractoriness we formed the hypothesis that the mexiletine-quinidine interaction was due at least in part to interactions involving the sodium channel. To assess the role of sodium channel blockade in the enhanced anti-arrhythmic activity of mexiletine-quinidine combination we determined whether the electrophysiological and anti-arrhythmic effects of tetrodotoxin combined with <b>mexiletine</b> or quinidine mimicked the effect seen with <b>mexiletine</b> combined with quinidine. Eighty isolated perfused rabbit hearts were treated with <b>mexiletine,</b> quinidine and tetrodotoxin either alone or in combination before and after circumflex occlusion-reperfusion. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in response to single extrastimuli in all 24 hearts treated with a saline control infusion. Combinations of <b>mexiletine</b> and quinidine at concentrations which alone had little electrophysiological activity produced anti-arrhythmic activity greater than that seen with high concentrations of <b>mexiletine</b> or quinidine alone.
