However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E

25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E

In 1913, he led a committee looking at housing conditions in Birmingham. It was a forerunner to the parliamentary Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919–21), {{of which he was}} chairman. Chamberlain found that over 100,000housing units lacked toilet facilities, with nearly half of those not even having running water. He advocated gradual reorganisation to abate the problem, and warned that the city government <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to take over property if the private sector failed. Under Chamberlain's direction, Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain which would, in time, be mirrored by other large industrial cities such as Liverpool and Leeds.

Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty. The people over there are very backward and very primitive, and they just make a mess out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E

500|$|In the Soviet Union, {{speaking}} to his generals in December 1940, Stalin mentioned Hitler's references to {{an attack on}} the Soviet Union in Mein Kampf and Hitler's belief that the Red Army would need four years to ready itself. Stalin declared [...] "we <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> much earlier" [...] and [...] "we will try to delay the war for another two years". As early as August 1940, British intelligence had received hints of German plans to attack the Soviets only a week after Hitler informally approved the plans for Barbarossa and warned the Soviet Union accordingly. But Stalin's distrust of the British led him to ignore their warnings in the belief that they were a trick designed to bring the Soviet Union into the war on their side. [...] In early-1941, Stalin's own intelligence services and American intelligence gave regular and repeated warnings of an impending German attack. Soviet spy Richard Sorge also gave Stalin the exact German launch date, but Sorge and other informers had previously given different invasion dates that passed peacefully before the actual invasion. Stalin acknowledged the possibility of an attack in general and therefore made significant preparations, but decided not to run the risk of provoking Hitler.|$|E
