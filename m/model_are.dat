5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone <b>Model</b> <b>are</b> the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|Computationally {{efficient}} <b>models</b> <b>are</b> {{required for}} <b>modelling</b> transient finite server queueing systems.

40|$|Abstract. GM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> {{a widely}} used model for forecasting. The {{characteristics}} of the <b>model</b> have <b>been</b> analyzed. The fact that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> a biased exponential <b>model</b> has <b>been</b> testified. Based on the results, UGM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper. The proposed model has more extensive application scope than GM (1, 1) model {{for the reason that}} the model can limit the inherent deviation of GM (1, 1) model. The proposed <b>model</b> <b>is</b> applied to the field of electric load forecasting, the actual results also show that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> better than GM (1, 1) model. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{model of}} set theory is called {{standard}} if the element {{relation of the}} <b>model</b> <b>is</b> the actual element relation restricted to the <b>model.</b> A <b>model</b> <b>is</b> called transitive when it is standard and the base class is a transitive class of sets. A model of set theory is often assumed to be transitive unless it is explicitly stated that it <b>is</b> non-standard. Inner <b>models</b> <b>are</b> transitive, transitive <b>models</b> <b>are</b> standard, and standard <b>models</b> <b>are</b> well-founded.|$|R
