5|$|In January 2013 Goldacre {{joined the}} Cochrane Collaboration, British <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal</b> {{and others in}} setting up AllTrials, a {{campaign}} calling {{for the results of}} all past and current clinical trials to be reported.

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this report}} was to {{evaluate}} the Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> for their scientific influence according to the internationally recognized citation metrics indexes. Material and methods. Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> were analyzed, and eight of them fulfilled criteria for more detailed study of their scientific influence. Citation metrics indexes h-index, g-index, hc-index, hl-index, and hl, norm were performed using Publish or Perish, a software that retrieves and analyses academic citations. Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> were then compared to the Croat Med J. Results. Only three Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> were indexed in Medline/PubMed (Maked Med Pregl, God zb Med fak Skopje, and Prilozi) and only one is indexed in Index Copernicus (Maced J Med Sci). Most of Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> are not {{members of the international}} organizations and do not follow international standards for scientific publications. All Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> have 5 to 10 times smaller citation metrics indexes (h-index, g-index, hc-index, hI-index, and hI, norm) if compared with Croat Med J. There are not big differences in citation metrics indexes between Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals.</b> Conclusion. Macedonian <b>medical</b> <b>journals</b> have very limited scientific influence and their Editorial Boards are obliged to improve quality of their published manuscripts, and to adhere to international standards for scientific journals, which will result in their greater visibility and scientific influence...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera {{published}} {{the results of}} a nine-month investigation, which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat’s death suggested in several rumors could be true.

5|$|The protests were to no avail. The statue {{was quietly}} removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, {{accompanied}} by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand its return, {{but it was}} clear by then that Battersea Council had turned its back on the affair. The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the British <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal,</b> then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down. Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding its return, but the case was dismissed in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and her case has been {{discussed}} in the leading British <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> The Lancet. On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal.</b> With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E

5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal</b> of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal,</b> and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British <b>Medical</b> <b>Journal</b> in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first <b>medical</b> <b>journal</b> west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
