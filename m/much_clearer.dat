5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became <b>much</b> <b>clearer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

25|$|In telecommunications, {{frequency}} modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band {{frequency modulation}} radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E

Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul.

25|$|Émilie du Châtelet {{also made}} a {{translation}} of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories.

Despite numerous investigations and tests, the status of the Shroud of Turin remains murky, {{and the nature of the}} image and how it was fixed on the cloth remain puzzling.

25|$|Persia {{was a vast}} empire with {{a history}} that was already ancient {{before the arrival of}} Islam. Al-Mas‘udi was aware of the {{influence}} of ancient Babylon on Persia. He had access to a wealth of translations by scholars such as ibn al-Muqaffa from Middle Persian into Arabic. In his travels he also personally consulted Persian scholars and Zoroastrian priests. He thus had access to much material, factual and mythical. Like all other Arabic historians he was unclear on the Achaemenid dynasty, though he knew of Kurush (Cyrus the Great). He was <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> on the more recent dynasties and his estimation of the time between Alexander the Great and Ardashir is much more accurately depicted than it is in al-Tabari.|$|E

25|$|In 1669, Christian Huygens {{published}} his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant {{before and after}} the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his Horologium Oscillatorium, he gave a <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the borough}} of Telford & Wrekin, {{the town is}} entirely parished. Telford has no single town council because of this, and the Mayor of the Borough of Telford and Wrekin is also de facto the town's mayor. The town is also divided into Wards, within the Telford and Wrekin borough. These are used for electoral {{purposes}} and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically – but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent, smaller towns: Wellington, Madeley, Hadley, Oakengates, Dawley, Ironbridge and Donnington have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such {{as a part of}} Ironbridge and Broseley, while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by Shropshire Council.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{identification}} of Hnæf and Finn being brothers-in-law makes the situation <b>much</b> <b>clearer,</b> it shifts the emphasis of explanation onto the reason behind the subsequent battle. The battle may reflect a reoccurrence of the tensions which Hildeburh's marriage {{may have been a}} diplomatic move to quell. If {{the identification}} between the characters holds, moreover, then the son of Hildeburh and nephew of Hnæf who dies in the battle is probably therefore the son of Finn; he may even have been heir to the Frisian kingdom. In this respect it is especially notable that Hildeburh's son is laid on Hnæf's pyre. Tolkien suggested that Hildeburh's son was raised by Hnæf, and was being brought back to Finn at his coming of age; even that Hildeburh's son was one of the party besieged with Hnæf inside the great hall. Such a theory would add an extra layer of complexity, of a feeling of possible responsibility for filicide, to the already complicated psychological motivations of Finn.|$|E

25|$|In September 1942, the G-4 appeared; {{this version}} was {{identical}} to the G-2 in all respects, including performance, except for being fitted with the FuG 16 VHF radio set, which provided <b>much</b> <b>clearer</b> radio transmissions and had three-times {{the range of the}} earlier HF sets. Externally this could be recognised by the position of the fuselage antenna lead-in which was moved further aft to between frames seven and eight on the fuselage spine. Due to the steady weight increases of the 109, from the spring of 1943 larger 660×160mm (26×6.3in) mainwheels were introduced, replacing the previously used 650×150mm (25.6×6in) type. The undercarriage legs were altered so that the wheel's vertical axis was nearly upright rather than being parallel with the oleo leg. These changes resulted in the fitting of teardrop-shaped fairings to the upper wing surface above the wheel-wells to accommodate {{the upper part of the}} mainwheels. The larger wheels and fairings were often retrofitted to G-2s. In addition, a larger 350×135mm (14×5in) tailwheel replaced the original 290×110mm (11×4in) one; the larger tailwheel no longer fitted the recess, so the retraction mechanism was disconnected and the tailwheel fixed down. Up to July 1943, 1,242 G-4s were produced, with an additional four in Győr and WNF factories in the second half of 1943. Between January and February 1943, 50 examples of a pressurized version, the G-3 were also produced; similar to the G-1 although it was equipped with the same FuG 16 VHF radio set as the G-4.|$|E
