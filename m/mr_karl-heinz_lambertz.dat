50|$|Amel is {{the birthplace}} of <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz,</b> current leader (Minister-President) of the {{community}} executive of the German-speaking community of Belgium.|$|R
50|$|Between 2004 and 2014 he held several ministerial {{posts in}} the Government of the German-language Community. In June 2014 he {{replaced}} <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> as Minister-President of the German-speaking Community.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> {{has been}} a CoR member since 2001 and was President of the CoR's PES Group (2011- 2015). Since 2000, he {{has been a}} member of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in which he is {{currently}} Vice-President.|$|R
50|$|Elected for a two-and-a-half-year term at the plenary assembly, the President {{guides the}} Committee's work, chairs plenary {{sessions}} {{and is the}} CoR's official representative. <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (Belgium / Party of European Socialists, PES), Senator of the German-speaking Community of Belgium was elected President of the European Committee of the Regions on 12 July 2017.|$|R
50|$|The {{incumbent}} government, led by <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (SP), is {{a coalition}} of the Socialist Party (SP), the liberal Party for Freedom and Progress (PFF) and the regionalist ProDG. Only {{a few days after}} the elections, these parties agreed to continue their coalition government, but with Oliver Paasch (ProDG) as Minister-President since his party became bigger than SP.|$|R
50|$|The Socialist Party, {{the liberal}} Party for Freedom and Progress and the regionalist ProDG signed an {{agreement}} on 10 June 2009 to form the a coalition government. It {{is the first time}} in the history of the German-speaking Community that an outgoing government coalition succeeded itself. Under the terms of the agreement, <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (SP) remained Minister-President and Louis Siquet (SP) stayed on as Community Senator until January 2010, at which point he was replaced by a socialist.|$|R
50|$|The Walloon Region institutionally {{comprises}} {{also the}} German-speaking community of Belgium around Eupen, {{in the east}} of the region, next to Germany which ceded the area to Belgium after the First World War. Many of the 60,000 or so inhabitants of this very small community reject being considered as Walloon and - with their community executive leader <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> want to remain a federating unit, and to have all the powers of the Belgian Regions and Communities. Even if they do not want them absolutely and immediately (10 July 2008, official speech for the Flanders' national holiday).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (born 4 June 1952) is a Belgian {{politician}} {{holding a}} master's degree in Law (Université catholique de Louvain) {{with an additional}} specialisation in German Law (University of Heidelberg). He was the Minister-President of the German-speaking Community of Belgium for 15 years and became President of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community in 2014. Currently {{a member of the}} Belgian Senate representing the German-Speaking Community, he is also President of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) having been elected on 12 July 2017 after serving a two and a half year term as its First Vice-President.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} hours of 14 July 2008, {{after months of}} {{negotiations}} regarding constitutional reform {{and the status of}} the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde electoral district failed, and the deadline of 15 July 2008 neared without the hope of a result, Leterme offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king. After a series of consultations, King Albert II decided to reject Prime Minister Leterme's resignation on 17 July. The royal palace said that the King had asked two senior French-speaking politicians, François-Xavier de Donnéa (MR) and Raymond Langendries (CDH), and the Minister-President of the German-speaking Community, <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (SP), to establish how to start talks about institutional reform. They were expected to report back to the king {{by the end of the}} month. However, on 31 July 2008, they reported that they needed more time for the negotiations.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 May 2015, at the EU {{summit in}} Riga, Latvia, Juncker, {{alongside}} EU President Donald Tusk and Latvian PM Laimdota Straujuma, greeted EU leaders {{in a way}} unusual to diplomacy. For instance he tried to convince the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to wear a tie by offering his own piece. He also remarked on <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> being overweight and patted his belly. Juncker slapped his former deputy, the Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, as well as kissed Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel's bald head. But the most unexpected incident happened when Hungarian premier Viktor Orbán arrived and Juncker addressed him, using the expression [...] "my favourite dictator", following it with a warm handshake and a slight slap on the cheek. Later spokesperson Margaritis Schinas called the event only a [...] "joke". [...] "Juncker {{is known for his}} very informal style", he said and added [...] "I wouldn’t make anything else out of this".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Belgium {{was divided into}} four {{linguistic}} areas, the Dutch-speaking Flemish area, the French-speaking area, the bilingual capital of Brussels, and the German-speaking area of the east cantons. In 1973, three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy. The legislative Parliament of the German-speaking Community, , was set up. Today the German-speaking Community has a fair degree of autonomy, especially in language and cultural matters, but it still remains part of the region of predominantly French-speaking Wallonia. There has been much argument {{in the past few}} years that the German-speaking Community should also become its own region, which is an ongoing process with the permanent transfer with previous accord of some competences concerning social policy, conservation of sites and monuments, environment protection policy, transport, the financing of municipalities, among other things from the Walloon Region. One of the proponents of full regional autonomy for the German-speaking Community is <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz,</b> the minister-president from 1999 to 2014. Especially regional autonomy for spatial planning, city building and housing should be considered, according to the government of the German-speaking Community.|$|R
5000|$|An {{official}} {{coalition agreement}} was signed on 18 March 2008. Yves Leterme {{was sworn in}} on 20 March 2008. In the late hours of 14 July 2008, after months of negotiations regarding the constitutional reform and electoral arrondissement Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde failed and with the deadline of 15 July 2008 within reach, Leterme offered the resignation of his cabinet to King Albert II. After a series of consultations, King Albert II decided to reject Prime Minister Leterme's resignation on 17 July. The royal palace said that the King had asked two senior French-speaking politicians, Ministers of State François-Xavier de Donnea (MR) and Raymond Langendries (CdH), and the Minister-President of the German-speaking Community, <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> (SP), to establish how to start talks about institutional reform. [...] They reported back to the King on 19 September 2008 with a one-page report so that neither of the communities would {{back out of the}} negotiations. Only a few hours later, Didier Reynders angered the Dutch-speaking politicians with controversial statements and so sparked a crisis within the Flemish government. On 21 September 2008, the N-VA withdrew its parliamentary support for the federal government, saying that the 15-month-long negotiations had failed to result in state reform. The withdrawal of support plunged the country into another crisis. Under pressure of the socialist and liberal coalition partners, the only N-VA minister in the Flemish government (Geert Bourgeois) resigned his post.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{theoretical}} {{scenarios are}} usually {{considered in the}} event that a partition of Belgium would occur: remaining with Wallonia, sovereign statehood, reattachment to Germany, or attachment to Luxembourg. The community is part of the Walloon province of Liège and, per se, would stay so in case of partition. This status quo solution is the most probable, although it is uncertain whether or not the German-speakers could maintain their cultural and political rights in the long term in an otherwise monolingual francophone country. The other three possibilities would become realistic only if Wallonia were to seek unification with France. Since the community used to be part of Germany, [...] "reunification" [...] seems to be the logical step to take (the region borders the German states North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate). However, opponents to this idea argue that the autonomy of the region would be lost in Germany as much as it would in France. Therefore, and because of the strong cohesion of the regional population, some would prefer the creation of an independent state. They argue that the new country would, for example, be five times as large and more than twice as populous as Liechtenstein. Opponents say this would lead {{to the creation of a}} new undesired tax haven. The last option would be to merge with Luxembourg. Supporters of this scenario underline that many from St. Vith currently commute to Luxembourg and that a union with the rich Grand Duchy would be economically profitable. Minister president <b>Karl-Heinz</b> <b>Lambertz</b> has been said to have supported such a project. He, however, has refuted this and has committed himself to the continued union with Belgium. In an interview with the German TV-channel ZDF in February 2011, he listed the four aforementioned options concerning the future of the German-speaking Community.|$|R
