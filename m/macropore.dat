At the side where freezing initiates is a nearly isotropic region with no visible macropores dubbed the Initial Zone (IZ). Directly after the IZ is the Transition Zone (TZ), where macropores begin to form and align with one another. The pores in this region may appear randomly oriented. The third zone is called the Steady-State Zone (SSZ), macropores in this region are aligned {{with one another and}} grow in a regular fashion.

40|$|Understanding hillslope runoff {{response}} to intense rainfall {{is an important}} topic in hydrology, and is key to correct prediction of extreme stream flow, erosion and landslides. Although {{it is known that}} preferential flow processes activated by <b>macropores</b> are an important phenomena in understanding runoff processes inside a hillslope, hydrological models have generally not embraced the concept of an extra parameter that represents ‘macropores’ because of the complexity of the phenomenon. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the influence of <b>macropores</b> on runoff processes in an experimental small artificial hillslope. Here, we report on a controlled experiment where we could isolate the influence of <b>macropores</b> without the need for assumptions regarding their characteristics. Two identical hillslopes were designed, of which one was filled with artificial <b>macropores.</b> Twelve artificial rainfall events were applied to the two hillslopes and results of drainage and soil moisture were investigated. After the experiments, it could be concluded that the influence of <b>macropores</b> on runoff processes was minimal. The S 90 sand used for this research caused runoff to respond fast to rainfall, leading to little or no development of saturation near the <b>macropores.</b> In addition, soil moisture data showed a large amount of pendular water in the hillslopes, which implies that the soil has a low air entry value, and, in combination with the lack of vertical flow, could have caused the pressure difference between the matrix and the <b>macropores</b> to vanish sooner and result in equilibrium being reached in a relatively short time. Nevertheless, a better outline is given to determine a correct sand type for these types of experiments and, by using drainage recession analysis to investigate the influences of <b>macropores</b> on runoff, heterogeneity in rainfall intensity can be overcome.

Research has begun to attempt to model pathogen fate and transport, primarily through surface runoff mechanisms. A significant component of pathogen movement to streams commonly identified but not explicitly simulated in many models is pathogen movement to the subsurface, which can be important in several scenarios such as tile drainage systems. As colloidal contaminants, pathogens such as E. coli tend to become physically trapped in the soil matrix but can move quickly through soil <b>macropores.</b> In fact, concerns exist about the rapid transport of contaminants, such as pesticides, pathogens, and nutrients, from the soil surface to ground water through <b>macropores.</b> Recent research suggests short-circuiting or direct hydrologic connectivity between <b>macropores</b> and subsurface drains.

40|$|Investigating {{preferential}} flow, including <b>macropore</b> flow, {{is crucial}} to predicting and preventing point sources of contamination in soil, for example {{in the vicinity of}} pumping wells. With a view to advancing groundwater protection, this study aimed (i) to quantify the strength of <b>macropore</b> flow in four representative natural grassland soils on the Swiss plateau, and (ii) to define the parameters that significantly control <b>macropore</b> flow in grassland soil. For each soil type we selected three measurement points on which three successive irrigation experiments were carried out, resulting in a total of 36 irrigations. The strength of <b>macropore</b> flow, parameterized as the cumulated water volume flowing from macropores at a depth of 1 m in response to an irrigation of 60 mm h&# 8722; 1 intensity and 1 h duration, was simulated using the dual-permeability MACRO model. The model calibration was based on the key soil parameters and fine measurements of water content at different depths. Modelling results indicate high performance of <b>macropore</b> flow in all investigated soil types except in gleysols. The volume of water that flowed from macropores and was hence expected to reach groundwater varied between 81 % and 94 % in brown soils, 59 % and 67 % in para-brown soils, 43 % and 56 % in acid brown soils, and 22 % and 35 % in gleysols. These results show that spreading pesticides and herbicides in pumping well protection zones poses a high risk of contamination and must be strictly prohibited. We also found that organic carbon content was not correlated with the strength of <b>macropore</b> flow, probably due to its very weak variation in our study, while saturated water content showed a negative correlation with <b>macropore</b> flow. The correlation between saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and <b>macropore</b> flow was negative as well, but weak. <b>Macropore</b> flow appears to be controlled by the interaction between the bulk density of the uppermost topsoil layer (0 – 0. 10 m) and the macroporosity of the soil below.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the relationships between <b>macropore</b> network characteristics, hydraulic properties and state variables and measures of preferential transport in undisturbed columns sampled from four agricultural topsoils of contrasting texture and structure. <b>Macropore</b> network characteristics were computed from 3 -dimensional X-ray tomography images of the soil pore system. Non-reactive solute transport experiments were carried out at five steady-state water flow rates from 2 to 12 mm h − 1. The degree of preferential transport was evaluated by the normalised 5 % solute arrival time and the apparent dispersivity calculated from the resulting breakthrough curves. Near-saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured on the same samples using a tension disk infiltrometer placed {{on top of the}} columns. Results showed that many of the <b>macropore</b> network characteristics were inter-correlated. For example, large macroporosities were associated with larger specific <b>macropore</b> surface areas and better local connectivity of the <b>macropore</b> network. Generally, an increased flow rate resulted in earlier solute breakthrough and a shifting of the peak concentration towards smaller drained volumes. Columns with smaller macroporosities, poorer local connectivity of the <b>macropore</b> network and smaller near-saturated hydraulic conductivities exhibited a greater degree of preferential transport. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, with only two exceptions, global (i. e. sample-scale) continuity of the <b>macropore</b> network was still preserved at low macroporosities. Thus, for any given flow rate pores of larger diameter were actively conducting solute in soils of smaller near-saturated hydraulic conductivity. With less time for equilibration between the macropores and the surrounding matrix the transport became more preferential. Conversely, the large specific <b>macropore</b> surface area and well-connected <b>macropore</b> networks associated with columns with large macroporosities limit the degree of preferential transport because they increase the diffusive flux between macropores and the soil matrix and they increase the near-saturated hydraulic conductivity. The normalised 5 % arrival times were most strongly related with the estimated hydraulic state variables (e. g. with the degree of saturation in the macropores R 2 = 0. 589), since these combine into one measure the effects of irrigation rate and the near-saturated hydraulic conductivity function, which in turn implicitly depends on the volume, size distribution, global continuity, local connectivity and tortuosity of the <b>macropore</b> network...|$|E

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{carbon material}} containing nanopores (micropores and mesopores) and micrometric sized capillaries (<b>macropores)</b> is produced {{using a combination}} of hard and soft templates. The hard template is a polypropylene (PP) cloth which decomposes during pyrolysis leaving a macroporous structure. The soft template is a cationic polyelectrolyte which stabilizes the resorci-nol/formaldehyde (RF) resin porous structure during drying to give a nanoporous RF resin. The method produces a nanocomposite of the porous RF resin with an imbibed PP cloth. The composite is then pyrolyzed in a inert gas atmosphere to render a carbon material having <b>macropores</b> as well as micro/mesopores. The material exhibits both a large surface area (SBET = 742 ± 2 m 2 /g) due to nanopores and goof fluid permeability due to micrometric sized pores. The <b>macropores</b> can be oriented during fabrication. The nanoporous surface can be used to support metal nanoparticles for fuel cell while the <b>macropores</b> allow easy flux of gas and liquids through the monolithic material...|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{contamination}} of water supplies {{is now considered}} one of the top water quality issues in the United States and worldwide. Continual application of livestock manure may contribute to nonpoint source pollution by releasing microbial pathogens including bacteria, virus, and protozoa, through runoff and subsurface drainage water to surface and ground water. Many studies have been conducted in the laboratories and fields to understand the preferential flow through <b>macropores.</b> But no experiments in the field have been conducted to examine the breakthrough curve of pathogen and/or Escherichia coliform (E. coli) with directly connected <b>macropores.</b> The objective of this research is to address the transport of pathogens (specifically the indicator organism E. coli) through soils, and more specifically the role of <b>macropores</b> in the transport of E. coli to subsurface drains. A greater understanding and more theoretical modeling approach is needed to understand the role of directly connected <b>macropores</b> on pathogen transport to subsurface drainage...|$|R
