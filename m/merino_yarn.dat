40|$|A new testing {{approach}} using a mini-split Hopkinson tensile bar (mSHTB) {{was employed}} in the impact tests of Lincoln wool fibres and Merino wool yarns. Stress-strain curves of Lincoln wool fibres and Merino yarns subjected to impact loadings at strain rates {{in the order of}} 102 s- 1 were obtained, which fills the gap in the impact data for Lincoln wool fibres and Merino yarns. For comparison, quasi-static tests were also carried out with a single Lincoln wool fibre and <b>Merino</b> <b>yarn</b> using a Micro-Tester. The stress levels of fibres in impact tests were higher than those in the quasi-static tests and the stress level increased with strain rates. The same trend was found in force for Merino yarns. The quantitative relation between stress and strain rate of Lincoln wool fibre was expressed by a Cowper-Symonds relation. Empirical quantitative relation between the force and strain rate of <b>Merino</b> <b>yarn</b> was also obtained...|$|E
