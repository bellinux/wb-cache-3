25|$|Silk is {{a natural}} protein fiber, some forms {{of which can be}} woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is {{composed}} mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the <b>mulberry</b> <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Sericulture is an agro based industry, playing {{an important role in}} community of the world. An assessment was conducted to assess the silkworm production and identify the major constraints for silkworm raring in eastern Tigray from February to May, 2014. Primary data on type of silk worm, food (host) plants of silkworm used, annual income and major constrains were collected from silk worm rears using semi structure interview. Two types of silk worms were identified namely, mulberry and eri silk worms. Mulberry silk worm was more adapted to the study area. The main food or host plants were mulberry for <b>mulberry</b> <b>silkworm</b> and castor for eri silk worm, respectively. The average annual silk production ranges from 100 to 500 kg of silk. <b>Mulberry</b> <b>silkworm</b> produces higher kilograms of silk and income per year than eri silkworm. The major constraints were lack of food or host plants, drought, lack of knowledge such as training, lack modern house, lack of market availability, lack of governmental and nongovernmental support, lack wide area, lack of silk worm production materials and seasonal environmental condition fluctuation. Despite all the constraints, the area has great potential for silk production. Therefore, the people should be aware on silk worm farming and the government also fulfills the facilities for high potential of silk production at regional and federal level...|$|E
