40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) prepared from electroactive materials show great potential for <b>multicolor</b> <b>display</b> and white light source applications. Unfortunately, the commercialization of multilayer OLEDs has been slow. This can be attributed {{in part to the}} vapor deposition technique used to assemble small molecule thin films. The process is not amenable to large area displays and is relatively costly. An attractive alternative solution to this problem is to replace small molecules with organic polymers, which could be solution processed in an efficient and economical manner. Polymeric materials also offer the unique potential to achieve nanoscale self-assembled structures through their functional architecture. These materials can be solution processed and mimic multilayered small molecule devices to achieve improved performance and/or balanced color. Design and synthesis and OLED testing of functional polymers which can achieve defined multilayer or nanostructured film characteristics through simple solution processing is the focus of this thesis. 	In Chapter 1, the history of OLED materials as well as the device mechanism and key organic electronic characteristics necessary for high performance devices is introduced. There is also a discussion on the methods for device testing and characterization. 	The design and synthesis of novel dendronized linear polymer host materials is presented in Chapter 2. These polymers should possess a rigid linear rod like architecture which had not been investigated for its potential to order a thin film in an assembly of cylindrical structures. This host material was desired in order to optimize the interface of hole and electron transporting material to achieve improved recombination in the thin film. 	Similarly, in Chapter 3 a diblock copolymer architecture is studied as host material in OLED devices. In this work the differences between nanoscale self assembled diblock copolymers of hole and electron transporting units and random copolymers of the same composition are studied. These materials show a high external quantum efficiency of 5. 6 % for a simply prepared single layer device which is enabled by the self-assembly of the functional diblock copolymer architecture. 	In Chapter 4, these diblock copolymers are exploited not only to create nanoscale domains of hole and electron transporting domains but also to organize the site isolation of two different colored phosphorescent emitters. Polymerizable heteroleptic iridium complexes of different color were developed and covalently incorporated into separate blocks of the diblock copolymer. Following the self assembly of thin film morphology through simple spin coating, the energy transfer from blue to red emitters was greatly reduced enabling synergistic dual emission for white electroluminescence. 	Chapter 5 discusses the design and synthesis of electroactive crosslinked polymer nanoparticles with nanoscale size that can achieve the site isolation of emitters. Using different polymerizable iridium complexes, batches of different colored polymer nanoparticles can be simply prepared and mixed at the device preparation stage in any ratio to yield tunable colored devices. These nanoparticles dispersions behave as {{light emitting}} inks which can be simply solution processed with predictable and stable electroluminescent color. 	In Chapter 6, difunctional polymerizable iridium complexes are used to achieve multilayer structures of electron blocking layers and phosphorescent emissive layers. These small molecules can be solution processed to yield thin films which can be crosslinked through simple heating step. A subsequent layer can then be deposited on top to build up all solution processed multilayered devices. A select high triplet energy crosslinkable iridium complex was shown to perform well as an electron blocker and hole transporting layer in OLEDs with improved performance over the standard water soluble hole transporting layer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) ...|$|E

One of the problems still remaining is to obtain narrow emission bands at the three primary colors red, green, and blue for <b>multicolor</b> <b>displays.</b> White-light OLEDs can be realized {{using a combination of}} three emitter layers or fabricating a multimode microcavity device, but there is still no single fluorescent organic material producing white light. Due to the relatively broad bands of the organic dyes, mixed colors cannot be reached satisfactorly. One way to realize nearly monochromatic light sources is the use of fluorescent lanthanide complexes [4]. It has also been shown that the electroluminescence spectrum can be narrowed and the emission intensity can be enhanced by incooporating the light emitting diodes into a Fabry-Perot microcavity structure [...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose. When {{the targets}} or the {{background}} {{in a display}} are different colors, longitudinal chromatic aberration ensures {{that there is no}} single correct accommodative response. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether the response becomes more variable when viewing certain <b>multicolor</b> <b>displays.</b> Methods. Accommodative responses of five young participants were measured with a dynamic infrared optometer while they viewed steady targets at a nominal stimulus level of 3 D. Target-on-background color combinations were black on white, black on blue, black on red, blue on red, red on blue, dark blue on red, and dark red on blue. Results. When compared with the standard black-on-white target, responses to targets with reduced spectral bandwidth were not significantly more variable. In most participants, responses to near-isoluminant targets (e. g., red on blue and blue on red) were not more variable than to the standard target. However, calculated confidence intervals cannot rule out moderate to large changes in variability near isoluminance. Responses to these multicolor targets tended to favor the blue focus. Conclusions. In most individuals, viewing multichromatic targets does not increase significantly the variation in accommodative response as compared with broadband black-and-white targets...|$|R

40|$|A new and {{synthetically}} versatile {{strategy has}} been developed for the phosphorescence color tuning of cyclometalated iridium phosphors by simple tailoring of the phenyl ring of ppy (Hppy= 2 -phenylpyridine) with various main-group moieties in [Ir(ppy-X) (2) (acac) ] (X=B(Mes) (2), SiPh 3, GePh 3, NPh 2, POPh 2, OPh, SPh, SO 2 Ph).

To establish wider usage, achieving multicolor and high-resolution characteristics is indispensable. In this paper, we demonstrated that the introduction of substituents such as methyl groups into bipyridine units changed the stereostructure of the cation radicals, and thus shifted the color (e. g., ordinary purple to blue). Also, by relaxing excessive π-stacking between the viologen moieties, the response rate was improved {{by a factor of}} more than 10. The controlled charge transport throughout the polyviologen layer gave rise to the fabrication of EC displays which are potentially suitable for the thin film transistor (TFT) substrate as the counter electrodes with submillimeter pixels.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of size controlled ZnO and rare-earth doped ZnO nanorods in the sub- 10 nm diameter regime. The preferential anisotropic growth of the nanostructures along the polar c-axis leads {{to the formation of}} wurtzite phase ZnO nanorods. Photoluminescence measurements reveal enhancement of visible luminescence intensity with increasing RE 3 + concentrations upon excitation of host ZnO into the band gap. The broad visible luminescence originates from multiple intrinsic or extrinsic defects. The luminescence from RE 3 + is enabled by energy transfer from defect centers of the host nanocrystal lattice to dopant sites. Host-guest energy transfer facilitates efficient intra- 4 f orbital transitions (D- 5 (4) -> F- 7 (j) for Tb 3 + and D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (j) for Eu 3 +) related characteristic green or red emission. Interestingly, different decay rates of host defects and RE 3 + emission transition also allow temporal control to achieve either pure green or red color. This study suggests that manipulation of defects through bottom-up techniques is a viable method to modulate the energy transfer dynamics, which may help enable the future applications of ZnO-based phosphor materials in optoelectronic and <b>multicolor</b> emission <b>displays...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the study of pulsed second-harmonic generation under conditions of phase and group velocity mismatch, and generally low conversion efficiencies and pump intensities. In positive-index, nonmetallic materials, we generally find qualitative agreement with previous reports regarding the presence of a double-peaked second harmonic signal, which comprises a pulse that walks off and propagates at the nominal group velocity one expects at the second-harmonic frequency, and a second pulse that is "captured" and propagates under the pump pulse. We find that the origin of the double-peaked structure resides in a phase-locking mechanism that characterizes not only second-harmonic generation, but also chi((3)) processes and third-harmonic generation. The phase-locking mechanism that we describe occurs for arbitrarily small pump intensities, and so it is not a soliton effect, which usually relies on a threshold mechanism, although <b>multicolor</b> solitons <b>display</b> similar phase locking characteristics. Thus, in second harmonic generation a phase-matched component is always generated, even under conditions of material phase mismatch: This component is anomalous, because the material does not allow energy exchange between the pump and the second-harmonic beam. On the other hand, if the material is phase matched, phase locking and phase matching are indistinguishable, and the conversion process becomes efficient. We also report a similar phase-locking phenomenon in negative index materials. A spectral analysis of the pump and the generated signals reveals that the phase-locking phenomenon causes the forward moving, phase-locked second-harmonic pulse to experience the same negative index as the pump pulse, even though the index of refraction at the second-harmonic frequency is positive. Our analysis further shows that the reflected second-harmonic pulse generated at the interface and the forward-moving, phase-locked pulse appear {{to be part of the}} same pulse initially generated at the surface, part of which is immediately back-reflected, while the rest becomes trapped and dragged along by the pump pulse. These pulses thus constitute twin pulses generated at the interface, having the same negative wave vector, but propagating in opposite directions. Almost any break of the longitudinal symmetry, even an exceedingly small chi((2)) discontinuity, releases the trapped pulse which then propagates in the backward direction. These dynamics are indicative of very rich and intricate interactions that characterize ultrashort pulse propagation phenomena...|$|R

S. patents published or issued during the years 1977 - 2004 in the foundational knowledge domain of electroluminescent materials and phenomena. The dataset was created using a complex, iteratively developed search string. The records in the dataset were then partitioned according to: whether they are articles or patents, their publication or issue date, their national or continental origin, whether the active electroluminescent material was inorganic or organic, and which of a number of emergent knowledge sub-domains they aggregate into on the basis of bibliographic coupling. From these partitionings, we performed a number of analyses, including: identification of knowledge sub-domains of historical and recent importance, and trends over time of the contributions of various nations and continents to the knowledge domain and its sub-domains. Among the key results: (1) The knowledge domain as a whole has been growing quickly: the average growth rates of the inorganic and organic knowledge sub-domains have been 8 %/yr and 25 %/yr, respectively, compared to average growth rates less than 5 %/yr for English-language articles and U. S. patents in other knowledge domains. The growth rate of the organic knowledge sub-domain is so high that its historical dominance by the inorganic knowledge sub-domain will, at current trajectories, be reversed in the coming decade. (2) Amongst nations, the U. S. is the largest contributor to the overall knowledge domain, but Japan is on a trajectory to become the largest contributor within the coming half-decade. Amongst continents, Asia became the largest contributor during the past half-decade, overwhelmingly so for the organic knowledge sub-domain. (3) The relative contributions to the article and patent datasets differ for the major continents: North America contributing relatively more patents, Europe contributing relatively more articles, and Asia contributing in a more balanced fashion. (4) For the article dataset, the nations that contribute most in quantity also contribute most in breadth, while the nations that contribute less in quantity concentrate their contributions in particular knowledge sub-domains. For the patent dataset, North America and Europe tend to contribute improvements in end-use applications (e. g., in sensing, phototherapy and communications), while Asia tends to contribute improvements at the materials and chip levels. (5) The knowledge sub-domains that emerge from aggregations based on bibliographic coupling are roughly organized, for articles, by the degree of localization of electrons and holes in the material or phenomenon of interest, and for patents, according to both their emphasis on chips, systems or applications, and their emphasis on organic or inorganic materials. (6) The six 'hottest' topics in the article dataset are: spintronics, AlGaN UV LEDs, nanowires, nanophosphors, polyfluorenes and electrophosphorescence. The nine 'hottest' topics in the patent dataset are: OLED encapsulation, active-matrix <b>displays,</b> <b>multicolor</b> OLEDs, thermal transfer for OLED fabrication, ink-jet printed OLEDs, phosphor-converted LEDs, ornamental LED packages, photocuring and phototherapy, and LED retrofitting lamps. A significant caution in interpreting these results is that they are based on English-language articles and U. S. patents, and hence will tend to over-represent the strength of English-speaking nations (particularly the U. S.), and under-represent the strength of non-English-speaking nations (particularly China) ...|$|R
