They are: (i) Gambusia affinis - mosquito fish, (ii) Lebistes reticulatus -guppies, (iii) Tilapia mossambica - tilapia, (iv) Kuhlia sandvicensis - aholehole, and (v) Stolephorus purpureus - nehu. Of the five species, Gambusia affinis had the highest tolerance to the toxic agents used in this study. Lebistes reticulatus and Tilapia mossambica had approximately the same sensitivity to DDT as well as dieldrin and lindane.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{series of}} log storage {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether leachates derived from water storage of logs are acutely toxic to fish. Log segments approximately 18 inches long and 16 inches in diameter were stored in tanks and held submerged {{for a period of}} 7 days. The holding water containing leached materials was made toxic with mercury to retard biological decomposition of the leached substances. Mercury was selectively removed from leachate samples by chelation prior to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and bioassay testing. Trout and salmon fry were subjected to the leachate water in short term acute bioassay tests. Results are reported as a <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit,</b> (TLm), i. e., the concentration of leachate at which 50 percent of the test fish died for any given exposure time. Leachates were also tested for BOD₅, BOD k-rate, chemical oxygen demand (COD), wood sugar and Pearl Benson Index (PBI). Test results show that leachates from Douglas fir stored in fresh water exert a slight acute toxicity to fish. A TLm₉₆ of 20 percent leachate by volume, for a 50 year old Douglas fir log, was the most toxic leachate observed. Leachates from ponderosa pine, hemlock and an older fir log stored under identical conditions produced no measurable acute toxicity. Leachates contained a significant quantity of BOD and PBI exerting substances. The highest BOD₅, (1. 36 g/ft² of submerged surface area) was exerted by leachate from a ponderosa pine log segment stored with bark removed. The highest PBI valve (12. 5 g/ft²), was observed for leachate from a young Douglas fir log segment. BOD:COD ratios and BOD k-rate ranged widely for the various leachates, but were relatively low which indicated a significant fraction of non-biodegradable substances. Hoffbuhr (9) also observed a high non-biodegradable fraction in samples taken from log storage ponds. Wood sugars were found to account for {{a large part of the}} degradable portion of leachates.

40|$|Increased {{utilization}} of sea water for cooling purpose in electricity generating industry {{and in other}} industrial processes has made it necessary to consider the biological influences of its effluents on marine life in the adjacent area. Hence, as the direct influences of the effluents, the lethal points of high temperature and residual chlorine for marine planktonic larvae in various exposure periods were studied. The experiments against high temperature were performed with the purple sea urckin (Anthocidaries crassipina) larvae in early stage (2 - 4 cells), blastula stage and pluteus stage, with the rock barnacle (Balanus amphitrite albicostatus) larvae in nauplius stage, and with the oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae in blastula stage. The lethal influences of residual chlorine on the blue mussele (mytilus edulis) in early stage (2 - 4 cells) and trochophore stage were studied in detail {{in relation to the}} exposure periods. Results obtained are as follows. 1) As shown in Table 3, early stage larvae of the purple sea urckin have the least tolerance to high temperature among the examined larval animals. They cannot survive the treatment at the temperature of 33 ℃ for 20 minutes. Nauplius II larvae of the rock barnacle have the most tolerance to high temperature being able to tolerate 40 minutes' treatment at 40 ℃. 2) TLm (<b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit)</b> of chlorine for the blue mussele larvae for 5 and 10 minutes exposure periods are shown in Fig. 1. The 10 min-TLm values for early stage larvae (2 - 4 cells) and for trochophore stage larvae and the 5 min-TLm value for early stage larvae are shown as 1. 15, 1. 31 and 1. 21 ppm., respectively. The differences among these values are minimal. However, the 5 min-TLm value for trochophore stage larvae, 2. 37 ppm. is considerably high as compared with the other TLm values, Accordingly, it is clear that within 5 min exposure period, the blue mussele larvae in late stage become more tolerate to chlorine along with the larval development. These results suggest that within the extent of this experimental studty, heated effluents in electricity generating industry facing the open sea may not bring at least the direct influences on marine planktonic larvae in the vicinity on account of their rapid diffusion. ムラサキウニ,マガキ,シロスジフジツボ,ムラサキイガイを用い,それらの幼生に及ぼす高温と塩素の影響を検討した. その結果 1) 高温の影響はTable 3 に示したように,ムラサキウニの発生初期が最も抵抗性が小さく,約 33 ℃に 20 分放置すると死滅する. 一方,シロスジフジツボのII期ナウプリウスは最も強く, 40 ℃に 40 分放置しても死滅することはない. 2) ムラサキイガイ幼生に及ぼす遊離塩素の影響は,受精初期の 5 分間と 10 分間のTLmおよびトロコホア期の 10 分間TLmは,それぞれ 1. 21, 1. 15 および 1. 31 ppmで,大きな差はないが,発生が進み,トロコホア期になると,短時間の作用ではかなり高濃度にも耐えうるようになり, 10 分間TLmは 2. 37 ppmになる. 3) 以上の事実から,火力発電所の温排水が付近海域の海産浮游幼生に,少くとも,直接的な影響を及ぼす可能性は少ないと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The acute {{toxicity}} of Diquat (1 : 1 -ethylene- 2 : 2 ' dipyridylium dibromide) and Dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile) to six selected pond invertebrates was determined using the <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> estimation method. Diquat was more toxic to the amphipod, Hyalella azeteca {{than to the}} aquatic insects Callibaetis, Limnephilus, Enallagma, Libellula, and Tendipedidae. The addition of mud to the test vessels reduced the toxicity to H. azeteca over 96 hours. The invertebrates were generally more tolerant to diquat than the fishes, Micropterus salmoides and Lepomis macrochirus. Dichlobenil formed a concentrated layer {{on the bottom of}} the test vessels and was more toxic to Tendipedidae than to the free swimming invertebrates. Dichlobenil appeared to have a narcotizing or turnover effect which was recorded as an IC₅₀ immobilization concentration. The addition of mud to the test aquaria did not change the toxicity. Formulation differences were apparent with the four percent granules exhibiting a 48 -hour "lag" before an effective concentration was obtained equalivalent to the toxic effect of the 50 percent wettable powder. There was a greater toxic action with time for the invertebrates when compared to the fishes, M. salmoides and L. macrochirus. A field study was designed to determine the effects of the two chemicals at the recommended field application rates to pond invertebrates and aquatic plants. A split-plot statistical design was incorporated by dividing ponds into plots with polyethylene sheeting. Diquat killed all submerged plants within two weeks; however, the control was only temporary with regrowth beginning immediately. A reduction in dissolved oxygen was noted for ten days after treatment followed by an increase associated with heavy algal blooms. Diquat caused a reduction in H. azeteca associated with {{acute toxicity}}. Tendipedidae, Coenagrionidae, Libellulidae, Baetidae, and Sialidae were not reduced by the chemical. Dichlobenil acted slowly over a period of weeks to reduce submergent and emergent plant growth. Filamentous algae was completely controlled. Nine months after treatment less than a five percent regrowth of plants was noted in the plots. No major reduction in dissolved oxygen was noted following treatment. A reduction in Tendipedidae occurred associated with acute toxicity. Alteration of preferred habitat resulting from treatment reduced Coenagrionidae and Callibaetis. Libellulidae and H. azeteca were unaffected. Statistical evaluation of the experimental design indicated that pond divisions were effective in reducing needed replications and provided for a better estimate for treatment comparisons. The "power of test" formula for detecting differences indicated that the sample size could be reduced in future experiments for detection of a 50 percent difference at the 95 percent level...|$|E

A temperature-controlled, serial dilution unit designed to provide eight successive 2 : 1 dilutions and its actual performance are described. Marine organisms were collected in waters free of pollutants and tested at the Marine Sciences Research Laboratory. The three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, were assayed to determine <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> (TLm) and to compare the effects of two types of colloidal phosphorus formulations: phossy water from the Electric Reduction Company of Canada plant at Long Harbour and, colloidal dispersions of pure phosphorus (P₄) prepared in the laboratory. The 48 hour TLm values for stickleback and cod at 8. 0 °C are 190 ugm/L. and 27 ugm/L. respectively in ERCO phossy water; the 48 and 96 hour TLm's in pure P₄ dispersions at 8. 0 °C are 185 ugm/L. and 68 ugm/L. for stickleback and 28 ugm/L. and 16 ugm/L. P₄ for the cod. In bioassays conducted on the winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, the 48 and 96 hour TLm's are 70 ugm/L. and 25 ugm/L. P₄ respectively. Temperature affects the toxicity of yellow phosphorus to the three-spined stickleback, while particles of P₄ greater than 0. 8 microns have little or no effect on the same species. ERCO phossy water retards the righting response of the northern starfish, Asterias vulgaris, at concentrations lower than those required for lethality. Dispersions of phosphorus affects the hematocrit of the cod and winter flounder as well as the white cell count of the cod.

The KME {{used in these}} studies was obtained from two pulp and paper mills producing paper from unbleached pulp. Samples were collected weekly during the experimental periods from settling lagoons of mill A, and waste outfalls of mill B. Acute toxicity bioassays of these wastes were performed periodically, and 96 -hour <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> (TL[subscript m]) were estimated for the salmon and for guppies (Poecilia reticulata Peters). Water and wastes were introduced into 16 experimental chambers by a system of head boxes and siphons. In each experiment, growth rates of salmon continuously exposed to three waste concentrations and of controls were evaluated at four different feeding levels. The waste concentrations were adjusted so as to provide for nearly constant increments of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Tubificid worms were the food organism in all experiments. The feeding levels employed ranged from an unrestricted ration, through several restricted rations, to starvation. The growth rates of salmon {{were found to be}} reduced at all concentrations of KME from mill A (0. 5 to 4. 0 mg/liter BOD) when the ration was unrestricted, and were reduced at all concentrations with BOD increments greater than 0. 5 mg/liter when the next lower ration was fed. Some death occurred within 16 days at all feeding levels at concentrations having a BOD increment of 4. 0 mg/liter. At low feeding levels, no consistent differences in growth attributable to KME were observed. Dilutions of waste from mill B had only small effects on the growth of chinook salmon. Salmon held in clean water and fed worms which had been exposed to KME from mill A showed only slight decreases in growth rate, except when they were fed worms exposed to 100 -percent effluent which reduced the efficiency of food utilization considerably. When salmon were exposed to two concentrations of KME from mill A and then tested for swimming ability, no differences of maximum sustained swimming speeds attributable to the wastes were found. Except at the 4. 0 mg/liter BOD level of waste from mill A, no reduction in the appetite of salmon exposed to KME was found in the growth experiments. Any reductions in the growth rates observed can be attributed to KME-caused decreases of the efficiency of food utilization for growth. The higher metabolic rates of the fish kept on the high ration presumably were responsible for the increased effects of the KME on these fish...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A reliable, easy, and {{inexpensive}} method for determination of molecular hydrocyanic acid (HCN) in solutions of simple and complex metal cyanides is described. The method {{was used to}} determine molecular HCN concentrations as low as 0. 005 milligram per liter, and can be used for determination of even lower levels. It is a modification of a previously published method. A concentration column of glass beads coated with NaOH is employed, on which HCN displaced by air that has been bubbled through solutions under examination is trapped and concentrated for measurement of cyanide by a conventional analytical method. The apparatus could easily be modified for use in both field and laboratory situations where only limited facilities are available. Time periods required for attainment of equilibria upon dilution of solutions of metal-cyanide complexes, and also when metal salts and free cyanide are combined, were quite variable and ranged from several hours for the silver-cyanide complex to many months for iron-cyanide complexes kept in the dark. In solutions in which CuCN and NaCN were combined so that the molar ratio of CN to Cu was either 2. 5 to 1 or 3 to 1, constancy of the HCN concentration usually was not attained even 110 days after preparation. The time to attainment of equilibrium through dissociation of the nickelocyanide complex ions generally was longer than that required for equilibrium to be attained in comparable experiments on complex formation, and it increased as the pH or the total cyanide concentration decreased; it {{is directly related to the}} percentage of total cyanide present as HCN at equilibrium. Results obtained at high total cyanide concentrations in nickelocyanide formation experiments were anomalous but verifiable by bioassay with fish. The HCN concentrations were at first unexpectedly low and then increased very slowly to the higher equilibrium levels. Cumulative dissociation constants (K[subscript D]) at 20 °C for the Ag(CN) ₂⁻, Cu(CN) ₂⁻, Ni(CN) ₄⁻², Fe(CN) ₆⁻⁴, and Fe(CN) ₆⁻³ complex ions, calculated from equilibrium levels of HCN, are 1. 94 ± 2. 82 x 10 ⁻¹⁹, 3. 94 ± 1. 75 x 10 ⁻²⁴, 1. 00 ± 0. 37 x 10 ⁻³¹, approximately 10 ⁻⁴⁷, and 10 ⁻⁵², respectively. The calculated constants for the tetracyanonickelate (II) and dicyanoargentate (I) complex ions inexplicably varied somewhat, increasing slightly with increase in total cyanide concentration and pH. Those for the tetracyanonickelate (II) and dicyanocuprate (I) complex ions showed close agreement with values recently reported in the literature, whereas the constants for the dicyanoargentate (I) and hexacyanoferrate (II) and (III) complex ions were materially different from presently accepted values. Possible unreliability of presently accepted stepwise constants for the cuprocyanide complex ions also was indicated. The acute toxicity of solutions of the different metal-cyanide complexes was generally found to be a function of the molecular HCN level, which increases with increase of total cyanide concentration and with decrease of pH. In some solutions however, a metal-cyanide complex ion per se was shown to be the major toxic component. The 48 -hour <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for bluegills of the dicyanoargentate (I) and dicyanocuprate (I) ions at 20 °C were found to be approximately 9 and 4 mg/l as CN, respectively. The metallocyanide complex ions studied can be arranged in order of decreasing toxicity as follows: Cu(CN) ₂⁻, Ag(CN) ₂⁻, Ni(CN) ₄⁻², and Fe(CN) ₆⁻³ or Fe(CN) ₆⁻⁴. A published empirical relationship between pH and 48 -hour <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> of the nickelocyanide complex for a fish, determined without assurance that equilibria had been attained in test solutions, was compared with a calculated, theoretical relationship. Considerable divergence of the empirical and theoretical curves at pH values less than about 7. 2 is ascribable mostly to the introduction of fish into test solutions long before equilibria had been attained in the solutions of low pH. Divergence at pH values greater than about 7. 8 is attributable largely to moderate toxicity of the Ni(CN) ₄⁻² complex ion itself. Slightly alkaline solutions of the silver cyanide complex, Ag(CN) ₂⁻, become more toxic to sticklebacks with increase of chlorinity. The high toxicity in saline solutions, as compared with the toxicity in fresh water, is clearly attributable, at least in part or in some instances, to a molecular HCN content of the saline solutions much greater than that of comparable solutions prepared with fresh water. The two ligands CN⁻ and Cl⁻ compete for the silver ion, with which both ligands form complexes, and dissociation of the Ag(CN) ₂⁻ ion, with production of HCN, consequently increases as the Cl⁻ ion concentration increases. Additional reasons for the observed increase of toxicity of solutions of the complex with increase of chlorinity can be an observed increase of the toxicity of HCN and a possible, similar increase of the toxicity of the complex ion. Experiments with ¹⁴C-labeled cyanide complexed with nickel showed that the complex does not penetrate readily into the body of a bluegill. The ¹⁴C accumulated in gill tissues much more markedly than it did in the blood and in tissues of internal organs sampled. When bluegills were exposed to solutions of the cyanide complexes of copper (I) and silver (I), considerable amounts of the metals accumulated in the blood and in tissues of internal organs, but little accumulation in gill tissues was observed. These results indicate that the cuprocyanide and silver-cyanide complexes enter the body of a bluegill much more readily than does the much less toxic nickelocyanide complex. The silver cation, however, apparently enters even more readily than does the silver-cyanide complex anion, the silver accumulating most markedly in the gill tissues of bluegills exposed to silver nitrate solutions, but also in their internal organ tissues...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{pollution}} of {{water has been}} documented in Japan and in several Scandinavian countries. No information was available {{on the status of}} North American waters with regard to mercury pollution at the time this work was begun. Muscle tissue from 81 fish from nine locations in the Saskatchewan River contained an average of more than 1. 0 ppm of mercury. Fish from two of the sites had much higher concentrations, with individual fish containing up to 11. 2 ppm of mercury. These concentrations correspond to values reported for Scandinavian fish collected in areas of industrial pollution. The acute toxicity of methyl mercury chloride (MeHgC 1) for rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) fry and fingerlings was measured. The <b>median</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> (TLm) at 24, 48 and 96 hr was 0. 084, 0. 045 and 0. 024 mg/litre as mercury respectively for fry; and 0. 125, 0. 066 and 0. 042 mg/litre as mercury respectively for fingerlings. The TLm (24 hr) for mercuric chloride (HgC 12) for fingerlings was 0. 90 mg/litre as mercury. Fingerlings exposed to MeHgC 1 concentrated mercury in their tissues much more rapidly than did those exposed to HgC 12. The acute toxic action of MeHgCl and HgC 12 was exerted on the gills. Mercuric chloride caused severe epithelial necrosis. Poisoning with MeHgCl was characterized by epithelial cell swelling and hyperplasia, a marked {{increase in the number of}} epithelial cells in mitosis and terminally, epithelial desquamation. Rainbow trout fingerlings were fed rations containing 4, 8, 16 and 24 ppm mercury as MeHgCl over a 105 day period. Fish receiving the 16 and 24 ppm rations had significantly higher blood packed cell volumes than controls. Hyperplasia of the gill epithelium was the only morphologic alteration in these fish. Individual fish accumulated up to 30 ppm mercury in muscle, but no mortality which could be attributed to mercury poisoning occurred. The results suggest that trout can tolerate a large body burden of mercury, if this mercury is acquired over a period of time. Female and juvenile mink (Mustela vison) were fed rations containing 50 and 75 per cent of fish containing 0. 44 ppm mercury over a 145 day period. There was no evidence of intoxication in these animals. Mercury concentrations in tissue appeared to have reached equilibrium at a level below that associated with toxicity. Adult mink were fed rations containing 1. 1, 1. 8, 4. 8, 8. 3 and 15. 0 ppm mercury as MeHgCl over a 93 day period. Histologic evidence of injury was present in all groups. Mink fed rations containing 1. 8 to 15. 0 ppm mercury developed clinical intoxication within the experimental period. The rapidity of onset of intoxication was directly related to the mercury content of the ration. Mercury concentrations in tissues of mink which died were similar, despite differences in the mercury content of the diets and time to death. The average mercury concentration in the brain of mink which died was 11. 9 ppm. The disease produced by MeHgCl was primarily related to neuronal necrosis. Cortical neurons and those in certain subcortical nuclei were most susceptible. In acute intoxication neuronal damage was diffuse throughout the brain. Involvement of granular cells of the cerebellum and peripheral nerve fibres was seen in acutely poisoned animals...|$|E

Under the logistic regression model with fixed effects for binary responses, point-wise and simultaneous tolerance intervals are derived {{for the number}} of positive responses among a specified number of Bernoulli trials. Under the logistic regression model with mixed effects, point-wise <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are derived. The problems were motivated by a ballistic application dealing with testing the ballistic resistance of personal body armor. Methodologies used for the derivation of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under the logistic regression model include small sample asymptotics and the bootstrap. Numerical results are reported to assess the accuracy of the proposed methodologies, and they are also illustrated using examples on the ballistic response of armor plates, where it is known that the ballistic response depends on covariates such as the velocity of the projectile. A second set of problems investigated include the computation of upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under zero-inflated log-normal and zero-inflated gamma distributions. Models without covariates and with covariates are separately considered, and point-wise upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are derived under models with covariates. For the zero-inflated log-normal model, techniques used to calculate the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> include generalized pivotal quantities (GPQs), fiducial quantities, the bootstrap, and the delta method with a bootstrap calibration. Numerical results indicate that the GPQ methodology and the bootstrap calibration of the delta method provide very satisfactory performance. For the zero-inflated gamma model, <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are calculated based on bootstrapping a pivot-like statistic, and based on the bootstrap calibration of the delta method. Once again, numerical results indicate satisfactory performance. The results are applied to a variety of zero-inflated data sets: health expenditure data, rainfall data, and body armor protection data. The final topic investigated is the derivation of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under some mixture models. The normal-normal and lognormal-normal mixture models are first explored. Models with three and four mixtures of normal distributions and the normal-normal regression model are then investigated. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under all of these mixture models are obtained based on a bootstrap calibration of the delta method. This approach produced good results for all the models examined. The case of two mixtures was motivated by an application dealing with the evaluation of the safety of nuclear power plants based on data that are outputs of computer codes used to simulate nuclear accidents. Traditionally, non-parametric <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are used for this purpose, but the data clearly indicated a mixture distribution: normal-normal or lognormal-normal. Upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> computed under the mixture model turned out to be smaller compared to the non-parametric upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit.</b> Extensive numerical results and a variety of examples are also included...|$|R

The use of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> and its variations, which describe the concentration and extremes of a distribution, provide useful methods to evaluate laboratory data. The theory of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for the gaussian distribution and any unknown continuous distribution ispresented. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> provide adequate data reduction while still allowing appropriate interpretation of the results and are useful for evaluating individual patient responses.

5000|$|The diameters of the {{cartridge}} are, logically, {{smaller than the}} appropriate diameters of the chamber. But the corresponding lengths [...] "L1" [...] and [...] "L2" [...] are larger.

With most European cartridges, the dimension [...] "S" [...] is always identical. On the other hand, many American cartridge designs exhibit an oversize designated as delta L (ΔL). This leads to the situation that a cartridge manufactured at the upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> can not be loaded into a chamber that was manufactured at the lower <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit.</b> Because cartridges are often manufactured in the lower dimensional <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> and chambers tend to be manufactured in the higher dimensional <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits,</b> these problems are often avoided with (semi) automatic and repeating arms.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundRadiotherapy {{simulators}} play {{an important}} role in the preparation of radiation treatment. Their mechanical and geometrical parameters have to be identical with those of the treatment machines. Therefore, quality control protocols for the simulators should be comprehensive and the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> as high as those for treatment machines. AimEvaluation of the technical status of radiotherapy simulators involved in clinical trials. Materials/MethodsIn this paper, results of quality control tests conducted in 12 Polish radiotherapy centres are presented. The tests were carried out within the framework of Polish research project KBN No. 6 P 05 C 032 20. 12 radiotherapy simulators installed in Polish radiotherapy centres were thoroughly tested. In order to control technical conditions of the simulators, a set of 24 tests was elaborated. The tests were divided into six thematic groups. The detailed range of the parameters controlled and the accepted ranges of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are given. The values of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are based on data found in the available literature. ResultsThe control of 12 simulators revealed the violation of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for 13 out of 24 controlled parameters. The most frequent violations of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> occurred in the case of geometrical parameters of light simulation and mechanical parameters of the couch, both very important for the accuracy of the simulation process. For 2 simulators almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> ConclusionsThe control of radiotherapy simulators undertaken within the framework of the clinical trial revealed that in the majority of cases the simulators were in good technical condition. In 2 cases almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> In such cases the manufacturers' service should be called urgently for necessary repairs and regulations. After repeated quality control tests a decision should be taken regarding the accepted range of operations which could be used in clinical practice. A QA and QC system for radiotherapy simulators should be introduced in each radiotherapy centre...|$|R
