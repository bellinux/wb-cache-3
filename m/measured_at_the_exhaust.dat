40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the combustion process in an industrial radiant tube burner (RTB), used in heat treating furnaces, as part of an attempt to improve burner performance. A detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics model has been used, validated with experimental test furnace temperature and flue gas composition measurements. Simulations using the Eddy Dissipation combustion model with peak temperature limitation and the Discrete Transfer radiation model showed good agreement with temperature measurements in the inner and outer walls of the burner, as well as with flue gas composition <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> (including NO). Other combustion and radiation models were also tested but gave inferior results in various aspects. The effects of certain RIB design features are analysed, and an analysis of the heat transfer processes within the burner is presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a wavelet {{neural network}} (WNN) model of {{internal}} combustion engine emissions is presented. We collect data of a 1. 6 L spark ignition gasoline engine. The engine was coupled to a hydraulic dynamometer to control the engine speed in real time. Setting four parameters specifies the set point, so the engine speed, the injection time, the injected fuel mass flow and {{the angle of the}} admission throttle valve are the input variables to the engine model. The output parameters that were <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> tile pipe are hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Performances of the different predictor models were evaluated using standard statistical evaluation criteria. The results showed that the use of wavelets neural networks can describe the emission behavior of the studied gasoline engine. High correlation values R 2 of 0. 9714, 0. 9626 and 0. 9929 were observed between the measured and predicted HC, CO and NOx exhaust emissions respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} {{activity was}} to evaluate the influence of ethanol fuel on the pollutant emissions <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of a conventional and a hybrid scooter. Both scooters are 4 -stroke, 125 cm 3 of engine capacity and Euro 3 compliant. They were tested on chassis dynamometer for measuring gaseous emissions of CO, HC, NOx, CO 2 and some toxic micro organic pollutants, such as benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The fuel consumption was estimated throughout a carbon balance on the exhaust species. Moreover, total particles number with diameter between 20 nm up to 1 μm was measured. Worldwide and European test cycles were carried out with both scooters fuelled with gasoline and ethanol/gasoline blends (10 / 90, 20 / 80 and 30 / 70 % vol). According to the experimental results relative to both scooter technologies, the addiction of ethanol in gasoline reduces CO and particles number emissions. The combustion of conventional scooter becomes unstable when a percentage of 30 %v of bioethanol is fed; as consequence a strong increasing of hydrocarbon is monitored, including carcinogenic species. The negative effects of ethanol fuel {{are related to the}} increasing of fuel consumption due to the less carbon content for volume unit and to the increasing of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde due to the higher oxygen availability. Almost 70 % of Ozone Formation Potential is covered by alkenes and aromatics...|$|E
40|$|Although mass {{emissions}} of combustion-generated particulate matter have been substantially reduced by new combustion technology, {{there is still}} a great concern about the emissions of huge numbers of sub- 10  nm particles with insignificant mass. These particles have up to orders of magnitude higher surface area to mass ratios compared to larger particles, have surfaces covered with adsorbed volatile and semi-volatile organic species or even are constituted by such species. Currently there is only very little information available on exposure and related health effects specific for smaller particles and first evidences for long-term health effects has only been recently published. However, the fact that these nanoparticles are not easily <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhausts</b> and in <b>the</b> atmosphere and that their biological activity is obscure {{does not mean that we}} can overlook them.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this work was to analyse the spatial variation of traffic air pollution, especially focussing on ultrafine particles (particles smaller than 100 nm, UFPs). Measuring any potential effect of any traffic air pollutant crucially requires, indeed, a comprehensive understanding of its spatiotemporal variations and distribution. To this respect, UFPs clearly emitted by internal combustion engines are extremely variable in both space and time, and this variability {{is believed to be}} an important issue to assess traffic air pollution fate and exposure. The process from emission <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tailpipe to concentration in ambient air was analysed using a two stage structure, namely, ‘tailpipe-to-road’ and ‘road-to-ambient’. The analysis was applied firstly for major traffic air pollutants, and then to UFPs. The methodology was developed by considering air pollutants’ concentration in terms of frequency distributions (FD) of the related space series. The dilution process (indicated by a LogNormal FD) was shown to be not the dominant process to fit the spatial variations of traffic air pollutants, which were conversely found to be well-fitted by the Gaussian FD. This revealed that when traffic emissions in an urban area can be considered as sources spatially diffused (no highways, etc.), the diffusion process in the atmosphere (represented by the Gaussian FD) dominates the distribution in space of such pollutants. This level of analysis has enhanced a deeper comprehension of the problem revealing governing factors and principal components of traffic air pollution variations in both space and time, and <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> stages. There appear at least two directions to proceed from the present study. First, the pursuing towards a stage 0 for the analysis of UFPs engine-to-tailpipe. Then, the assessment of UFP spatial distribution from engine-to-tailpipe-to-road-to-ambient. This could close the circle suggested by this Ph.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in gas turbine combustor design {{are aimed at}} achieving low exhaust emissions, hence modern aircraft jet engines are designed with lean-burn combustion systems. In the present work, we report an experimental study on lean combustion in a liquid fuel burner, operated under a non-premixed (single point injection) regime that mimics the combustion in a modern aircraft engine. The flame behavior was investigated in proximity of the blow-out limit by an intensified high rate Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera equipped with different optical filters to selectively record single species chemiluminescence emissions (e. g., OH*, CH*). Analogous filters were also used in combination with photomultiplier (PMT) tubes. Furthermore this work investigates well-mixed lean low NOx combustion where mixing is good and generation of solid carbon particulate emissions should be very low. An analysis of pollutants such as fine particles and gaseous emissions was also performed. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of the combustion chamber by two different particle size measuring instruments: a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI). NOx concentration measurements were performed by using a cross-flow modulation chemiluminescence detection system; CO concentration emissions were acquired with a Cross-flow modulation Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption method. All the measurements were completed by diagnostics of the fundamental combustor parameters. The results herein presented show that at very-lean conditions the emissions of both particulate matter and CO was found to increase most likely due to the occurrence of flame instabilities while the NOx were observed to reduce...|$|E
30|$|In a port-fuel-injected engine, {{the fuel}} is {{generally}} injected at {{the backside of}} a closed intake valve {{to take advantage of}} the warm valve and port surfaces for vaporization [22, 23, 24]. However, a large part of the injected spray is deposited on the intake manifold surfaces and forms a layer of liquid film on the valve and port surfaces. The film needs to be re-atomized by the shearing airflow as the intake valves open. If these fuel layers are not well atomized, they enter the cylinder as drops and ligaments [25, 26, 27]. These phenomena occur in varying degrees and depend upon the engine design, injector location and engine operation. Previous experiments on the same engine fuelled by gasoline and BU 20 demonstrated that the injector sprayed the fuel towards the plate between the intake valves and on the intake valves stems [28, 29, 30]. The droplet impingement induced fuel layer formation on the intake manifold walls. The fuel layers were drawn by gravity to the valve head and gap, where they remained as film due to surface tension. The stripping of the squeezed fuel film created fuel deposits on the optical window. When the injection occurred in open-valve condition, part of the droplets was carried directly into the combustion chamber by the gas flow. These droplets, sucked in the combustion chamber, stuck on the cylinder walls. In both injection conditions, the fuel deposits on the combustion chamber walls created fuel-rich zones on the piston surfaces that influenced the composition of the mixture charge and, hence, the combustion process. During the normal combustion process, only a fraction of the fuel deposits was completely burned. Thus, more fuel should be injected to reach the selected air-fuel ratio <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> [23].|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{in small}} scale devices poses {{significant}} challenges {{due to the}} quenching of reactions from wall heat losses {{as well as the}} significantly reduced time available for mixing and combustion. In the case of liquid fuels there are additional challenges related to atomization, vaporization and mixing with the oxidant in the very short time-scale liquid-fuel combustor. The liquid fuel employed here is methanol with air as the oxidizer. The combustor was designed based on the heat recirculating concept wherein the incoming reactants are preheated by the combustion products through heat exchange occurring via combustor walls. The combustor was fabricated from Zirconium phosphate, a ceramic with very low thermal conductivity (0. 8 Â WÂ m- 1 Â K- 1). The combustor had rectangular shaped double spiral geometry with combustion chamber {{in the center of the}} spiral formed by inlet and exhaust channels. Methanol and air were introduced immediately upstream at inlet of the combustor. The preheated walls of the inlet channel also act as a pre-vaporizer for liquid fuel which vaporizes the liquid fuel and then mixes with air prior to the fuel-air mixture reaching the combustion chamber. Rapid pre-vaporization of the liquid fuel by the hot narrow channel walls eliminated the necessity for a fuel atomizer. Self-sustained combustion of methanol-air was achieved in a chamber volume as small as 32. 6 Â mm 3. The results showed stable combustion under fuel-rich conditions. High reactant preheat temperatures (675 Â K- 825 Â K) were obtained; however, the product temperatures <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> were on the lower side (475 Â K- 615 Â K). The estimated combustor heat load was in the range 50 Â W- 280 Â W and maximum power density of about 8. 5 Â GW/m 3. This is very high when compared to macro-scale combustors. Overall energy efficiency of the combustor was estimated to be in the range of 12 - 20 %. This suggests further scope of improvements in fuel-air mixing and mixture preparation.

The noise levels were measured following standard procedure by using calibrated sound pressure level meter at {{all sides of the}} car front, rear, right and left sides. This investigation has been conducted to measure the noise pollution level from Toyota car Model 2002 because it used for most Saudi people. Measurements of the noise level from this car at stationary and motion situation have been carried out. The noise levels produced by variable engine speed ranged from 750 to 4000 rpm were recorded. The sound level found to be 59. 45 dBA when the vehicle in motion at normal speed.

30|$|The {{effect on}} the {{spark-ignition}} combustion process of n-butanol blended in volume with pure gasoline was investigated through cycle-resolved visualization applied in a single-cylinder PFI SI engine working at low speed, medium boosting and wide-open throttle. Two injection timings were fixed in order to inject the fuel at closed intake valve and open intake valve, respectively. The spark timing was changed to identify the maximum brake torque and the knocking limit. Blends of butanol up to 40 % allowed working in more advanced spark timing without negative effects on performance. To work with a stoichiometric mixture for both fuels, the duration of injection was slightly increased for the blend. DOI in CV resulted longer than in OV for both fuels because, in CV injection, part of the injected spray is deposited on the intake manifold surfaces, forming a layer of liquid film. If these fuel layers are not well atomized, they enter the cylinder as drops and ligaments. During the normal combustion process, {{only part of the}} fuel deposits was completely burned. Thus, more fuel should be injected to reach the selected air-fuel ratio <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> When the normal flame front reached the fuel deposits, abnormal combustion was incepted. This was characterized by intense diffusion-controlled flames. Their contribution to the combustion pressure was negligible. The different levels of intensity were related to different carbonaceous structures and soot precursor concentrations. CV condition was characterized by higher fuel deposition amount and thus more intense diffusion-controlled flames than OV. Gasoline in CV condition showed the highest luminosity, and BU 40 in OV condition, the lowest one. This demonstrated that BU 40 _OV allowed the reduction of emission of ultrafine carbonaceous particles at the exhaust and the optimization of fuel consumption at fixed performance. Moreover, medium-low percentage of butanol in the gasoline allowed the reduction of NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emission. Finally, even if an increase in the injected fuel amount should be considered to obtain the same air-fuel ratio for butanol-gasoline blend, if compared to pure gasoline, the better efficiency of fuel deposit burning allowed the reduction of that amount.|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{generated}} {{particulate matter}} is widely recognized {{to be the}} major pollutant in urban areas because of stationary combustor and vehicular traffic sources. Particularly the ultrafine fraction was proven to have the highest impact on human health since its ability to deeply penetrate the lung and the circulatory system and to be enriched in toxic condensable species {{because of the large}} specific surface area. Up to recent times the nanometric fraction, i. e. below 10 nm, was not taken in consideration, despite it is the most toxic, because it was assumed that such small particles meet and coagulate at gas kinetic rate so that their lifetime was negligible small. Some recent results on carbonaceous nanometric particles generated in laboratory flames showed that, at high temperatures, their coagulation as well their collection efficiencies drops dramatically orders of magnitude as their size decreases below 5 nm. Consequently they could escape from combustors and filters and survive in the atmosphere in a not negligible amount. Ashes and additives present in practical fuels, biomass and wastes contain a not negligible amount of metals which brought at high temperature, cause the emission of ultrafine particles. The fraction with size smaller than 10 nm of such inorganic particles was not yet studied neither <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of combustors despite {{it is well known that}} the addition of trace amount of metals to a flame causes the formation of nanoparticles. The aim of the research activity described in this thesis is to characterize such small toxic metal nanoparticles and to verify if they could be released at the exhaust of combustion systems because their coagulation and collection efficiency, at high temperature, follow the same trend of carbonaceous nanoparticles. The thesis is composed of three main part roughly corresponding to the three year of the research activity. The first two chapters contains the background information on combustion generated particles and aerosol dynamic. The chapters two and three describe the followed experimental methodologies while the third parts contain the results and the relative discussions.

40|$|The use of {{alternative}} fuels for aviation {{is likely to}} increase due to concerns over fuel security, price stability and the sustainability of fuel sources. Concurrent reductions in particulate emissions from these alternative fuels are expected because of changes in fuel composition including reduced sulfur and aromatic content. The NASA Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) was conducted in January–February 2009 to investigate the effects of synthetic fuels on gas-phase and particulate emissions. Standard petroleum JP- 8 fuel, pure synthetic fuels produced from natural gas and coal feedstocks using the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process, and 50 % blends of both fuels were tested in the CFM- 56 engines on a DC- 8 aircraft. To examine plume chemistry and particle evolution with time, samples were drawn from inlet probes positioned 1, 30, and 145 m downstream of the aircraft engines. No significant alteration to engine performance was measured when burning the alternative fuels. However, leaks in the aircraft fuel system were detected when operated with the pure FT fuels {{as a result of the}} absence of aromatic compounds in the fuel. Dramatic reductions in soot emissions were measured for both the pure FT fuels (reductions of 84 % averaged over all powers) and blended fuels (64 %) relative to the JP- 8 baseline with the largest reductions at idle conditions. The alternative fuels also produced smaller soot (e. g. at 85 % power, volume mean diameters were reduced from 78 nm for JP- 8 to 51 nm for the FT fuel), which may reduce their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The reductions in particulate emissions are expected for all alternative fuels with similar reductions in fuel sulfur and aromatic content regardless of the feedstock. As the plume cools downwind of the engine, nucleation-mode aerosols form. For the pure FT fuels, reductions (94 % averaged over all powers) in downwind particle number emissions were similar to those <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> plane (84 %). However, the blended fuels had less of a reduction (reductions of 30 – 44 %) than initially measured (64 %). The likely explanation is that the reduced soot emissions in the blended fuel exhaust plume results in promotion of new particle formation microphysics, rather than coating on pre-existing soot particles, which is dominant in the JP- 8 exhaust plume. Downwind particle volume emissions were reduced for both the pure (79 and 86 % reductions) and blended FT fuels (36 and 46 %) due to the large reductions in soot emissions. In addition, the alternative fuels had reduced particulate sulfate production (near-zero for FT fuels) due to decreased fuel sulfur content. To study the formation of volatile aerosols (defined as any aerosol formed as the plume ages) in more detail, tests were performed at varying ambient temperatures (− 4 to 20 °C). At idle, particle number and volume emissions were reduced linearly with increasing ambient temperature, with best fit slopes corresponding to − 1. 2 × 10 6 # (kg fuel) − 1 °C − 1 for particle number emissions and − 9. 7 mm 3 (kg fuel) − 1 °C − 1 for particle volume emissions. The temperature dependence of aerosol formation can have large effects on local air quality surrounding airports in cold regions. Aircraft produced aerosols in these regions will be much larger than levels expected based solely on measurements made directly at the engine exit plane. The majority (90 % at idle) of the volatile aerosol mass formed as nucleation-mode aerosols with a smaller fraction as a soot coating. Conversion efficiencies of up to 3. 8 % were measured for the partitioning of gas-phase precursors (unburned hydrocarbons and SO 2) to form volatile aerosols. Highest conversion efficiencies were measured at 45 % power...|$|E
40|$|The diesel engine, {{because of}} its {{superior}} fuel economy compared with spark ignition engines, has attracted considerable attention. Significant improvement in their performance and engine emissions has been achieved. The use of various advanced internal measures has resulted in significant reduction of pollutant emissions inside the combustion chamber. Nevertheless, considering the increasingly restrictive 'engine-out' emission standards to be adopted, {{it appears that the}} use of air throttling systems is possibly inevitable {{in order to meet the}} future limits. This is because NOx and soot emissions are usually affected in the opposite way from the various internal measures. However, the use of conventional air throttling systems in DI diesel engines is not possible owing to the lean nature of diesel combustion, which does not permit the use of catalysts for controlling NOx emissions. Currently, alternative solutions are proposed focusing on the use of a selective catalytic reduction system, requiring a carefully controlled injection of urea or NOx traps (adsorbers) When the storage capacity of the trap is reached, during normal lean operation, the engine must switch to rich operation in order to produce the necessary reducing agents, that is, CO and H 2, which release the stored NO, to react with CO in a catalyst to finally form N,. In this work, an extended computational investigation has been conducted to examine various strategies for achieving rich combustion in diesel engines. Rich diesel combustion has recently attracted attention for the regeneration of NOx traps. Rich combustion can be achieved using either internal or external <b>measures,</b> (fuel injection <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold). Rich operation is expected to have a negative impact on engine performance and emissions resulting in an increase of brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), soot and exhaust gas temperature. For this reason, in this work, various strategies are examined for achieving rich combustion using internal measures, namely intake air throttling or/and waste gate operation, EGR and late post injection. The investigation was conducted on a heavy-duty DI diesel engine, using a phenomenological simulation code that is based on a multizone combustion model. Information is provided concerning the impact of the various rich strategies examined on engine performance and emissions. This enables us to estimate the most appropriate one. Using this information, we established a combination of strategies to achieve the lowest possible A value with acceptable overall fuel and soot penalties.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an experimentally validated modelling {{study of the}} flow of combustion air in an industrial radiant tube burner (RTB). The RTB is used typically in industrial heat treating furnaces. The work has been initiated because of the need for improvements in burner lifetime and performance which are related to the fluid mechanics of the com busting flow, and a fundamental understanding of this is therefore necessary. To achieve this, a detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been used, validated with experimental air flow, temperature and flue gas measurements. Initially, the work programme is presented and the theory behind RTB design and operation in addition to the theory behind swirling flows and methane combustion. NOx reduction techniques are discussed and numerical modelling of combusting flows is detailed in this section. The importance of turbulence, radiation and combustion modelling is highlighted, as well as the numerical schemes that incorporate discretization, finite volume theory and convergence. The study first focuses on the combustion air flow and its delivery to the combustion zone. An isothermal computational model was developed to allow the examination of the flow characteristics as it enters the burner and progresses through the various sections prior to the discharge face in the combustion area. Important features identified include the air recuperator swirler coil, the step ring, the primary/secondary air splitting flame tube and the fuel nozzle. It was revealed that the effectiveness of the air recuperator swirler is significantly compromised by the need for a generous assembly tolerance. Also, there is a substantial circumferential flow maldistribution introduced by the swirier, but that this is effectively removed by the positioning of a ring constriction in the downstream passage. Computations using the k-ε turbulence model show good agreement with experimentally measured velocity profiles in the combustion zone and proved the use of the modelling strategy prior to the combustion study. Reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 200, 000 nodes. Agreement was poorer with the RNG  k-ε and Reynolds Stress models. The study continues to address the combustion process itself and the heat transfer process internal to the RTB. A series of combustion and radiation model configurations were developed and the optimum combination of the Eddy Dissipation (ED) combustion model and the Discrete Transfer (DT) radiation model was used successfully to validate a burner experimental test. The previously cold flow validated k-ε turbulence model was used and reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 300, 000 nodes. The combination showed good agreement with temperature measurements in the inner and outer walls of the burner, as well as with flue gas composition <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> The inner tube wall temperature predictions validated the experimental measurements in the largest portion of the thermocouple locations, highlighting a small flame bias to one side, although the model slightly over predicts the temperatures towards the downstream end of the inner tube. NOx emissions were initially over predicted, however, the use of a combustion flame temperature limiting subroutine allowed convergence to the experimental value of 451 ppmv. With the validated model, the effectiveness of certain RTB features identified previously is analysed, and an analysis of the energy transfers throughout the burner is presented, to identify the dominant mechanisms in each region. The optimum turbulence-combustion-radiation model selection was then the baseline for further model development. One of these models, an eccentrically positioned flame tube model highlights the failure mode of the RTB during long term operation. Other models were developed to address NOx reduction and improvement of the flame profile in the burner combustion zone. These included a modified fuel nozzle design, with 12 circular section fuel ports, which demonstrates a longer and more symmetric flame, although with limited success in NOx reduction. In addition, a zero bypass swirler coil model was developed that highlights the effect of the stronger swirling combustion flow. A reduced diameter and a 20 mm forward displaced flame tube model shows limited success in NOx reduction; although the latter demonstrated improvements in the discharge face heat distribution and improvements in the flame symmetry. Finally, Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) modelling attempts indicate the difficulty of the application of this NOx reduction technique in the Wellman RTB. Recommendations for further work are made that include design mitigations for the fuel nozzle and further burner modelling is suggested to improve computational validation. The introduction of fuel staging is proposed, as well as a modification in the inner tube to enhance the effect of FGR...|$|E

Methods: Two categories of ventilators were tested: (1) Ventilators without Proprietary Filters: Servo-i (Maquet) and Galileo (Hamilton) and (2) Ventilator with proprietary filters: PB 840 (Covidien). Each ventilator was attached to a simple test lung and operated with VT 500 ml, RR 20 bpm, PIF 50 L/min, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O. Four separate doses of albuterol (2. 5 mg/ 3 mL) were administered via jet nebuliser (eValueMed, Tri-anim) placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> “Y”. In Experiment A, a filter (Respirgard 303) was placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port. In Experiment B, two filters were attached to the ventilators without proprietary filters: (1) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of expiratory limb and (2) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> outlet. Drug was eluted from filters and measured using spectrophotometry. Results: Drug deposited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port without expiratory filtering was 3 ̆e 160 fold higher than with expiratory filtering. The collecting filter {{used in this study}} was less efficient than the proprietary filter designed for use with the ventilator. Regardless of type of filter used, placement of filter in the expiratory limb reduced secondhand aerosol exposure significantly. Conclusion: Risk of secondhand exposure to exhaled aerosol can account for 3 ̆e 45...|$|R

40|$|To meet current Diesel engine {{pollutant}} legislation, it {{is important}} to manage after-treatment devices. The paper describes the development of Neural Network based virtual sensors used to estimate NOx emissions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of automotive Diesel engines. Suitable identification methodologies and experimental tests were developed with the aim of meeting the conflicting needs of feasible on-board implementation and satisfactory prediction accuracy. In addition, since the prediction of control-oriented models is typically affected by engine aging and production spread as well as components drift, least square technique features were exploited in order to overcome these issues by adapting the virtual sensor output. The NOx adaptive virtual sensor was tested via comparison with experimental data, <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> engine test bench on a turbocharged common-rail automotive Diesel engine. Furthermore, besides model validation, the experimental measurements were modified to simulate a sensor drift in order to enable full assessment of the proposed LS-based algorithm adaptation capabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of the research in animal buildings has been on measured concentrations of contaminants that the workers and animals are exposed to; emission measurements have only gained attention in recent years due to potential federal regulations on air quality emissions from animal feeding operations (AFOs). The contribution of AFOs to ambient PM 10 and PM 2. 5 entails reliable measurement of particle size distribution. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure and compare the size distribution of particulate matter (PM) at multiple locations inside and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhausts</b> of a wean‐to‐finish commercial swine building. The particle size distribution was measured by collecting total suspended particulate matter on Teflon filters and using Coulter Counter and Horiba LA‐ 300 analyzers for particle size distribution analyses. Results showed that the mass median diameter (MMD) of swine PM <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> was about 14 % lower than the average MMD indoors (26. 84 vs. 31. 55 m), while the geometric standard deviations were about the same (1. 85 vs. 1. 86). In addition, the average percentage by volume of PM 10 indoors was about 8 %, while the percentage of PM 10 leaving the building was 10 %. In terms of the mass concentrations, PM 10 indoors ranged from 0. 014 to 0. 125 mg m‐ 3, while <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> PM 10 ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 15 mg m‐ 3.
