5|$|Activity {{gradually}} declined {{over the}} next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> involved.|$|E
5|$|After the cadence, the <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{punctuated by}} a second {{rendition}} of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat. This leads into the second fugato episode in the key of C minor.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. In retrospect, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing culture war.|$|R

50|$|Overt {{orienting}} is {{the act of}} selectively {{attending to}} an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction. Overt orienting can be directly observed {{in the form of}} eye movements. Although overt eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by the superior colliculus of the midbrain. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by areas in the frontal lobe. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> slow and voluntary.|$|R
5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using {{the first and the}} two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a chorale fantasia dominated by the trumpet. In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas is different from the one used in movements 1 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of <b>movement)</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the <b>movement</b> <b>is,</b> in his view, too fast.|$|E

5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio.

5|$|The first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in 3/4 time, {{hitherto}} uncommon among Haydn's opening movements.
