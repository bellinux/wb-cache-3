5000|$|However, {{regardless}} of whether unlawful tax evasion was being engaged in, the incident has fuelled the perception among European governments and the press that tax havens provide facilities shrouded in secrecy designed to facilitate unlawful tax evasion, rather than legitimate tax planning and legal tax mitigation schemes. This in turn {{has led to a}} call for [...] "crackdowns" [...] on tax havens. Whether the calls for such a crackdown are mere posturing or lead to more definitive activity by <b>mainstream</b> <b>economies</b> to restrict access to tax havens is yet to be seen. No definitive announcements or proposals have yet been made by the European Union or governments of the member states.|$|R

The subtext of much of her work is the separation of individuals from the rest of society, often in cycles of poverty. Early motherhood, hunger, and alienation from <b>mainstream</b> <b>economies</b> are manifest in stories such as Ghostless and Tall Grass. The sharply divided interests of urban and rural Americans and the powerful determinant of social class is manifest in Bait and [...] "Redneck Boys" [...] where the death toll of rural highways is both the cause of nonchalance and horror.|$|R

50|$|The precise {{definition}} of what constitutes an economy car has varied with time and place, based on the conditions prevailing at the time, such as fuel prices, disposable income of buyers, and cultural mores. In any given decade, there has generally been some rough global consensus on what constituted the minimum necessary requirements for a highway-worthy car, constituting the most economical car possible. However, whether that consensus could be a commercial success in any given country depended on local culture. Thus in any given decade, every country has had a rough national consensus on what constituted the minimum necessary requirements for the least expensive car that wasn't undesirable, that is, that had some commercially attractive amount of market demand, making it a <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy</b> car. In many countries at various times, <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy</b> and maximum economy have been one and the same.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} social {{enterprise}} is increasingly gaining academic interest worldwide and {{is becoming an}} integral component of the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economies</b> of many countries, including the United Kingdom. Despite persistent interest from academics, the concept is a relatively underdeveloped and inherently complex. There are various aspects of social enterprise that remain under researched compared to conventional businesses. Given the advent of globalisation and increased competition,social enterprises are under pressure to provide more innovative solutions to social problems that society in the UK face. Through a comprehensive literature review of social enterprises, this paper scrutinises the evolution of these organisations as they adapt {{to changes in the}} environment in which they operates. The discussions show a cultural shift in the conceptualisation and practice of social enterprises in the country...|$|R

30|$|As {{a prelude}} to above analysis, let us first take a quick review of {{evolution}} {{of the idea of}} economies of scale since 1770 s and the intermittent debates on economies of scope in the 1950 s and 1970 s and subsequent <b>mainstreaming</b> of <b>economies</b> of scale and industrial organizational designs as engines of growth leading to a gradual death of the idea of economies of scope.|$|R
50|$|Community and {{monetary}} economist Thomas H. Greco, Jr. {{has argued that}} the <b>mainstream</b> global <b>economy</b> with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce.

40|$|Payments for {{environmental}} services (PES) are increasingly promoted {{as an economic}} mechanism that could potentially address socio-economic and environmental conservation objectives in developing regions. However, the reporting and conditionality requirements of PES projects can be inhibitory, particularly for people with low environmental monitoring or administration capacity. Here, I provide five case studies where Indigenous Land and Sea Management groups in remote northern Australia, have combined Indigenous ecological knowledge, Western science, and the innovative CyberTracker technology to record and monitor the ecological outcomes of their land management activities to facilitate engagement with <b>mainstream</b> <b>economies</b> in Australia. The case studies elucidate methods of data collection and recording for established and potential PES projects where environmental monitoring and adaptive land and sea management are clear objectives, with longer term prospects for socio-economic benefits of Indigenous community education, empowerment and development. Similar monitoring and reporting methods could be applied in other contexts where individuals or community groups want to engage in emerging mainstream environmental service markets, but lack environmental monitoring and reporting capacity, such as other Indigenous groups, people from economically poor regions, or farmers in environmentally valuable regions. 11 page(s...|$|R
50|$|New {{economic}} models, {{exemplified by}} incremental microdonations and crowd-funding strategies like Sponsume and Kickstarter, offer new modes of project initiation and development, destabilising the traditionally feudal hierarchy of client/architect/occupant. Financing of private projects increasingly {{moves to the}} public domain, offering mass rather than singular ownership, whereas funding of public projects {{can be derived from}} more flexible, responsive frameworks than simple levies or taxation. Open-source architecture should have particular appeal for builders entirely outside the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy,</b> such as squatters, refugees and the military.|$|E
50|$|Yet {{others believe}} {{that a number of}} basic {{building}} blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place. For instance, some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues, otherwise {{only a small part of}} the economic sector will be able to participate in growth. That is, without inclusive property rights in the equation, the informal sector will remain outside the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy,</b> excluded and without the same opportunities for study.|$|E
50|$|Offshore {{private banking}} is usually more {{accessible}} to those on higher incomes, because {{of the costs of}} establishing and maintaining offshore accounts. However, simple savings accounts can be opened by anyone and maintained with scale fees equivalent to their onshore counterparts. The tax burden in developed countries thus falls disproportionately on middle-income groups. Historically, tax cuts have tended to result in a higher proportion of the tax take being paid by high-income groups, as previously sheltered income is brought back into the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy.</b> The Laffer curve demonstrates this tendency.|$|E

Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like Peter MacDonald, a Navajo, left their jobs in the <b>mainstream</b> U.S. <b>economy</b> to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.|$|R

Four-fifths of the self-employed are drawn from the population of recent migrants from Zhejiang; rates of entrepreneurship in the other groups are much lower. Chinese migrants from Mozambique and the other ex-Portuguese colonies, due to their fluency in Portuguese and familiarity with local business practices, are able to enter the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy</b> and find professional employment, especially as bank employees, engineers, and doctors.|$|E

Not all of their attempts to leave were successful. Some had things that kept hold on them in the drug world and hurt their success in legitimate ventures. Their exits from the drug world then tended to be temporary and easily broken; periods of relapse into dealing occurred. This tended to be a cycle every time an attempt to exit was made; however, each subsequent attempt brought them further back into society. Their reattachment to society had its own set of problems due to their long absence from the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two {{important}} aspects {{to the emergence}} of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was laissez-faire based capitalism, and the second mode was the model of a centrally-planned economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses social relations. Peer production is {{a significant part of the}} <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy,</b> even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.|$|E

The CCEDNet vision is to strengthen community economic development in urban, rural, northern and Aboriginal communities across Canada, and contribute to better social, economic and environmental conditions at the local level. CCEDNet's members are from community-based organizations, co-operatives, social enterprises, practitioners, active citizens, researchers, and other organizations from every region of Canada.

50|$|One {{possible}} goal of asset {{building is}} for residents, businesses, and institutions to become interconnected {{with each other}} and the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy.</b> Having assets such as those made possible by IDA accounts gives an individual more wealth as well as disposable income. The community benefits from the increased spending power among residents, which may attract new businesses or increase home ownership rates. IDAs can also {{play an important role in}} fostering social inclusion. In the past few decades, there has been growing concern about the level of marginalization currently experienced by vulnerable groups and about unequal distribution of wealth. The economic stability that assets purchased through IDAs provide enables the creation and maximization of opportunities for meaningful participation of socially vulnerable people like racial minorities and women in economic, social, and political institutions under conditions that enhance their well-being and capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} often remains a {{difficult}} challenge, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.. Because security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but {{there is a lack of}} trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the FATA. Because of the extensive hostility to any hint of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007. There have been calls to implement greater measures for integrating FATA into the <b>mainstream</b> <b>economy.</b> In this regard, there are several economic, industrial and social development reconstruction ventures that have been undertaken by the government recently in order to aid FATA's economy, including the launch of organisations such as the FATA Development Authority.|$|E
30|$|Subalterns {{constitute}} {{the large majority}} of the members of any social system and are closely associated with the geopolitics of any geographical area. Subalterns have often created alternative economies through their networks of solidarity to rally themselves against the hegemonic scourge of <b>mainstream</b> <b>economies.</b> A subaltern business group is identified in the present study, and the applicability of the characteristics of alternative economies is researched. The objective of the present study is to explore the overlapping space of subaltern business groups and alternative economy. The subaltern has often spoken through qualitative studies in the past. The present study embraces the following steps: (a) tracing the evolution of alternative economy with a view to understanding the characteristics of alternative economy; (b) identifying some distinctive characteristics of alternative economic networks; and (c) utilizing the distinctive characteristics of alternative economic networks, to conduct a qualitative study of an organization of subaltern street peddlers. The narratives collected from the subaltern peddlers are used to present certain inferences {{about the nature of the}} overlapping space of alternative economy and subaltern businesses. A conceptual framework is constructed for this overlapping space based upon the present study. Such a conceptual framework of the overlapping space of alternative economy and subalterns may add certain important aspects to the simultaneously burgeoning body of academic works on alternative economy as well as subaltern studies. Scholars and policymakers may be able to understand the alternative economic networks of subalterns better and may establish policies for the sustenance of such networks.|$|R
