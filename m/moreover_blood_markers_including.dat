30|$|A {{preliminary}} preclinical {{evaluation of}} [18 F]EFB {{was carried out}} {{with the intention of}} clarifying its in vivo biodistribution and P 2 X 7 binding and to explore its ability to penetrate the BBB. The use of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed rat model was decided to enable comparison between the tracer uptake under low and high P 2 X 7 expression levels. This is known to induce increased P 2 X 7 expression as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining of rat brains 24  h after an intraperitoneal 0.5  mg/kg LPS injection [28]. Additionally, LPS-injected rats display protracted microglial activation [37, 38] and raised levels of a range of <b>blood</b> inflammatory <b>markers,</b> <b>including</b> TNF-α, NF-κβ and IL- 1 β [39]. Moreover, brain cortex expression of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are upregulated within 4  h, suggesting that glial activation and neuronal inflammation quickly follow systemic inflammatory episodes [40, 41], often outlasting them [42]. These biochemical changes are concomitant with an exaggerated weight loss [43, 44], and this measure was employed in this work to demonstrate effectiveness of the LPS treatment. A full validation of the process linking LPS to P 2 X 7 upregulation is ongoing. The 0.5  mg/kg LPS dose was preferred to higher doses based on reports that below 3  mg/kg, the endotoxin does not cause BBB disruption [45].|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEmerging acute kidney injury biomarkers, {{including}} neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), have a {{high potential}} for predicting worsening renal function. Acute exacerbation of renal dysfunction has {{a great impact on}} the outcomes of cardiovascular patients in critical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate whether plasma NGAL can predict the mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after discharge from the cardiac care unit (CCU). MethodsPatients who were admitted to the CCU of the Tokyo University Hospital were prospectively enrolled (101 patients). <b>Blood</b> and urinary <b>markers,</b> <b>including</b> the <b>blood</b> NGAL, brain natriuretic peptide, creatinine, cystatin C, urinary albumin, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and L-type fatty acid-binding protein, were measured at CCU discharge. The primary outcome was MACEs until at least 6 months after CCU discharge. ResultsThirty-five patients experienced MACEs (35 %). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that the plasma NGAL, length of CCU stay, and existence of diabetes and heart failure were independent predicting factors for MACEs. Patients with the highest NGAL at discharge (> 75 th percentile) showed a significantly higher risk of MACEs than those with the lowest NGAL (< 25 th percentile) (log-rank test; hazard ratio, 5. 15; 95 % confidence interval 1. 84 – 18. 20; p< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} health-related waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) cut-points associating with FITNESSGRAM’s body mass index (BMI) criterion-referenced standards in low-income children. A secondary aim was to examine the classification agreement between the derived WHtR cut-points and various cardiometabolic <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> using current recommendations. Participants were 219 children from low-income schools (mean age = 10. 5 ± 0. 6 years). Waist circumference, height, weight, and cardiometabolic <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> were collected in a fasting state before school hours. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine WHtR cut-points that associated with a child meeting FITNESSGRAM’s age- and sex-specific criterion-referenced standards for BMI. The derived WHtR cut-point was 0. 50 (AUC = 0. 89, p< 0. 001; sensitivity = 0. 86, specificity = 0. 82, and accuracy = 84. 3 %). Classification agreement using the derived WHtR cut-point with various <b>blood</b> <b>marker</b> standards was statistically significant but considered weak to fair (kappa 0. 14 – 0. 34, agreement = 59 %– 67 %, and p< 0. 01). The WHtR cut-point of 0. 50 can be used with strong accuracy to distinguish low-income children who met FITNESSGRAM’s criterion-referenced standards for body composition; however, the evidence was weaker for its use in distinguishing low-income children meeting specific cardiometabolic <b>blood</b> <b>marker</b> recommendations...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To develop {{strategies}} based on simple clinical assessment and <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> to identify older individuals {{at high risk}} for Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A prospective study of non-diabetic men (n = 3523) and women (n = 3404) aged 60 - 79 years followed for 7 years, during which there were 297 incident cases of Type 2 diabetes. Logistic regression was used to develop scores to predict incident cases, starting with clinical predictors and adding <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> that predicted the incidence of diabetes. Receiving operating characteristic analyses were used to assess improvement in prediction. RESULTS: The area under the curve for a simple clinical assessment score, which included age, sex, family history of diabetes, smoking status, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension and recall of doctor diagnosis of coronary heart disease was 0. 765 (0. 740, 0. 791); sensitivity and specificity in the top quintile of the score were 50. 3 and 81. 4 %, respectively. Addition of simple fasting <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose improved prediction [area under the curve = 0. 817 (0. 793, 0. 840), P < 0. 0001; sensitivity 63. 8 %; specificity 82. 0 %]. An alternative model adding <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> not dependent on fasting yielded similar results. Further addition of C-reactive protein made no improvement. Blood measurements made small differences to reclassification of risk in those in the lowest three quintiles of the non-laboratory score. CONCLUSION: In large population settings, simple clinical assessments could be used in the first instance to identify older adults who would benefit from further testing with routine (non-fasting) <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> to identify those at most likely to be at elevated diabetes risk...|$|R

I set out to determine whether <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> can be applied to: (i) improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of stroke or TIA, and/or (ii) improve the prediction of poor outcome in patients who are still symptomatic at the time of admission with stroke or TIA. I systematically reviewed the existing literature on the diagnostic performance of a range of <b>blood</b> <b>markers</b> measured soon after stroke onset, to inform the choice of markers for my subsequent prospective studies in this thesis.

40|$|Disease {{progression}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is variable, with some patients having a relatively stable course, while others suffer relentless progression leading to severe breathlessness, frequent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), respiratory failure and death. Radiological markers such as CT emphysema index, bronchiectasis and coronary artery calcification (CAC) {{have been linked}} with increased mortality in COPD patients. Molecular changes in lung tissue reflect alterations in lung pathology that occur with disease progression; however, lung tissue is not routinely accessible. Cell counts (including neutrophils) and mediators in induced sputum have been associated with lung function and risk of exacerbations. Examples of peripheral <b>blood</b> biological <b>markers</b> (biomarkers) <b>include</b> those associated with lung function (reduced CC- 16), emphysema severity (increased adiponectin, reduced sRAGE), exacerbations and mortality [increased CRP, fibrinogen, leukocyte count, IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) ] including increased YKL- 40 with mortality. Emerging approaches to discovering markers of gene-environment interaction include exhaled breath analysis [volatile organic compounds (VOCs), exhaled breath condensate], cellular and systemic responses to exposure to air pollution, alterations in the lung microbiome, and biomarkers of lung ageing such as telomere length shortening and reduced levels of sirtuins.

40|$|Chronic or {{recurrent}} gastrointestinal {{symptoms are}} common presentations among children in primary care. Because symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders may be indistinguishable from {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), it is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians to differentiate between them accurately. Unnecessary referrals in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders need to be balanced against the risk of missing a child with IBD. Calprotectin is an inflammatory marker that {{can be measured in}} faeces by using a simple non-invasive test, but has never been evaluated in children presenting in primary care. The main objective of the thesis was to determine the diagnostic value of faecal calprotectin for IBD in children presenting with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in primary care. The results showed that faecal calprotectin is a useful test for ruling out IBD in children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and alarm symptoms. <b>Blood</b> <b>markers</b> showed lower discriminative value than faecal calprotectin. The <b>blood</b> <b>marker</b> C-reactive protein had no added value to alarm symptoms in contrast to faecal calprotectin.
