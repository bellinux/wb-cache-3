40|$|The {{reactions}} of dimethyl <b>mucate,</b> mucic acid mono-lactone, and 2, 5 diacetyl disaccharolactone with diamines was investigated {{as a means}} of producing intermediates for the production of polymers corresponding to nylon. Di ethylene mucyl diamide was prepared from dimethyl <b>mucate</b> and ethylene diamine and its structure proven by the analysis of its dihydrochloride. The following compounds were prepared by reacting mucic acid mono-lactone with diamines: (1). Mono ethylene diamine mucyl diamide monohydrate. (2). Mono benzidine mucyl monamide. (3). Mono piperazine mucyl monomide. (4). Mono p-phenylene diamine dimucyl monomide. Compounds (3) and (4) were not obtained pure enough for carbon-hydrogen analysis. Compound (1) unlike the others was a cyclic monomer. The reaction between 2, 5 diacetyl disaccharolactone and ethylene diamine was attempted. A syrup was obtained which would not crystallize and was never characterized. The possibility of using these compounds as intermediates in the production of polymers has not been investigated sufficiently to justify any positive statements. Advisor: W. E. Militze...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{economical}} approaches for removal of toxic compounds is bioremediation. In the long term, bioremediation is economic and feasible compared to other methods, such as physical or chemical methods. A bacterium that can efficiently reduce molybdenum blue was isolated from polluted soil. Biochemical analysis revealed {{the identity of the}} bacterium as Enterobacter sp. strain Saw- 1. The growth parameters for optimal reduction of molybdenum to Mo-blue or molybdenum blue, a less toxic product, were determined around pH 6. 0 to 6. 5 and in the range of 30 to 37 ℃, respectively. Glucose was selected as preferred carbon source, followed by sucrose, maltose, l-rhamnose, cellobiose, melibiose, raffinose, d-mannose, lactose, glycerol, d-adonitol, d-mannitol, l-arabinose and <b>mucate.</b> Phosphate and molybdate were critically required at 5. 0 mM and 10 mM, respectively. The scanning absorption spectrum acquired to detect the development of complex Mo-blue showed similarity to previously isolated Mo-reducing bacteria. In addition, the spectrum closely resembled the molybdenum blue from the phosphate determination method. Heavy metals, including mercury, copper (II) and silver (I), inhibited reduction. Moreover, the bacterium also showed capability of exploiting the pesticide coumaphos as an alternative carbon source for growth. As the bacterium proved its ability to detoxify organic and inorganic xenobiotics, the usefulness of this microorganism for bioremediation is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Sugar acids {{can be used}} as {{platform}} {{chemicals to}} generate primary building blocks of industrially relevant products. Microbial production of these organic compounds at high yields requires the engineering of the enzymatic machinery and the presence of plasma membrane transporters able to export them outside the cells. In this study, several yeast carboxylic acid transporters belonging to the Jen family were screened for the transport of biotechnologically relevant sugar acids, namely gluconic, saccharic, mucic, xylaric and xylonic acid, and functionally characterised in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that Jen permeases are capable of transporting most of these sugar acids, although with different specificities. Saccharate is a substrate of the transporters ScJen 1 -S 271 Q and KlJen 2, gluconate of CaJen 2 and KlJen 2, and xylarate and <b>mucate</b> of CaJen 2. A molecular docking approach of these transporters identified the residues that {{play a major role in}} the substrate binding of these sugar acids, namely R 188 (ScJen 1), R 122 (CaJen 2) and R 127 (KlJen 2), all equivalent residues (TMS II). The identification of Jen members as sugar acid transporters can contribute to engineering efficient microbial cell factories with increased sugar acid production, as the ScJen 1 is able to promote substrate efflux...|$|E
40|$|The name Vibrio hollisae (synonym = Special Bacteriology group EF- 13) is {{proposed}} {{for a new}} group of 16 strains that occurred in stool cultures of patients with diarrhea. V. hollisae is a small gram-negative rod, which is motile with a single polar flagellum. No lateral or peritrichous flagella were observed, even when it was grown on a solid medium. Sodium chloride is required for growth, so V. hollisae is a halophilic vibrio. Strains were positive (36 degrees C, 24 or 48 h) for oxidase (Kovacs), indole production, nitrate reduction to nitrite, and fermentation of D-glucose (acid, no gas), L-arabinose, D-galactose, and D-mannose. Strains were negative for the following tests often used in enteric bacteriology: lipase (corn oil); deoxyribonuclease; gelatinase; methyl red; Voges-Proskauer; utilization of citrate, acetate, and malonate; L-lysine decarboxylase (Møllers); L-ornithine decarboxylase (Møllers); L-arginine dihydrolase (Møllers); growth in KCN medium; and acid production from D-adonitol, D-arabitol, cellobiose, dulcitol, erythritol, glycerol (25 % delayed positive at 7 days), i-(myo) -inositol, lactose, maltose, D-mannitol, melibiose, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, <b>mucate,</b> raffinose, L-rhamnose, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and D-xylose. None of the strains was motile (semisolid medium) at 36 degrees C at 48 h, but by 7 days 88 % were motile. The strains did not grow within 2 days when plated on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar or MacConkey agar, but they grew on sheep blood agar and marine agar. By DNA-DNA hybridization (75 degrees C, hydroxyapatite with (32) P), V. hollisae was only 0 to 4 % related to 21 named species in Vibrio and Photobacterium. The type strain is designated ATCC 33564, which has a mean guanineplus-cytosine content in DNA of 50 mol%. With the disk diffusion method V. hollisae had relatively large zones of inhibition around penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, colistin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfadiazine. Future studies should focus on the isolation of this new vibrio and its ecology and relationship to human diseases...|$|E
40|$|In 1985 {{the vernacular}} name Enteric Group 90 was coined {{for a small}} group of strains that had been {{referred}} to our laboratory as probable strains of Salmonella but did not agglutinate in Salmonella typing antisera. By DNA-DNA hybridization (hydroxyapatite method, 32 P), seven strains of Enteric Group 90 were found to be closely related (98 to 100 % at 60 degrees C and 94 to 100 % at 75 degrees C) to the first strain received (0370 - 85). The relatedness of Enteric Group 90 to 62 strains of other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was only 6 to 41 %, with the highest values obtained with strains of Salmonella, Kluyvera, Shigella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter. We propose a new genus, Trabulsiella, with a single new species, Trabulsiella guamensis, for the highly related group of eight strains formerly known as Enteric Group 90. The type strain is designated ATCC 49490 (CDC 0370 - 85). T. guamensis strains grew well at 36 degrees C and had positive reactions in the following tests: methyl red, citrate utilization (Simmons) (38 % positive at day 1, 88 % positive at 2 days), H 2 S production, lysine decarboxylase, arginine dihydrolase (50 % positive at 2 days, 100 % positive at 7 days), ornithine decarboxylase, motility, growth in KCN medium, <b>mucate</b> fermentation, acetate utilization, nitrate reduction to nitrite, weak tyrosine hydrolysis (88 % positive at 2 days, 100 % positive at 7 days), and ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) test. The strains fermented D-glucose with gas production and fermented L-arabinose, cellobiose, D-galactose, D-galacturonate, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-sorbitol, trehalose, and D-xylose. T. guamensis strains had negative reactions in the following tests: indole production (13 % positive), Voges-Proskauer, urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deaminase, malonate utilization, lipase (corn oil), DNase, oxidase, pigment production, and acid production from adonitol, D-arabitol, dulcitol, erythritol, myo-inositol, melibiose, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, raffinose, and sucrose. There were delayed positive reactions for gelatin liquefaction (22 degrees C), which was positive at 12 to 23 days, esculin hydrolysis (13 % positive at day 1, 50 % positive at 7 days), lactose fermentation (13 % positive at 3 to 7 days, 100 % positive at 8 to 10 days), glycerol fermentation (88 % positive at 7 days), and salicin fermentation (13 % positive at day 1, 88 % positive at 7 days). All strains were susceptible by the disk diffusion method to colistin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and most strains were susceptible to sulfadiazine (75 % susceptible), tetracycline (88 %), and carbenicillin (75 %). The strains were resistant to penicillin, cephalothin, and ampicillin. The strains were isolated from vacuum cleaner dust (five strains), soil (one strain), and human feces (two strains). Although T. guamensis can occur in human diarrheal stools, {{there is no evidence that}} it actually causes diarrhea. Its main interest to clinical microbiologists may be its possible misidentification as a strain Salmonella...|$|E
