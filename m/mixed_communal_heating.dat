40|$|AbstractRegarded as one {{solution}} to the problem of how to enable older people to retain their independence, extra-care housing, where each resident has their own self-contained dwelling and access to communal facilities and to care, has received extensive funding in recent years. Implicit in the concept of specialist housing is the notion of ‘special’ occupants, imagined older people. Adopting a socio-technical approach, this paper considers how ideas about ageing inform those aspects of extra-care-housing-design that relate to thermal comfort. The paper draws on semi-structured interviews with 13 people involved in the design, development and management of UK-based extra-care housing. Participants characterised imagined occupants as vulnerable to cold, at risk from fuel poverty and liable to be burned by hot surfaces or fall from high windows. These user representations were reportedly inscribed into the design of extra-care housing schemes through the inclusion of building features such as <b>communal</b> <b>heating,</b> under-floor heating, restricted window opening and heated corridors. The utilisation of stereotypical user representations of older people raises questions, given that older people's thermal comfort needs can be highly diverse.

Optimisation analysis of the target configuration of municipal heat generating plant is analysed in the paper. The work concerns repowering the existing conventional heat generating plant according to eight different scenarios of the plant configuration meeting technical and environmental requirements forecasted for the year of 2035. The maximum demand for heat of the system supplied by the plant is 185 MW.

Numerous studies have {{reported}} on overheating in urban contexts the majority of which {{have focused on the}} influences of external factors, such as: heat waves and climatic change. To date very little research has examined the more insidious issue of chronic year-round overheating in temperate climatic zones. The present study begins by reviewing the potential implications of planning and legislative constraints underlying urban residential design. A case study example is then introduced to examine the potential manifestation of such issues in practice. Detailed field monitoring and survey data from a number of newly built flats in a multi-residential block in London, is presented. Typical {{of a new generation of}} urban dwellings the development incorporates a high thermal specification together with low carbon building services, such as <b>communal</b> <b>heating</b> systems and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Through detailed zonal measurements of a broad range of environmental and building services parameters it has been possible to isolate the key factors underpinning poor overheating performance for these flats. The findings of this case study are part of a larger research project investigating the causes of overheating in high density urban dwellings across Greater London. The results suggest that the causes of chronic overheating in these modern low-energy flats are multiple, but typically share common factors stemming from poorly integrated architectural and MEP design decisions. Conflicts between regional planning policies, UK building regulations, and health and safety legislation appear to be compounding the problem...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{function}} of Annex 54 is {{the analysis of}} microgeneration performance in buildings. Within the context of Annex 54, the term ‘microgeneration’ relates to {{a broad range of}} low-carbon technologies that can provide heating, cooling and/or power to buildings and communities. These include fuel cells and engine-based polygeneration systems, heat pumps, PV, micro wind power and biomass. Microgeneration technologies can be deployed individually or in combination (so-called hybrid systems). Whilst the primary use of microgeneration is to service the energy demands of a building or a community, microgeneration technologies could also play a role in wider energy networks such as <b>communal</b> <b>heating</b> schemes or (more typically) local electrical networks. However, the widespread participation of microgeneration in an energy network presupposes that those networks have evolved to accommodate and best utilise the microgeneration resources. Currently, this is rarely the case and microgeneration technologies tend to be connected piecemeal to existing networks, which have been designed to transport power, in one direction, from large central generators to the end user {{at the end of the}} network. The role of this report is to set the operation of microgeneration in buildings within this wider operational context. The report therefore focuses on connection into electrical networks and develops two main themes. First, the impact of microgeneration on existing electrical systems is explored. Second, the report looks ahead as to how microgeneration could be best utilised in energy networks – this will encompass approaches to control, related technologies such as energy storage (including hybrid vehicles) and demand-side control. The report draws on studies undertaken by Annex 54 partner organizations, papers presented at recent Microgen conferences [1, 2] – organized by Annex members – and work done within the Highly Distributed Energy Futures (HIDEF, 2013) consortium, a group of University partners who were the UK representatives on the Annex...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{deep cuts}} in carbon {{emissions}} from existing homes {{will be one of}} the major challenges facing social landlords over coming decades. The viability of meeting this goal for existing Peabody stock has been assessed for this report. The findings indicate that there is great potential to meet this goal through physical improvements to existing Peabody estates. However, if challenging carbon reduction targets are to be met, action by Government to decarbonise the grid and action by residents to constrain energy demand is also a necessity. Substantial stock refurbishment is likely to be required for Peabody estates, with solid-walled dwellings being insulated and estates being connected to low-carbon <b>communal</b> <b>heating</b> systems where viable. To achieve deeper emission cuts, micro-generation technologies such as solar photovoltaics are likely to be required. Even with considerable financial support from Government, these improvements will require substantial extra expenditure. In fact, this research points to a future context for carbon reduction refurbishment at Peabody where improvements may not lead to overall savings over the long term. As a result, if rent increases were used to fund the considered emission reduction measures, they would outweigh fuel bill savings, leaving residents worse-off financially. If the task of carrying out comprehensive carbon reduction refurbishment is taken up Peabody, or any social landlord, this research implies that this would be likely to lead to increased costs that the current funding model for social housing is unlikely to be geared up to deliver. This raises important questions on how this increased funding should be delivered. Deep emission cuts can be achieved in social housing, but this research implies that strong action is required by all stakeholders involved, in particular Government, residents, and landlords such as Peabody. This report goes some way towards clarifying some of the challenges and issues involved, and points towards strategies for making strong action on climate change mitigation in the social housing sector a reality...|$|R

Genetic gains and profits were estimated under nine levels of farmers' participation and three scenarios of controlled breeding achieved in the breeding programme, as well as under three cooperative flock sizes, ewe to ram mating ratios and durations of ram use for breeding. Under fully controlled breeding, that is, when there is no gene flow between participating (P) and non-participating (NP) flocks, profits ranged from Birr 36. 9 at 90 % of participation to Birr 21. 3 at 10 % of participation. However, genetic progress was not affected adversely. When there was gene flow from the NP to P flocks, profits declined from Birr 28. 6 to Birr - 3. 7 as participation declined from 90 to 10 %.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{parts of our}} paper. Firstly, it gives an {{overview}} about the goals and factors which affect the integration of local communal services. Horizontal integration means joining the various individual service providers, such as water supply and sewage, <b>communal</b> waste, district <b>heating,</b> streetcleaning, public transportation companies. Spatial integration means joining the service providers of neighbouring communities. In recent years several examples can be observed for both types of integration in Hungary. Three main factors behind this trend {{will be discussed in}} detail: economies of scope argument, economies of scale argument and managerial power and prestige argument. According to the economies of scope argument, local service providers use similar physical assets (such as vehicles, office buildings, maintenance tools and so on) and similar skills and organizations. Joining of the respective customer bases brings synergies in the management of users (metering, billing, call centres and so on), and in administration costs. Bigger organizations may be in a better position in order to raise the funds required for financing their projected investments also. The economies of scale argument lies behind the spatial extension of the providers of the same service. However, spatial extension leads to the increasing cost of spatial interactions among the various sites of companies also which effect can overweight the potential cost reduction due to the increasing return. Horizontal and spatial integration can be driven also by managerial attitude towards empire building. The second part of the paper presents a short survey about the previous controversial empirical findings of the integration of local communal services in various countries. In the third part our own empirical research is presented, firstly as a case study about the integration of <b>communal</b> waste, district <b>heating,</b> real estate services and other general services in the Western Hungarian town of Gy 5 r (which has about 130 thousand inhabitants) and secondly a comparative study about six other Hungarian towns (with similar size).

The advantage of this system can be demonstrated to be both economical and ecological. Safety analysis showed that a higher degree of automation does not compromise safe operation. In Hamburg these findings {{led to the development of}} a training simulator for the operating personnel. The optimisation techniques presented in part 1 can therefore be implemented in a model, which provides a very good analogy to the real network. In part 2 innovative forms of presentation of hydraulic relations of the controled District Heating network where developed. They where realised in a computer program. This program was installed in the District Heating control room. The target of part 3 is the practical application of BoFit for the generation of optimized propositions for operation mode of the District Heating net-work.

40|$|The {{sharing of}} habitat by wild and {{domestic}} animals {{may result in}} pathogen transmission, notably via ectoparasite vectors such as ticks. Interfaces between protected and communal lands constitute sharp transitions between areas occupied by host communities that are extremely contrasted in terms of com-position, diversity and density. Empirical characterizations of tick communities and of their vertebrate hosts are strongly relevant for understanding the mechanisms leading to disease transmission between wild and domestic animals. In the present study we aimed at depicting the pattern of spatial variation in the density of immature ticks at such an interface located in Zimbabwe. At {{the end of the}} 2011 rainy season, we applied a hierarchical repeated protocol to collect ticks. We used the dragsampling method in the vegetation surrounding water pans used by ungulates in 3 distinct landscape compartments (i. e. national park, <b>mixed</b> compartment and <b>communal</b> lands) characterized by a differential use by wild and domestic hosts. We combined generalized linear mixed models with site occupancy models to (1) assess tick aggregation levels at different spatial scales, (2) identify and disentangle factors which influence the density and probability of tick detection, and (3) compare robust estimations of tick densities among the landscape compartments. Ticks belonging to the Amblyomma and Riphicephalus genuses were found to be the most abundant. At small scale, ticks were more often detected in the afternoon and were more abun-dant close to water pans for Amblyomma and Riphicephalus genuses. Riphicephalus spp. density was also higher in grassland and bushland vegetation types as compared to woodland vegetation type. At large scale, for the three detected genuses, density was much higher near water pans located in the communal lands as compared to the national park and mixed compartment. Given that host community’s diversity is much lower in the communal areas than in the two other landscape compartments, these results are compatible with a dilution effect but not sufficient to demonstrate this effect without additional studies. Up to date, it is the first utilization of these rigorous sampling and statistical modelling methodologies to estimate tick density in African ecosystem simultaneously at large and small scales.

40|$|Residential {{buildings}} under co-ownership are properties {{governed by}} <b>mixed</b> systems of <b>communal</b> and individual property rights. Their management demands {{a high level}} of organized cooperation and coordination among them. However, owners’ collective actions are never straightforward owing to their temptation to free ride. Without owners’ collective actions, management works can be delayed or even cancelled, which results in deteriorating building conditions. With the increasing number of people living in co-owned residential buildings, whether they can overcome collective action problems and effectively manage their properties becomes important to long-term management of building stocks. Therefore, this study aims to assess management performance of co-owned residential buildings and to explore the variations of the management performance from a collective action perspective. A rigorous tool for assessing management performance of co-owned residential buildings was developed in this study. The tool consisted of a hierarchy of key performance indicators which evaluate the capability of an owners’ group to make collective decisions, enforce management rules, and monitor its buildings’ condition. The application of the tool on a co-owned residential building generates a performance profile representing its management performance. The proposed tool was used to assess the management performance of 74 sampled buildings in Hong Kong. The survey data was collected from the sampled buildings through desk studies, face-to-face interviews, questionnaires by post, and on- site inspections. Multiple regression analyses were applied to investigate the effects of the exogenous factors on building management performance. The empirical results showed that large-size owners groups were more likely to perform well in managing their properties. Homogeneous owners groups were associated with a greater likelihood to achieve high management performance. More importantly, the empirical results revealed that the owners group of a co-owned residential building were more likely obtain high performance in managing the communal properties under the following circumstances: 1) well-defined boundaries of the communal properties; 2) a fair distribution of their rights and responsibilities to management; 3) a presence of effective mechanism to regulate their use of the communal properties; and 4) a way to rapidly resolve their disputes over management. The major contribution {{of this study is to}} the field of building management. The proposed tool in this study can used by owners, property managers, investors, and policy-makers to access to management information on co-owned residential buildings, which helps them make better decisions on buildings. In addition, findings of this study provided an explanation of the variations in building management performance, which has great implications for government policies that aim to encourage owners to cooperate in management of their properties. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
