5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing <b>more</b> <b>air</b> to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|All six LSTs were {{unloaded}} by 11:45. There {{was little}} opposition. Eleven Japanese {{soldiers were killed}} by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom fled into the interior. American casualties {{on the day of the}} landing came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three <b>more</b> <b>air</b> raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, but most were small.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five Whirlwind fighter-bombers—German fighters beat them back. Several <b>more</b> <b>air</b> attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without success for the British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E

5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in <b>more</b> <b>air</b> from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{command of}} the naval force {{was taken by the}} US Seventh Fleet, and the bulk of the naval power {{provided}} was also from the US. The United Kingdom also provided a small naval task force including an aircraft carrier and several cruisers. Eventually, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand provided ships as well. Several hundred fighter-bombers of the Fifth Air Force were positioned within the perimeter and in Japan, and just off the coast were US Navy aircraft aboard the USS Valley Forge and the USS Philippine Sea. By the end of the battle the Eighth Army had <b>more</b> <b>air</b> support than General Omar Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group in Europe during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice to chill foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating <b>more</b> <b>air</b> over the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air attaché, an Air Force colonel. The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 <b>more</b> <b>Air</b> Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five air operations centers were created in Laos – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E

25|$|A {{combustor}} {{must contain}} and maintain stable combustion despite very high air flow rates. To do so combustors are carefully designed to first mix and ignite {{the air and}} fuel, and then mix in <b>more</b> <b>air</b> to complete the combustion process. Early gas turbine engines used a single chamber known as a can type combustor. Today three main configurations exist: can, annular and cannular (also referred to as can-annular tubo-annular). Afterburners are often considered another type of combustor.|$|E
25|$|MotoGP-class {{motorcycles}} are {{not restricted}} to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; {{the weight of the}} extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing <b>more</b> <b>air</b> and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still <b>more</b> <b>air</b> and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|E

25|$|Free-flow diving helmets {{avoid the}} dead space problem by {{supplying}} far <b>more</b> <b>air</b> than the diver can use, and eliminating the oro-nasal compartment. This makes the whole {{interior of the}} helmet effectively fresh air, as it is adequately flushed during and after each exhalation {{at the cost of}} significantly higher gas usage in open circuit systems. This also minimises work of breathing increases due to breathing apperatus resistance to flow, making freeflow helmets particularly suitable for applications where severe exertion may be required.|$|E

25|$|Pamunkey homes, called yihakans (or yehakins), {{were long}} and narrow; they were {{described}} as “longhouses” by English colonists. They were structures made from bent saplings lashed together at the top to make a barrel shape. Indians covered the saplings with woven mats or bark. The 17th-century historian William Strachey thought that bark was harder to acquire, as he noticed that only higher-status families owned bark-covered houses. In summer, when the heat and humidity increased, the mats could be rolled up or removed to allow <b>more</b> <b>air</b> circulation.|$|E
