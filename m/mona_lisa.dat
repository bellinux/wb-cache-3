5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b>|$|E
5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device to scan the {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 crime drama film <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area {{surrounding}} the station, coupled with urban decay, {{made it an}} ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage of crime and prostitution around King's Cross referred back to the film.|$|E
5|$|City of Death {{features}} the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Romana (Lalla Ward). Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, {{to steal the}} <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> to finance experiments in time travel {{in the hope of}} averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.|$|E

5|$|The Louvre Palace was altered {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} Middle Ages. In the 14thcentury, CharlesV converted the building into a residence and in 1546, FrancisI renovated {{the site in}} French Renaissance style. Francis acquired {{what would become the}} nucleus of the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> After LouisXIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted the Louvre {{to be used as a}} residence for artists.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E

5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{assigned}} Lisa's name to {{at least}} four different paintings and her identity {{to at least}} ten different people. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week. In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa. The note, written by Agostino Vespucci in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. The <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by King Francis I; after the French Revolution, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the Louvre in Paris, where {{it is part of a}} French national collection.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

40|$|What gives <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisas</b> smile such {{a mysterious}} quality? Livingstone (2000) has {{suggested}} that the portrait changes its expression depending on where on the portrait the observer looks. The mouth, which is the essential feature of <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisas</b> remarkable expression (Kontsevich & Tyler, 2004), appears to form an enigmatic smile. Due to sfumato technique (Gombrich, 2005), this impression of a smile is more prominent in the gradual luminance changes that observers perceive mainly in the periphery of their vision— that is, in low spatial-frequency ranges. It is less prominent in the fine details that observers perceive only at the center of their gaze, in high spatial-frequency ranges. 1 Consequent-ly, the subtle smile one perceives while looking at <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisas</b> eyes (when her mouth appears blurred) vanishes when one attempts to verify this impression by looking a...|$|R
