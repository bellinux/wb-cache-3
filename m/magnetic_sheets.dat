It involves a resistive frequency selective surface (FSS) sandwiched between {{two layers of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets.</b> The measurement results reveal that this structure exhibits − 13 dB reflectivity in the frequency range of 7. 9 – 18 GHz while the thickness is only 1. 7 mm. The reflectivity bandwidth {{at the level of}} − 10 dB is 11. 4 GHz which is much wider than that of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> with non-resistive FSS or the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> without FSS. The effect of resistive FSS on the performance of the multilayered absorber is discussed in detail. It is concluded that an embedded resistive double loops FSS can result in a secondary resonance peak which obviously broadens the reflectivity bandwidth of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets.</b> 1...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - Experiments form the main approach. Analytical results previously obtained with a simplified rectangular laminated structure are confirmed with a standard cylindrical magnetic core. Findings - Three frequency domains are defined, depending on the skin depth relative to the thickness of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets.</b> A methodological approach is proposed for each domain. For higher frequencies, the magnetic core can be considered as transparent for external field computation. Research limitations/implications - The HF model is valid for skin depths much lower than the thickness of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets.</b> Practical implications - The proposed HF model provides a link between the weak field measured in the natural void existing between the stator core and the housing of large electrical machines. With such a link, it is possible to develop a new monitoring system able to detect and to localize the partial discharges in the stator winding of a large machine. Originality/value - The low-frequency limit of the model has been measured. It corresponds to a ratio of 1 / 40 between the skin depth and the magnetic sheet thickness.

40|$|The {{concept of}} loss {{separation}} {{based on the}} Statistical Theory of Losses (STL) provides complete and accurate description of the frequency dependence of the energy losses in non-oriented soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> under the assumption of uniform magnetization reversal through the sheet cross-section.

Different conclusions regarding the dynamic loss analysis and its decomposition into the classical and excess loss components correspondingly emerge. In this paper we discuss detailed investigations on the broadband energy loss versus frequency behavior in different non-oriented Fe-Si and low-carbon steel sheets.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new method for the {{accurate}} characterization of soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> using a permeameter {{based on the}} precise compensation of the magnetomotive force (MMF) drop in the flux-closing yoke. It has been developed in order to overcome the systematic uncertainty affecting {{the value of the}} magnetic fieldstrength in single sheet testers when obtained, according to the standards, through the measurement of the magnetizing current. This phenomenon is more critical for high permeability materials, because of the reduced MMF drop across the sample. While additional sensors and auxiliary windings have been proposed in the literature, a novel approach is demonstrated here, based {{on the use of the}} permeameter upper half yoke as the MMF drop sensor and of an auxiliary winding on the lower half yoke, implementing compensation. This solution, dispensing one from dealing with the usually small signal levels of the conventional MMF drop sensors (e. g. Chattock coils), provides best results with the introduction of wedge-shaped magnetic poles, in order to accurately define the magnetic path length. The method is validated by measurements of power loss, apparent power, and hysteresis cycles on non-oriented and grain-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets, which are compared with local measurements performed on the same samples using H-coil and B-coil across a uniformly magnetized region...|$|E
40|$|Estimation {{of power}} {{transformer}} no-load loss {{is a critical}} issue {{in the design of}} distribution transformers. Any deviation in estimation of the core losses during the design stage can lead to a financial penalty for the transformer manufacturer. In this paper an effective and novel method is proposed to determine all components of the iron core losses applying a combination of the empirical and numerical techniques. In this method at the first stage all computable components of the core losses are calculated, using Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling and analysis of the transformer iron core. This method takes into account <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> anisotropy, joint losses and stacking holes. Next, a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization technique is employed to estimate the incomputable components of the core losses. This method provides a chance for improvement of the core loss estimation over the time when more measured data become available. The optimization process handles the singular deviations caused by different manufacturing machineries and labor during the transformer manufacturing and overhaul process. Therefore, application of this method enables different companies to obtain different results for the same designs and materials employed, using their historical data. Effectiveness of this method is verified by inspection of 54 full size distribution transformer measurement data...|$|E

Spin density waves (SDW) have been found with some confidence. They are either incommensurate with the lattice period or {{the ratio of the}} respective periods is far away from ratio of small integers. SDW shape is very unconventional i. e. differs from the sinusoidal shape. Magnetic order starts with lowered temperature as narrow sheets of the significant electron spin density separated by areas with very small spin density. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>sheets</b> are likely to be ordered in the alternate anti-ferromagnetic fashion as the material as whole behaves similarly to collinear anti-ferromagnet. Further lowering of temperature simply expands sheet thickness leading to the near triangular SDW. Finally, sheets fill the whole available space and almost rectangular shape of SDW is reached. Substantial maximum amplitude of SDW appears at the temperature just below the magnetic onset temperature, and this maximum amplitude increases slightly with lowering temperature. The square root from the mean squared hyperfine field behaves versus temperature according to the universality class (1, 2), i. e., with the electronic spin space having dimensionality equal unity and the real space having dimensionality equal two.
