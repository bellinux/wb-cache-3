5|$|In early 2008, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Boycott would be awarded a role amongst the England coaching staff, pertaining {{in particular to}} the coaching of Andrew Flintoff back from injury. On 8 May 2008, however, the ECB revealed that Boycott would not hold such a position. The two {{had been involved in}} the past, and while Flintoff is an admirer of Boycott, the ECB stressed any coaching relationship would only be informal. Boycott, however, used to give informal talks to younger cricket players during his career, and the media speculated that he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place coaching the England U19s. Boycott continued in his commentating career for TMS, criticising the England team's approach to the ODI matches under Pietersen in India in November 2008. Also in November, Daily Mail contributor Leo McKinstry published a new biography on Boycott.|$|E
5|$|With {{the news}} of the {{alarming}} Russian operations against the left wing of the army, Murat reassumed command of the cavalry reserve, ordering Nansouty to retake command of the 1st heavy cavalry division and follow the concentration of the army towards Eylau. Joining his men in Warsaw, Nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination, but did not arrive until 13 February 1807, five days after the Battle of Eylau and too late to take part in any action. On 14 February, Nansouty learned of the death of his comrade and former commander during the Revolutionary Wars, General d'Hautpoul, who had been fatally wounded during the heroic cavalry charges at Eylau. After the battle, the Emperor decided that the army was to take winter quarters. To ensure the safety of his outposts, he sent Murat with a powerful column, including Nansouty's men, with the mission of pushing back any enemy they <b>might</b> <b>find.</b> <b>A</b> short skirmish involving the 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at Wolfsdorf on 10 March, before it was decided that all the heavy cavalry would be sent to the lower Vistula, where they were to rest and be reinforced.|$|E
25|$|Hispano-Suiza became Hispano Aviación {{after the}} Spanish Civil War. In 1941 a final unit was {{assembled}} using recovered parts of an E-34 and a Gipsy engine. Hispano had hopes of restarting production, suggesting the HS-34 <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> rôle as a glider tug. On 18 April 1942, a successful test took place, flown by the usual Hispano test pilot Fernando Floes Solis, but the type was not {{accepted by the}} military. Instead, it flew with the civil Aero Club of Seville. Lage suggests that this aircraft may be the HS-41 {{referred to in the}} 1942 Hispano catalogue.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} factor encouraging Comanche raids of Mexican ranches was the huge demand for horses and mules by the Anglo-Americans now flooding into lands {{west of the}} Mississippi River. The Comanches could meet that demand by breeding and selling horses from their herds, capturing and training wild horses from the numerous herds in Comancheria, or raiding Mexican ranches and taking horses. The last was often the preferred option of ambitious young men striving to become rich in a well-to-do pastoral society. Comanche raids for horses in Texas and along the Rio Grande in Mexico increased in 1831 and afterwards. A young, poor, or low ranking Comanche man could better his circumstances—albeit at great risk to his life—by raiding for horses and human captives. The wealth he obtained would enable him to buy a Comanche wife—or he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> first, second, or third wife among the captives.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port where he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was nowhere in sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E
500|$|Rodríguez de Montalvo's {{description}} of Calafia, her people and her country {{was based upon}} many centuries of stories of Amazons, groups of woman warriors who fought like men. As well, {{the story of an}} island paradise filled with gold and pearls was a recurring theme that Rodríguez de Montalvo was familiar with. In seeking new land, Spanish explorers were often led onward after hearing about a land of gold, or a land ruled by women. California historian Lynn Townsend White, Jr wrote that they considered the as-yet undiscovered California [...] "a land of Orient with fantastic attributes". The novel about Esplandián and Calafia's domain had a strong influence on the searching Conquistadors, who believed they <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> nation of women and riches somewhere {{at the edge of the}} known world.|$|E

500|$|While {{they had}} {{demonstrated}} that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using [...] of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, {{in the form of}} graphite. He felt he would need about [...] of graphite and [...] of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of materiel would require a lot of money.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sir Eglamour of Artois is a Middle English verse romance {{that was}} written {{sometime}} around 1350. It is a narrative poem of about 1300 lines, a tail-rhyme romance that was quite popular in its day, judging {{from the number of}} copies that have survived – four manuscripts from the 15th century or earlier and a manuscript and five printed editions from the 16th century. The poem tells a story that is constructed from a large number of elements found in other medieval romances and modern scholarly opinion has been critical of it because of this, describing it as unimaginative and of poor quality. Medieval romance as a genre, however, concerns the reworking of [...] "the archetypal images of romance" [...] and if this poem is viewed from a 15th-century perspective as well as from a modern standpoint – and it was obviously once very popular, even being adapted into a play in 1444 – one <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> [...] "romance [...] is carefully structured, the action highly unified, the narration lively." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{length of}} ladies' evening gloves are {{referred}} to in terms of [...] "buttons", whether they in fact have buttons or not. The word is derived from French, and the exact measure is actually a bit longer than one inch. Wrist length gloves are usually eight-button, those at the elbow are 16, mid-biceps are 22 and full shoulder length are 30. Opera gloves are between 16 and 22inches long, though some gloves can be as long as 29 or 30inches. To fit oneself for gloves, measure all around the hand at the widest part of the palm where the knuckles are, but excluding the thumb. The measurement in inches is the glove size, but if one's arms are large, it may be practical to go up a size. Generally, an evening glove {{is considered to be}} a true [...] "opera-length" [...] glove if it reaches to mid-biceps or higher on the wearer's arm, notwithstanding its actual length in inches or buttons; therefore, a petite woman <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> glove with a measurement of 16 or 17inches adequate for the purpose, while a tall woman might need a glove longer than 22inches. A glove shorter than elbow-length should not be referred to as an [...] "opera-length glove" [...] or [...] "opera glove" [...] under any circumstances.|$|E

While the emperor kept him at his court he urged him, by personal persuasion and through the instrumentality of others, to accept the Christian faith, because there would then be a more intimate friendship between them, and a Christian people would more readily come to his aid and to the aid of his friends if both peoples were worshippers of the same God. At length, by the assistance of divine grace, he brought about his conversion, and when he had been sprinkled with the holy water of baptism he himself received him from the sacred font and adopted him as his son. When, then, he desired to send him back to his own land in order that he might, by his assistance, seek to recover his dominions, he began to make diligent enquiry in order that he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> holy and devoted man who could go and continue with him, and who might strengthen him and his people, and by teaching the doctrine of salvation might induce them to receive the faith of the Lord." ...|$|E
