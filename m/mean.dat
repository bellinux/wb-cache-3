5|$|Although the <b>Mean</b> Green had not {{scored on}} its first {{possession}} in its previous eight games, the team scored on its opening drive against the Midshipmen when wide receiver Casey Fitzgerald caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza. The <b>Mean</b> Green recovered an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff and scored another touchdown on the following drive. After the Midshipmen kicked a field goal on their first possession, North Texas added another touchdown, giving them a 21–3 lead. Navy scored a touchdown with seven seconds remaining in the quarter. The period ended with the <b>Mean</b> Green ahead, 21–10.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the <b>mean</b> curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the <b>mean</b> curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its <b>mean</b> curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the <b>mean</b> curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the <b>mean</b> curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{constructed}} by the Dinn Corporation, <b>Mean</b> Streak {{opened to the public}} on on May 11, 1991, as the tallest wooden coaster in the world with the longest drop height. Cedar Point closed <b>Mean</b> Streak on September 16, 2016, casting doubt and uncertainty regarding the ride's future. The park dropped subtle hints over the following year that the ride was being refurbished. On August 16, 2017, Cedar Point officially announced the conversion of <b>Mean</b> Streak into Steel Vengeance, marketed as the first hybrid hypercoaster. Before its official opening, a virtual recreation of the ride was made available in the video game, Planet Coaster.|$|E

5|$|The next <b>Mean</b> Green drive {{ended in}} another interception, {{this time by}} Midshipmen linebacker Matt Wimsatt. After the ensuing drive stalled at midfield, the Midshipmen downed a punt at the North Texas two-yard line. Two plays later the <b>Mean</b> Green were called for holding in the end zone, giving Navy a safety. Campbell {{returned}} the ensuing free kick for a touchdown, giving the Midshipmen a 74–56 lead. Running back Micah Mosley scored another touchdown for the <b>Mean</b> Green, but their two-point conversion attempt failed, leaving them down 74–62. The <b>Mean</b> Green attempted another onside kick, but Navy recovered. One first down was enough to enable the Midshipmen to run out the clock for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the <b>mean</b> curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the <b>mean</b> curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero <b>mean</b> curvature.|$|E

25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population <b>mean</b> of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic <b>mean</b> of the given property while considering every member of the population.

The sample <b>mean</b> may differ from the population <b>mean,</b> especially for small samples.

25|$|The {{instability}} {{means that}} increasing the <b>mean</b> field above zero {{a little bit}} produces a statistical fraction of spins which are + which is bigger than {{the value of the}} <b>mean</b> field.

Of all body styles, pick-up trucks had the highest <b>mean</b> age in 2001 (9.4 years), followed by cars with a <b>mean</b> age of 8.4 years and van with a <b>mean</b> age of 7.0 years. As SUVs are part of a relatively new consumer trend originating mostly in the 1990s, SUVs had the lowest <b>mean</b> age of any body style in the US (6.1 years).
