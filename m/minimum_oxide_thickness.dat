40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates {{the effects of}} four {{controllable}} variables on the metallurgy and geometry of acute (30 to surface) laser percussion drilled holes in 2 mm thick flat pieces of nickel superalloy: CMSX- 4. Design of experiment (DOE) and statistical modelling {{were used in the}} experimental study to understand parameter interactions. Assist gas pressure, nozzle stand-off distance, focal plane position (FPP), and number of pulses were chosen as the independent process variables. A central composite design (CCD) was chosen as it offered the most economical number of experiments for the required information. The response sur-face method (RSM) was used to develop three models. The significant factors in each model were identified based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the models were checked by complete residual analysis.

40|$|Within {{this paper}} the {{applicability}} of three methods to clean and condition the surface of silicon wafers by an ultra-thin oxide layer were tested: two UV/O 3 sources (an Hg vapor lamp and a high efficiency excimer module) {{as well as a}} wet chemical oxidation in HNO 3. It has been demonstrated that organic residues resulting from wafering and masking the surface during alkaline texturing can be removed by UV/O 3 (Hg vapor lamp) exposure. Moreover the use of UV/O 3 (excimer) and HNO 3 oxides result in an improvement of passivation quality and emitter saturation current in combination with Al 2 O 3 /SiNx or AlN/SiNx passivation stacks. For n-type silicon wafers with a 70 Ω/sq. boron emitter and Al 2 O 3 /SiNx passivation very low j 0 e values of 49 fA/cm 2 are achieved by conditioning with UV/O 3 or HNO 3. Another important application of ultra-thin SiOx layers is as tunnel oxides for the rear side of the TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) cell concept [1, 2]. High iVOC values exceeding 720 mV on planar samples and 710 mV on textured samples are obtained with UV/O 3 grown tunnel oxides after annealing. The structural properties of the SiOx layers that were analyzed by XPS and compared to the iVOC data, indicate that a <b>minimum</b> <b>oxide</b> layer <b>thickness</b> of approx. 1. 4 nm and a high amount of oxygen rich sub oxides species (Si 2 O 3, close to the structure of stoichiometric SiO 2) are required to obtain a good interface passivation stable up to annealing temperatures of 900 °C...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{memory devices}} {{dominate}} the non-volatile memory market, with device structures that utilize charge storage in polysilicon floating gates imbedded in insulating silicon oxide films'. As demands for high storage density, high chip memory capacity, and decreasing process costs continue to mount, conventional flash memory {{has found it}} challenging to continue scaling and it may reach fundamental scaling limits because of the <b>minimum</b> tunnel <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> and poor charge retention due to defects in the tunneling oxide, necessitating modification {{in the implementation of}} the flash memory technology. In this study nano-segmented floating gate memories consisting of a uniform set of identical organic dye molecules were fabricated and evaluated for potential use as programmable charge storage and charge retention elements in a future flash memory technology. Viability of molecular thin films to serve as an energetically-uniform set of ~ 1 nm in size charge- retaining sites is tested on a series of molecular materials, the best performing of which are thermally evaporated thin films of 3, 4, 9, 10 - perylenetetracarboxylic bis-benzimidazole (PTCBI). The initial results show device durability over 105 program/erase cycles, with hysteresis window of up to 3. 3 V, corresponding to charge storage density as high as 5 x 1012 cm 2. Data shows that charge retention is improved for molecular films with lower carrier mobility, which for the first time experimentally confirms in a coherent material set that inhibiting charge transport by nano-segmented floating-gate structures benefits the memory retention. These results show a first step towards a possible approach to miniaturization of non-volatile memory by using molecules as segmented charge storage elements in the floating gate flash memory technology. by Sarah Paydavosi.

40|$|Carrier-selective {{contacts}} {{are one of}} the key {{enabling technologies}} to approach very high conversion efficiencies close to the theoretical limit of silicon solar cells. The tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) approach is an alternative to classical heterojunction solar cells enabling efficiencies up to 24. 4 %. The tunnel oxide is a core element of this contact as it has to reduce the minority carrier recombination but simultaneously must not hamper the majority carrier flow. This paper focuses on ozone-based oxidation techniques, which can potentially be cost effective and industrially feasible methods for the realization of ultra-thin tunnel oxide layers {{as an alternative to the}} oxidation in nitric acid (HNO 3) reference process. All investigated oxides were applied to the electron-selective contact (n-TOPCon) on planar and textured surfaces. It will be shown that both ozone based oxidation techniques (UV/O 3 photo-oxidation and wet-chemical oxidation in ozonized DI-H 2 O) enable high implied open circuit voltage (iVOC) values exceeding 720 mV on planar and 710 mV on textured surfaces, respectively. Further oxide properties as stoichiometry and layer thickness were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), spectral ellipsometry (SE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In compliance with earlier results it was found that a <b>minimum</b> <b>oxide</b> layer <b>thickness</b> (approximately 1. 3 nm) and a high amount of oxygen-rich sub oxide species are required to obtain a good surface passivation. Using such oxides, a wider range of temperatures can be used during the TOPCon annealing. Applying the ozone-based oxide layers to n-TOPCon solar cells resulted in a high VOC of up to 719 mV and a peak efficiency of 24. 9 %.

Uranium samples, all from the same lot, were prepared with different <b>oxide</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured using Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy.

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} {{two-dimensional}} simulations, provides a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} electrical characteristics of the Silicon germanium (SiGe) -base bipolar transistors on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. The impact of the buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> (T(OX)), the emitter width (W(E)), and the lateral distance between {{the edge of the}} intrinsic base and the reach-through region (L(col)) on both the AC and DC device characteristics was analyzed in detail. Regarding the DC characteristics, the simulation results suggest that a thicker T(OX) gives a larger base-collector breakdown voltage (BV(CEO)), whereas reducing the T(OX) leads to an enhanced maximum electric field at the B-C junction. As for the AC characteristics, cut-off frequency (f(T)) increases slightly with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> and finally saturates to a constant value when the buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> is about 0. 15 mu m. The collector-substrate capacitance (C(CS)) decreases with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> while the maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)) increases with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness.</b> Furthermore, the impact of self-heating effects in the device was analyzed in various areas. The thermal resistance {{as a function of the}} buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> indicates that the thermal resistance of the SiGe-base bipolar transistor on a SOI substrate is slightly higher than that of a bulk SiGe-base bipolar transistor.

40|$|There {{are only}} few methods {{available}} for predicting {{the age of}} cracks that are found in high temperature structural components during service; among the promising ones is the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> measurement technique. <b>Oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> profiles are taken from crack surfaces of components and used for predicting the rates of crack propagation. This technique is particularly suitable for high temperature components fabricated from ferritic steels commonly used in power plants that run on fossil fuels.

In this study, the oxidation characteristics of an American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Grade P 91 ferritic steel used in high temperature piping is characterized. The literature shows that there are four primary mechanisms that influence the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> during high temperature exposure. Initially, the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> increases in a linear fashion with time and then as steady-state conditions are established, the parabolic relationship takes over. Multiple types of oxides with different rate characteristics can also form. Oxide degradation can occur by spallation due to porosity and formation of cracks.
