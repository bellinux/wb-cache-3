40|$|Since the {{discovery}} {{in the early}} 1980 s that 1 -octen- 3 -ol, isolated from oxen breath, attracts tsetse fly, there has been growing interest in exploring {{the use of this}} semiochemical as a possible generic lure for trapping host-seeking mosquitoes. Intriguingly, traps baited with 1 -octen- 3 -ol captured significantly more females of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, than control traps, but failed to attract the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that this attractant is detected with enantioselective odorant receptors (ORs) expressed only in <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps.</b> On the basis of indoor behavioral assays it has even been suggested that 1 -octen- 3 -ol might be a repellent to the southern house mosquito. Our approach was two-prong, i. e., to isolate 1 -octen- 3 -ol-sensitive ORs expressed in <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> and antennae of southern house female mosquito, and test the hypothesis that this semiochemical is a repellent. An OR with high transcript levels in <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps,</b> CquiOR 118 b, showed remarkable selectivity towards (R) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol, whereas an OR expressed in antennae, CquiOR 114 b, showed higher preference for (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol than its antipode. Repellency by a surface landing and feeding assay showed that not only racemic, but enantiopure (R) - and (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol are repellents at 1 % dose thus suggesting the occurrence of other (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol-sensitive OR(s). Female mosquitoes with ablated <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> were repelled by 1 -octen- 3 -ol, which implies that in addition to OR(s) in the <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps,</b> antennal OR(s) are essential for repellency activity...|$|R

50|$|The {{generalized}} {{condition in}} hexapods {{is for the}} first pair of maxillae to consist of a basal triangular sclerite called the cardo and a large central sclerite called the stipes from which arise three processes: the lacinia, the galea and the <b>maxillary</b> <b>palp.</b> The lacinia is often strongly sclerotized and toothed. It functions to cut and manipulate food in the mouth. The galea is a broad, scoop-like, lobe structure, which assists the maxillary palps in sampling items before ingestion. The <b>maxillary</b> <b>palp</b> is serially homologous to the walking leg while the cardo and stipes are regarded by most to be serially homologous to the first leg segment, the coxa.The labium is immediately posterior to the first maxillae and is formed from the fusion of the second maxillae, although in lower orders including the Archaeognatha (bristletails) and Thysanura (silverfish) the two maxillae are not completely fused. It consists of a basal submentum, which connects with the prementum through a narrow sclerite, the mentum. The labium forms the lower portion of the buccal cavity in insects. The prementum has a pair of labial palps laterally, and two broad soft lobes called the paraglossae medially. These paraglossae have two small slender lobes called glossae at their base.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} Aedes albopictus {{is a highly}} invasive species and competent vector of several arboviruses (e. g. dengue, chikungunya, Zika) and parasites (e. g. dirofilaria) of public health importance. Compared to other mosquito species, Ae. albopictus females exhibit a generalist host seeking {{as well as a}} very aggressive biting behaviour that are responsible for its high degree of nuisance. Several complex mosquito behaviours such as host seeking, feeding, mating or oviposition rely on olfactory stimuli that target a range of sensory neurons localized mainly on specialized head appendages such as antennae, <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> and the mouthparts. Results: With the aim to describe the Ae. albopictus olfactory repertoire we have used RNA-seq to reveal the transcriptome profiles of female antennae and <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps.</b> Male heads and whole female bodies were employed as reference for differential expression analysis. The relative transcript abundance within each tissue (TPM, transcripts per kilobase per million) and the pairwise differential abundance in the different tissues (fold change values and false discovery rates) were evaluated. Contigs upregulated in the antennae (620) and <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> (268) were identified and relative GO and PFAM enrichment profiles analysed. Chemosensory genes were described: overall, 77 odorant binding proteins (OBP), 82 odorant receptors (OR), 60 ionotropic receptors (IR) and 30 gustatory receptors (GR) were identified by comparative genomics and transcriptomics. In addition, orthologs of genes expressed in the female/male <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> and/or antennae and involved in thermosensation (e. g. pyrexia and arrestin 1), mechanosensation (e. g. piezo and painless) and neuromodulation were classified. Conclusions: We provide here the first detailed transcriptome of the main Ae. albopictus sensory appendages, i. e. antennae and <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps.</b> A deeper knowledge of the olfactory repertoire of the {{tiger mosquito}} will help to better understand its biology and may pave the way to design new attractants/repellents...|$|R

25|$|The {{males are}} roughly 20% {{smaller than the}} females, but they are morphologically very similar. However, as in all {{mosquito}} species, the antennae of the males {{in comparison to the}} females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the female. The <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females’ <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the Culicinae.) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery.

50|$|Specifically {{the process}} is as follows: first the odorant wafts towards an insects antenna or <b>maxillary</b> <b>palp</b> which is covered with hair like {{projections}} called sensilla. The odorant then enters through tiny pours in the exoskeleton (or cuticle) of that sensillum and diffuses into the fluid between the cells called extracellular fluids. There the odorant molecule binds to an odorant binding protein which transports it to a receptor and co-receptor (Orco) team {{on the surface of}} the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). This leads to the neuron firing an action potential down the axon. This signal is sent to the antennal lobe of the insects brain where it can then integrate the information with other signals from other sensilla.|$|E
40|$|Background: The malaria {{mosquito}} Anopheles gambiae {{has a high}} preference for human hosts, a characteristic that contributes greatly to its capacity for transmitting human malaria. A sibling species, An. quadriannulatus, has a quite different host preference and feeds mostly on bovids. For this reason it does not contribute to human malaria transmission. Host seeking in mosquitoes is modulated by the olfactory system, which is primarily housed in the antennae and <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps.</b> Therefore, the detection of differing host odors by sibling species may {{be reflected in the}} expression level of the olfactory genes involved. Accordingly, we compared the transcriptomes of the antennae and <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> of An. gambiae and An. quadriannulatus. Results: We identified seven relatively abundant olfactory receptors, nine ionotropic receptors and three odorant binding proteins that are substantially up-regulated in An. gambiae antennae. Interestingly, we find that the <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> of An. gambiae contain a species-specific olfactory receptor, Or 52, and five An. gambiae-specific gustatory receptors (AgGr 48 - 52) that are relatively abundant. These five gustatory receptors are also expressed in An. gambiae antennae, although at lower level, indicating a likely role in olfaction, rather than gustation. We also document an approximately three-fold higher overall expression of olfaction genes in the <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> of An. quadriannulatus, indicating an important role of this organ in the olfaction system of this species. Finally, the expression of the CO 2 receptor genes is five to six-fold higher in the zoophilic An. quadriannulatus, implying a much higher sensitivity for detecting CO 2. Conclusions: These results identify potential human host preference genes in the malaria vector An. gambiae. Interestingly, species-specific expression of several gustatory receptors in the olfactory organs indicate a role in olfaction rather than gustation. Additionally, a more expansive role for <b>maxillary</b> <b>palps</b> in olfaction is implicated than previously thought, albeit more so in the zoophilic An. quadriannulatus.
