25|$|Dispersal {{of assets}} and pre-positioning of material. The {{hub of the}} North Vietnamese <b>material</b> <b>distribution</b> was Hanoi with its {{numerous}} railheads, bridges, major roads and its seaport. Much of Hanoi however, along with other key port areas such as Haiphong, were off-limits to US air attack {{until late in the}} American war. During the bombing campaign over the north, facilities and installations were widely dispersed and concealed. Some 2,000 imported generators provided essential power, and oil and gas were shuttled ashore on small craft from Soviet ships and stored in thousands of small 55-gallon drums throughout the countryside, alongside roads and in rice paddies. A massive number of civilians were also evacuated to the countryside from the urban areas, along with factories and machine shops. Population was also dispersed with massive movement of civilians out of major cities like Hanoi, into the countryside. Prepositioning was essential to PAVN tactics. Every few miles stockpiles of tools and material were positioned, both on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and on key transportation routes within North Vietnam. Ready-reaction labor units were also held in various areas, deploying for action to repair bomb damage. Action units sometimes helped with supply movement, such as floating 55-gallon drums of fuel down waterways – a crude yet sometimes effective method of moving such material in bulk. Soviet ships also aided dispersal by bringing in fuel and other material already pre-packed in drums, offloaded on to barges for quick distribution, with the ships themselves off-limits to US air attack.|$|E
500|$|As war clouds cast {{an ominous}} shadow over Europe {{in the late}} 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders {{considered}} how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "...the program of persecution has stirred up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." [...] During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership {{in support of the}} nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war <b>material,</b> <b>distribution</b> of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable [...] "victory gardens".|$|E

Titled Data-driven Material Modeling (DdMM), this approach utilizes external and user-generated data sets for the evaluation of heterogeneous <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> during slice generation, thereby enabling the production of voxel-matrices describing <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> for bitmap-printing at the 3 D printer's native voxel resolution. A bitmap-slicing framework designed to inform <b>material</b> property <b>distribution</b> in concert with slice generation is demonstrated. In contrast to existing approaches, this framework emphasizes the ability to integrate multiple geometry-based data sources to achieve high levels of control for applications {{in a wide variety of}} design scenarios.

40|$|A novel electrical-impedance {{tomography}} (EIT) diagnostic system, including {{hardware and}} software, {{has been developed}} and used to quantitatively measure <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> in multiphase flows within electrically-conducting (i. e., industrially relevant or metal) vessels. The EIT system consists of energizing and measuring electronics and seven ring electrodes, which are equally spaced on a thin nonconducting rod that is inserted into the vessel. The vessel wall is grounded and serves as the ground electrode. Voltage-distribution measurements are used to numerically reconstruct the time-averaged impedance distribution within the vessel, from which the <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> are inferred. Initial proof-of-concept and calibration was completed using a stationary solid-liquid mixture in a steel bench-top standpipe. The EIT system was then deployed in Sandia's pilot-scale slurry bubble-column reactor (SBCR) to measure <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> of gas-liquid two-phase flows over a range of column pressures and superficial gas flow rates. These two-phase quantitative measurements were validated against an established gamma-densitometry tomography (GDT) diagnostic system, demonstrating agreement to within 0. 05 volume fraction for most cases, with a maximum difference of 0. 15 volume fraction. Next, the EIT system was combined with the GDT system to measure <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> of gas-liquid-solid three-phase flows in Sandia's SBCR for two different solids loadings. Accuracy for the three-phase flow measurements {{is estimated to be}} within 0. 15 volume fraction. The stability of the energizing electronics, the effect of the rod on the surrounding flow field, and the unsteadiness of the liquid temperature all degrade measurement accuracy and need to be explored further. This work demonstrates that EIT may be used to perform quantitative measurements of <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> in multiphase flows in metal vessels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tomographic imaging of {{multi-phase}} <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> in in-dustrial processes can {{be based}} on different sensing modalities, e. g. ultrasound, electrical capacitance, or X-rays. Each of them is sensitive to specific properties of the materials to be imaged. The achievable image quality and resolution are limited in practice due to limited data and ill-posed inverse problems. For soft field modalities like electrical capacitance and resistance there are inherent lim-itations. To achieve a further improvement for the case of two-phase <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> we investigate the fusion of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) with ultrasound transmission tomography. The methods offer comple-mentary properties, making them well suited for data fusion. Sequential fusion is performed using the information from ultrasound tomography as input for ECT. A linear non-iterative algorithm and a nonlinear iterative algorithm are used for data fusion. The methods are validated using measurements of various gas-solids two-phase <b>material</b> <b>distributions.</b> The {{results show that the}} ultra-sound information only leads to minor improvements with the linear algorithm. However, the nonlinear algorithm can fruitfully exploit the available data and yields results exceeding the quality of the single-modality images. Key Words.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to model complex heterogeneous objects with simultaneous geometry intricacies as well as complex <b>material</b> <b>distributions.</b> Different from most of the existing approaches, which utilize manifold B-Rep and the assembly representations, the proposed scheme takes advantage of the non-manifold cellular representations to model the geometries of the heterogeneous objects. With the aid of the cell adjacency information and attribute based reasoning, complex, smooth and versatile <b>material</b> <b>distributions</b> can be defined upon the intricate geometries. Compared with other similar approaches, the proposed scheme (1) generates heterogeneous object models with higher data consistencies and lower redundancies; (2) naturally avoids unnecessary/repetitive computations and thus improves computation efficiencies; (3) represents versatile material variations/distributions using different heterogeneous feature tree (HFT) structures. The detailed representation, associated algorithms and a prototype software package are presented. Example heterogeneous objects modeled with the proposed approach are provided. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Heterogeneous object {{design is}} an active {{research}} area in recent years. The conventional CAD modeling approaches only provide geometry and topology of the object, but do not contain any information {{with regard to the}} materials of the object and so can not be used for the fabrication of heterogeneous objects (HO) through rapid prototyping.

40|$|Planning {{hazardous}} <b>materials</b> <b>distribution</b> routes for servicing a given set {{of orders}} within specified time windows {{is a problem}} frequently surfacing in a city logistics environment which is characterized by dynamic travel times. The hazardous <b>materials</b> <b>distribution</b> problem involves {{the determination of the}} sequence of deliveries and the corresponding paths assigned to each truck. This paper presents the formulation of the hazardous <b>materials</b> <b>distribution</b> problem as a bi-objective time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows. The paper presents the mathematical formulation of the problem as an integer network flow model with multiple objectives. The weighted-sum method is applied decomposing the bi-objective vehicle routing and scheduling problem to a series of single-objective instances of the problem, where the objective function is expressed by the weighted sum of the criteria under consideration. A route-building heuristic algorithm is presented for addressing each of the constituent single-objective problems, where stops are inserted iteratively in the front part of the unfinished route. A label-setting algorithm is integrated in the heuristic algorithm for solving the time-dependent shortest path problem with multiple intermediate stops arising after the insertion of any stop in the route. The proposed solution approach has been applied to a set of solvable test problems to assess the accuracy of the heuristic solutions. The results indicate a tolerable deviation of the heuristic solutions from the actual non-dominated solutions. In addition, the proposed algorithm was applied to a set of test problems resembling real-life problem cases. The average computational time needed for solving this type of test problems is not prohibitive...|$|R
