50|$|In 2006, a Spanish vessel on an {{exploratory}} trawl found commercial quantities of grenadiers (<b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.,</b> Coelorhynchus spp.) {{to the south}} and east of the Falkland Islands at depths between 750 and 830 m depths {{in the eastern part of}} FICZ. It has been estimated that this species needs a stock biomass of 40000 tonnes to produce a sustainable harvest of 3000 tonnes per annum and is now reflected as a separate entry in the tables below.|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic {{fish fauna}} from outer {{continental}} shelf/upper slope depths is under-sampled {{compared to that}} of the inner shelf, and there are limited quantitative data available on absolute abundance and taxonomic change with depth. A photographic survey of demersal fishes was conducted along a depth-gradient of 400 – 2099 m on the outer shelf and upper slope west of Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago. A total of 1490 fishes were identified at least to the family level. Notothenioids composed 52. 7 % of absolute abundance and non-notothenioids 47. 3 %. The most abundant families were Nototheniidae (39. 4 %), followed by Macrouridae (28. 9 %), Zoarcidae (16. 9 %), and Channichthyidae (12. 1 %). The most abundant species were the notothenioids Lepidonotothen squamifrons (30. 5 %) and Chionobathyscus dewitti (11. 7 %), and the non-notothenioid <b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.</b> (29. 5 %). The absolute abundance of all fishes peaked at 400 – 599 m. Depths of maximum abundance were 400 – 599 m for L. squamifrons, 700 – 1499 m for <b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.,</b> and 900 – 1499 for C. dewitti. At 700 – 999 m the abundance shifted from primarily notothenioids to the non-notothenioids <b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.</b> and zoarcids. Fishes of the outer shelf and upper slope are not provincialized like those of the inner shelf and are circum-Antarctic...|$|E
40|$|The {{scavenging}} megafauna of the South Georgia and Shag Rocks slope in the south-west Atlantic (625 - 15 19 m) {{were investigated}} using autonomous baited camera systems. Two surveys were conducted: {{the first in}} 1997 (13 deployments) used a conventional 35 mm stills camera with a 200 J flash, whilst the second in 2000 (1 5 deployments) used low-light digital video cameras. The scavenging community responded rapidly {{to the arrival of}} bait on the sea floor and was dominated by stone crabs (Lithodidae) and toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Stone crabs took up residence around the bait until it was consumed, with a maximum number of 108 in the field of view after four hours. The most frequently observed crab species was Paralomis formosa. Paralomis spinosissima, Neolithodes diomedea and Lithodes sp., were also observed. Toothfish were the most frequently observed scavenging fish and were seen during all but one deployment, typically making brief visits (1 - 2 min) to the bait, but appeared startled by the flash in the 1997 survey. Labriform swimming (sculling with the pectoral fins) was the principal form of locomotion in toothfish (0. 22 body lengths (BL) sec-I), but they were capable of more rapid sub-carangiform (using caudal trunk and fin) motion (3 BL sec-I) when startled. Other scavenging fish observed included the blue-hake Antimora rostrata, grenadiers (<b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.),</b> skates, liparids and zoarcids...|$|E
40|$|A. Status of the {{fisheries}} A total of 9 Spanish pelagic trawlers operated in NAFO Subarea 1 and 2, Div. 1 F and 2 J, during 2004, amounting 152 days of fishing effort, {{part of this}} effort was carried out within the ZEE of Greenland. Catches in Div. 1 F and 2 J were 885 tons of redfish (Sebastes mentella). Table 1 shows the effort and catches by quarter and Division of this fishery. More complete information about this fishery {{can be found in}} NAFO SCR Doc. 05 / 15. (B) Research studies An experimental fishing survey with three Spanish commercial vessels was carried out in Subarea 1, inside the territorial waters of Greenland, from July to December 2004. The observers on board collected data of catches by species, effort and position by haul and took length distribution samples of the main species in the catches (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Pandalus borealis, Gadus morhua, Hippoglossoides platessoides, Sebastes <b>spp,</b> <b>Macrourus</b> berglax and Polar cod). Biological sampling of Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Pandalus borealis, Gadus morhua, Hippoglossoides platessoides and Macrourus berglax were done. Otoliths of Greenland halibut and cod were also taken for age determination. During this experimental fishing 826 hauls of approximately one hour of duration were carried out in Subarea 1 with a bottom trawl gear (between 42 and 60 mm cod-end). The main catches were Greenland halibut (73 %), northern prawn (9 %) and cod (5 %). Table 2 shows the catches by species and Division and Table 3 presents the effort in hours by Division.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{history of}} biotic {{exploitation}} for the continental margin (shelf and slope) of the Antarctic Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is reviewed, {{with emphasis on}} the period from 1970 to 2010. In the Antarctic Peninsula portion, marine mammals were decimated by the 1970 s and groundfish by the early 1980 s. Fishing for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba began upon the demise of groundfish and now is the only fishing that remains in this region. Surveys show that cetacean and most groundfish stocks remain severely depressed, harvest of which is now prohibited by the International Whaling Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). On the other hand, krill fishing in this region is underway {{and in recent years}} has contributed up to 72 % of the Southern Ocean catch, depending on fishing conditions and the CCAMLR conservation measures in force. Elsewhere along the Antarctic continental margin, marine mammals were also severely depleted by the 1970 s, followed directly by relatively low-level fisheries for krill that continued until the early 1990 s. Recently in these areas, where fin-fishing is still allowed, fisheries for Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni have been initiated, with one of this fish’s main prey, grenadiers <b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.,</b> being taken significantly as by-catch. Continental margin fishing currently accounts for ∼ 25 % of the total toothfish catch of the Southern Ocean. Fishing along the Antarctic continental margin, especially the Antarctic Peninsula region, is a clear case of both the tragedy of the commons and ‘fishing down the food web’...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDepredation is a human–wildlife {{interaction}} over {{access to}} resources, which often includes {{a combination of}} socio-economic, ecological and conservation issues. However, estimating the amount of resource depredated can be especially challenging when depredation occurs on fish in the marine environment. This {{is the case for}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on the demersal Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fishery operating within the Crozet Islands EEZ (southern Indian Ocean). This study aimed at providing two indirect methods of assessment of depredated biomass over an 11 -year period (2003 to 2013), accounting for spatial variations of depredation levels. In the first method, fishing data from 6 525 longline sets were used to calculate the difference between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of non-depredated and depredated lines. When killer whales and sperm whales occurred separately, 575 ± 35 tonnes and 739 ± 87 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish respectively were estimated to be depredated by the two species. When the two species co-occurred around vessels, 1 679 ± 74 tonnes were depredated. The second method used the differences in the proportion of grenadiers (<b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.)</b> between non-depredated and depredated longline sets to estimate the number of depredated Patagonian toothfish. This approach, which can only be implemented when a sufficient level of by-catch species occurs, provides comparable results and thus strong support for the CPUE method. From these two methods, depredation rates were estimated to range from 27. 3 % to 29. 1 % of the total catch (landed and depredated), {{which is one of the}} highest among all similar situations where depredation is reported elsewhere in the world. In addition to providing a methodology that could be used in other areas with depredation issues, these findings emphasise the critical importance for fishery managers and researchers to account for depredation when assessing fish stocks, fishery economics and/or conservation of odontocetes...|$|E
40|$|Robust stock {{assessments}} and catch limits according to CCAMLR decision rules {{remain to be}} determined for Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2, and precautionary management arrangements are in place {{as set out in}} Conservation Measures 41 - 11 and 41 - 05. Multiple exploratory fishing research plans are currently in place by Australia (commenced 2015 / 16), France (commencing 2016 / 17), Japan (commencing 2016 / 17), Republic of Korea (commenced 2012 / 13) and Spain (commenced 2012 / 13). To facilitate progress towards stock assessment for Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2, WG-SAM- 16 welcomed plans for increased coordination between all proponents of research in these Divisions (WG-SAM- 16 para. 3. 12). Accordingly, a single consolidated research plan in being developed that outlines the collective research objectives and activities of Australia, France, Japan, Republic of Korea and Spain (hereafter referred to as the participating Members). This research plan has been submitted as a companion paper to WGFSA- 16. Separate reports on the progress of data collection and/or preliminary data analyses were presented by individual participating Members to WG-SAM- 16 (WG-SAM- 16 / 09; 16 / 01; 16 / 02; 16 / 04; 16 / 05; 16 / 17 and 16 / 10). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a summary of all exploratory fishing activities and the volume of data collected up to the 2015 / 16 season in Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2, and evaluate the collective progress towards stock assessments. A total of 897 research lines were completed over 10 fishing expeditions between 3 November 2011 and 14 April 2016. Total catches of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) were 894. 5 and 2. 3 tonnes, respectively. Macroscopic evaluation of maturity stage indicated that both immature and mature (gonad stage ≥ 3) D. mawsoni were present across all Research Blocks. The most commonly caught bycatch group was grenadiers (<b>Macrourus</b> <b>spp.),</b> followed by icefish (Channichthyidae), moray cods (Muraenolepis spp.) and violet cod (Antimora rostrata). Target and bycatch species were sampled for total length, whole weight, sex and gonad stage in accordance with Conservation Measure 41 - 01. A total of 4585 D. mawsoni and 49 D. eleginoides were tagged and released between 5 January 2008 and 20 March 2016, and 19 D. mawsoni were recaptured. The 2015 / 16 season also included the deployment of underwater video cameras by Australia, along with CTD recorders, to improve our understanding of toothfish habitat use along East Antarctica...|$|E
