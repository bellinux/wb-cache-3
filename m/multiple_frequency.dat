2500|$|Typically, guitar {{amplifiers}} {{have two}} amplifying circuit stages {{and in addition}} frequently have tone-shaping electric circuits, which usually include at least bass and treble controls, which function similarly to the equivalent controls on a home hi-fi system. More expensive amplifiers typically have more controls for other frequency ranges, such as one or two [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] control for high frequencies. Some guitar amplifiers have a graphic equalizer, which uses vertical faders to control <b>multiple</b> <b>frequency</b> bands. Some more expensive bass amps have a parametric equalizer, which enables precise control of tone.|$|E

The {{advantage}} is that <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be jammed simultaneously; however, the jamming effect can be limited because this requires the jammer to spread its full power between these frequencies, {{as the number of}} frequencies covered increases the less effectively each is jammed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} to realize a multifrequency Oscillator-type active printed monopole antenna. The concept of period doubling route to chaos is exploited to generate the <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The chaotic Colpitts oscillator is integrated with the printed monopole antenna (PMA) {{on the same side of}} the substrate to realize an Oscillator-type active antenna where the PMA acts as a load and radiator to the chaotic oscillator. By changing the bias voltage of the oscillator, the antenna can be made to operate at single or <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies.</b> To test the characteristics of the antenna at single and <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> of operation, two similar prototype models of printed monopole broadband antennas are developed. One of these antennas used at transmit side is fed by the chaotic Colpitts oscillator while the other is used as the receive antenna. It is observed that the antenna receives single or <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> simultaneously for particular values of the bias voltage of the oscillator at the transmit end...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a {{nonlinear}} microwave {{algorithm is}} considered. Using <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> allows for obtaining the improved resolution {{available at the}} higher frequencies while retaining the regularizing effects of the lower frequencies. However, {{a number of different}} challenges arise when using data from <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> for imaging of biological targets. In this paper, the performance of a multi-frequency algorithm, in which measurement data from several different frequencies are used at once, is compared with a stepped-frequency algorithm, in which images reconstructed at lower frequencies are used as starting guesses for reconstructions at higher frequencies. The performance is illustrated using simulated 2 -D data and data obtained with the 3 -D DTU microwave imaging system...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the signal path {{generally}} depends {{on the size of the}} system in place. [...] In smaller systems, the main outputs are often sent to an additional equalizer, or directly to a power amplifier, with one or more loudspeakers (typically two, one on each side of the stage in smaller venues, or a large number in big venues) that are connected to that amplifier. [...] In large-format systems, the signal is typically first routed through an equalizer then to a crossover. [...] A crossover splits the signal into <b>multiple</b> <b>frequency</b> bands with each band being sent to separate amplifiers and speaker enclosures for low, middle, and high-frequency signals. [...] Low-frequency signals are sent to amplifiers and then to subwoofers, and middle and high-frequency sounds are typically sent to amplifiers which power full-range speaker cabinets. Using a crossover to separate the sound into low, middle and high frequencies can lead to a [...] "cleaner", clearer sound (see bi-amplification) than routing all of the frequencies through a single full-range speaker system. Nevertheless, many small venues still use a single full-range speaker system, as it is easier to set up and less expensive.|$|E

50|$|The {{anti-radiation}} {{version of}} the YJ-91 missile was developed from the Kh-31P, which uses {{a wide array of}} seekers to cover the entire radar frequency band. The Chinese were not satisfied with the requirement to include multiple seekers and preferred to have a single seeker capable of covering <b>multiple</b> <b>frequency</b> bands, like the AGM-88 HARM. However, such ambitions proved to be too great for the Chinese microelectronics industry. They could not achieve the goal in a single step within the required timeline originally specified by the Chinese military. Instead, a two-step approach was implemented: The completion of the development of a single seeker covering <b>multiple</b> <b>frequency</b> bands was pushed back, while a stopgap measure was adopted in the meantime. The Kh-31P was modified so that the seekers could be rapidly changed in the forward airstrips (providing the specialized tooling is available), so that missile would not need to be sent back to depots or factories to perform such operation.|$|E

The result is wire-like reliability in a network built from unreliable wireless links. Yet, the impact of using <b>multiple</b> <b>frequencies</b> on the {{medium access control}} layer is still not perfectly understood, and virtually all channel hopping solutions use "blind" channel hopping, i. e., hopping over all frequencies equivalently.
