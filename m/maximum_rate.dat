40|$|The firm should pursue both <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> {{on capital}} and <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on equity simultaneously. <b>Maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on capital {{is the primary}} goal for firms because <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on capital {{guarantees}} efficiency. Therefore, maximum profit, maximum {{market value of the}} firm, maximum value of equity and <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on equity are inappropriate to be the primary goal. Since gross profit is independent of capital structure, capital structure just distributes return on capital into equity and debt (i. e., <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on equity determines capital structure). The <b>maximum</b> return <b>rate</b> on equity is the secondary goal that the firm pursues. Leverage makes the return rate on equity be higher than interest rate.

Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time.
