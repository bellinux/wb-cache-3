40|$|The {{standing}} crop of benthic and planktonic algae in the Moruya River, Australia, was, in general, low compared with values given for northern hemisphere rivers. Diatoms always {{accounted for more}} than 90 % of the algae on the sediments with the most common species being typical of holarctic flora. The relative abundance of each of six predominant taxa was similar at the three sampling localities and did not show marked seasonal variation. However, Gomphonema spp. contributed a relatively greater number in the downstream area whereas Cocconeis placentula E hr. was comparatively more abundant upstream. The highest {{standing crop}} (1. 47 × 106 cells/cm 2) was found downstream and in the calmest part of the river between January and March, coincident with maximum water temperatures. A true phytoplankton succession comprising filamentous chlorophytes, Scenedesmus, Melosira varians A g., Dactylococcopsis, Eudorina and Merismopedia was observed at the most downstream site during the spring and summer, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of 126. 7 × 103 cells/litre being attained in December. The gut of larval lampreys > 100 mm contained large numbers (44, 000 - 525, 000 cells) of algae. Scenedesmus and Dactylococcopsis occurred much more frequently in the gut than in either the sediment or water, but the reverse was true for filamentous algae...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that lower rates of granivory in South American warm deserts compared to their North American counterparts arose from a reduction of seed reserves in the former owing to the extinction of argyrolagid marsupials. We measured seed reserves in two habitats of the central Monte Desert in an attempt to detect such seed decline, but to no avail. After moderate rainfall, <b>maximum</b> seed <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> reached 16, 000 and 23, 000 seeds m – 2 in shrublands and open forests, respectively. Under the canopy of trees and shrubs there were 19, 000 and 37, 000 seeds m – 2; whereas in exposed areas there were c. 10, 000 seeds m – 2 in both habitats. Seed banks in other South American semi-arid areas showed similar values. Total grass seeds as well as those presumably preferred by ants also seem to be similar in both continents. Hence, granivory in South America, as has been already reported for Australia, is lower than in North America in spite of the great similarity of seed bank sizes. Moreover, argyrolagids were unlikely seed-hoarding granivores, therefore some other reason than argyrolagid extinction should be sought to explain the lack of specialized seed-eating mammals, and the smaller overall seed consumption rates in South American deserts...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{relationships between}} plant productivity and annual fluxes of nitrogen and nitrous oxide in a tallgrass prairie landscape in central Kansas. Our {{objective was to}} develop predictive relationships between these variables {{that could be used}} in conjunction with remote sensing information on plant produc- tivity to produce large-area estimates of N gas fluxes. Our hypothesis was that there are inherent relationships between plant productivity and N gas fluxes in tallgrass prairie because both are controlled by water and N availability. The research was carried out as part of a multi-investigator project, the First ISLSCP Field Ex- periment (FIFE, ISLSCP = International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Program), directed toward the use of remote sensing to characterize land-atmosphere interactions. Fluxes of N, (denitrification) and were measured using soil core techniques. Estimates of annual flux were produced by temporal extrapolation of measured rates. Annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated from measurements of the <b>maximum</b> <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of plant biomass. There were strong relationships between ANPP and N gas fluxes, and between a satellite remote sensing-basedindex of plant productivity (normalized difference vege- tation index, NDVI) and gas fluxes. We used these relationships to convert images of NDVI into images of N gas fluxes for one 83 ha watershed and for the entire 15 by 15 km FIFE site. These images were used to compute mean landscape gas fluxes (0. 62 g N for 0. 66 g N for and total N gas production forthe two areas.

40|$|Two {{surveys of}} the water {{chemistry}} and photosynthetic flora were carried out in England, for waters with a pH of 3. 0 or less. Of the 16 sites located, fourteen were associated with coal mining, one with a barytes mine and one with an industrial effluent. One coal mining site (Site 16) and the industrial effluent (Site 15), were found to run intermittently below pH 3. 0. Samples collected from 95 10 m reaches, showed that the waters were characterized by high levels of heavy metals, silicate and sulphate and that most carried moderately large levels of phosphate and combined inorganic nitrogen. The total flora from the 16 sites consisted of 24 algal species, two mosses and two flowering plants. Of the 8 species which occurred in over 20 % of the roaches sampled, Euglena mutabilis was the most widespread and abundant species. One stream with a pH gradient of 2. 6 - 7. 0 (Brandon Pithouse Acid Stream) was studied in greater detail. Observations were made in respect to seasonal variation and to changes in chemistry and flora along the pH gradient. In addition, monthly estimations of the <b>maximum</b> <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of algae and moss protonema were carried out for one year. Analysis of these data suggests that over a large pH range, H+ concentration has the greatest influence {{on the number of}} species present in the stream; although other factors (eg. precipitation of ferric hydroxide) may also affect the presence and abundance of some algae. in addition to field studies, laboratory experiments were conducted on five species of algae isolated from Brandon Pithouse Acid Stream.

40|$|In October-November 1975 {{the mean}} rate of {{integral}} prima *y production in Lake Tangan-yika was 1. 4 g C. n- 2. d- 1 (for cloudless weather). The rang:e of values for daily integral primary production observed {{at this time}} of year over the whclle lake could occur at a single station in the course of a day. Small-scale spatial variability WLS equally extreme. Thcrc was no consistent pattern of diurnal variation. The mean annual d,lily rntc of primary production for the lake was estimated to be 1 g C * rnd 2 * d ‘, assuming clc udless weather. Because phy-toplankton biomass was low in October-November the rates of primary production observed imply very high algal growth rates, ranging from 0. 1 to 3. 0. d- ’ with a mean of 0. 9. This mean rate and the range of growth rates are the highest so far known for tropical akes. High growth rates combined with persistently low algal biomass require tl-at loss rates be high also. The high fish production of the lake requires either very high trophic efficiency based on the measured pelagic primary production or an additional source of energy derived from the pcrcninlly anoxic deep water. Melack (1980) made the first direct measurement, 0. 5 g C. rnp 2. d-l, of pelagic primary production in Lake Tanganyika at a single station in the northern part of the lake during April 1971. Although the pelagic region of the lake has been char-acterized as oligotrophic (Beauchamp 1939; Coulter 1963), this estimate of pri-mary production would be high for large temperate lakes (Vollcnweider et al. 1974). However, the extrapolation of Me-lack’s single measurement in space and time over Lake Tanganyika’s 33, 000 km 2 adds a great deal of uncertainty. We have attempted to improve the precision of the estimate by conducting two surveys over the whole pelagic region of the lake dur-ing periods of minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> We have used our esti-mates to examine the trophic efficiency of the lake especially with respect to fish production...|$|E

40|$|Predicting {{diversity}} {{is a central}} theme of ecology. In this thesis, two aspects of diversity were explored, number of vegetation types and species richness. In the first chapter, I {{examined the relationship between}} number of vegetation types and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in wetlands. Fifteen individually homogeneous wetland sites which represented a broad <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> gradient were sampled in eastern Canada. There appears to be an inverse relationship between number of vegetation types and <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> In chapter 2, I investigated the relationship between species richness and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> at two levels of organization: the among vegetation types level and the within vegetation type level. The results indicated that the model of species richness proposed by Grime had predictive power at a coarse-grained level of organization, among vegetation types, but did not survive the transition to a finer-grained level of organization, the within vegetation type level. Therefore, the higher level processes which structure species richness patterns among vegetation types are not the same processes that determine richness patterns within a vegetation type. Numerous forces, abiotic or biotic, can maintain or alter vegetation states and species richness at different levels of organization. In the third chapter, I tested whether these "assembly forces" had the potential to duplicate the patterns observed in chapters 1 and 2 in a large microcosm experiment. Chapter 4 investigated the effects of a disturbance involving the complete removal of above ground vegetation in five wetlands of varying <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> found on the Ottawa River. The results indicated that the wetland <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> gradient and the diversity patterns observed along this gradient were likely the result of an underlying natural disturbance gradient. In chapter 5, I considered the results from chapters 1 to 4 with regards to the conservation value, potential threats, and proper management techniques for wetlands, particularly for low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands. In addition to the fifteen wetlands surveyed in chapter 1, additional low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetland sites from the Georgian Bay area in Ontario and the Tusket River Valley in Nova Scotia were surveyed. The results revealed that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands had many more nationally rare species than did high <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands, in addition to the higher species richness and higher number of vegetation types discussed above. The results of the microcosm experiment revealed that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands may be severely threatened by eutrophication and by an invasive Eurasian weed, Lythrum salicaria. In each of the five wetland sites examined in the field experiment, L. salicaria exhibited dramatic increases in abundance over the three year observation period. Further, the disturbance treatment at each site did not slow the invasion of L. salicaria, but instead increased the rate of invasion in at least one site. I conclude that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands, despite their high conservation value, are severely threatened and must be protected from the effects of eutrophication and invasion by Lythrum salicaria.

Species that concentrated around the standing timber included sunfishes (Lepomis pp.), crappies (Pomoxis pp.), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), buf-faloes (Ictiobus pp.), river carpsucker (Carpiodes carpio), and largemouth bass (Micropterus al-moides). Three open-water species, white bass (Morone chrysops), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepe-dianurn), and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), showed little attraction to areas containing <b>standing</b> timber. <b>Standing</b> <b>crop</b> estimates of minnows (Cyprinidae) were nearly the same in wooded and nonwooded coves. Timber left standing in the basins of impound-ments can have positive effects on reproductive success, food organisms, <b>standing</b> <b>crop,</b> and har-vest of fishes (Ploskey 1981). From a fisheries management viewpoint, underwater structures have proven useful for concentrating many sport-fish species for anglers. For example, Pierce and Hooper (1980) found higher <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), bluegill (Le-pomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropter-us salmoides), and white crappie (Pomoxis an...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> in flowers {{within an}} {{individual}} plant are often highly variable. This variability {{may be a}} by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to pro-duce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar pro-duction rates were highly variable (CV = 1. 48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> were even more variable (CV = 2. 16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops,</b> increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> and pro-duction rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Fine {{roots are}} a dynamic {{component}} of Douglas-fir ecosystems. Changes in <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> indicate that fine roots require {{a major portion}} of the stand's energy resources to fulfill their role in the functioning of these systems. We observed <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of live and dead fine (< 1 mm diameter) and small (1 - 5 mm diameter) roots over a 30 -month period based on intact soil core samples taken monthly from grids established in dry, moderate, and wet stands of mature Douglas-fir. Environmental measurements included temperature of soil and air, water potential of soil and xylem at predawn, and potential evaporation. Changes in <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of live and dead fine roots in the top 75 cm of soil indicate that seasonal patterns vary from one year to next and can vary by site, but may not. Differences from one year to the next may be greater than differences between sites. Large changes in <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> can occur within a few months.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Standing</b> <b>crop</b> in 204 grab and diver-operated airlift {{samples taken}} in Lancaster Sound, Eclipse Sound, and {{northern}} and central B a f h Bay at depths of 5 - 1088 m was highest between 15 and 105 m. <b>Standing</b> <b>crop</b> was highest in Lancaster Sound and least in central Baffh Bay. Three species assemblages derived by factor analysis bore some similarities to communities described by other workers. Depth and location were better predictors of community composition and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> than were depth and substrate. The {{narrow range of}} grain size found in any one depth range probably accounts for the relative lack of substrate effect on <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and community composition. Differences among areas are probably related to food availability. High <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and communities including filter feeders may be maintained to considerable depths in Lancaster Sound by high current speeds and possible high primary productivity. Currents are weaker and biomass lower in northern Baffin Bay than in Lancaster Sound. The weakest currents were found in Eclipse Sound and central Baffin Bay; deposit feeders and low biomass characterized depths> 25 m in both areas.

40|$|I used a field {{experiment}} to measure total competition intensity and its above- and below-ground components in two wetlands that represent extremes in habitat productivity: an infertile sandy shoreline and a fertile bay. Transplants of Lythrum salicaria and Carex crinita were grown with no neighbours, with roots of neighbours only {{and with all}} neighbours; their growth rates were used to estimate competition intensity. The experiment was carried out {{to answer the following}} main questions: (1) Is there a difference in total, above- and below-ground competition intensity in two wetlands that differ in <b>standing</b> <b>crop?</b> (2) Is there an effect of <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> on total, above- and below-ground competition intensity when the data from the two wetlands are combined? Both total and above-ground competition intensity were found to be greater in the high <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetland but below-ground competition did not differ between wetlands (CITOTAL: p 0. 00001, CIABOVE: p = 0. 0013 CIBELOW: p = 0. 58). Mean total competition increased from 0. 16 to 0. 43, the above-ground component increased from - 0. 063 to 0. 21 and the below-ground component was close to 0. 20 in both wetlands. Total and above-ground competition intensity was significantly affected by <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in the wetlands studied but below-ground competition intensity was not (CITOTAL: p = 0. 0001, CIABOVE: p = 0. 0001, CIBELOW: p = 0. 89). The result that competition was predominantly below-ground in the low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetland supports previous work in agricultural pot experiments (Wilson 1988) and terrestrial field studies (Wilson and Tilman 1991, Putz and Canham 1992, Wilson and Tilman 1993, Wilson in press). The result that root and shoot competition were roughly equal in the high <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetland is not typical of past studies. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an aggregative {{response}} of Dark-bellied Brent geese to increased {{productivity of the}} vegetation {{during the growing season}} on agricultural fields on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. Plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> was found to be maintained at low levels in the fields where geese activity focussed, whereas the remainder of the fields escaped herbivore control and developed a high <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> This pattern can be explained by a decreased efficiency of grazing in vegetation with a high <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> In other words, the functional response of the geese is not monotonically increasing but dome-shaped. As a consequence, continuously grazed swards are more suitable for feeding than temporarily ungrazed swards. We present a model showing that, for a dome-shaped functional response, optimal foraging under increasing primary productivity leads to spatial heterogeneity in <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Beyond a certain threshold value, a further increase in productivity leads to a progressive release of vegetation from herbivore control and {{to the development of a}} high <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Interestingly, our model suggests that only in a stable and predictable environment the aggregative behaviour of herbivores is able to maintain the intake rate close to its potential maximum. Misjudgement of patch quality by the herbivore or any other process disrupting the match between local primary production and consumption leads to a less than optimal intake, as suitable vegetation becomes depleted. This has important implications for ecological inferences, such as the prediction of carrying capacities in herbivore-dominated ecosystems. ...|$|R
40|$|Converted to {{electronic}} format by Damon J. Gomez (NOAA/RSMAS) in 2002. Copy {{available at the}} NOAA Miami Regional Library. Minor editorial changes were made. ] The distribution and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of benthic algal species on a Caribbean algal ridge (St. Croix) and its associated carbonate pavements is discussed and contrasted with that of other eastern Caribbean algal ridges and a Pacific algal ridge. Mean <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of 3 kg/m 2 (wet weight) and a species richness of about 40 species (for ten 0. 25 m 2 samples) were encountered on St. Croix. Non-calcified or fleshy algae are greatly reduced in <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> with depth away from the high wave energy ridge crests and species richness increases. This is correlated with the greater grazing abilities of fish and invertebrates under less turbulent conditions. On reefs of typical lower eastern Caribbean islands, only where the force of water movement across intertidal algal ridges prevents intense grazing by fish and echinoids are general high levels of algal <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and productivity developed. However, in the more eutrophic waters of higher islands and where wave action is greater, dense <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of larger fleshy algae can also extend sublittorally to depths of at least 10 meters. We suggest that the extensive filling of grazing niches in tropical reefs and a general retreat of plant tissues to protective carbonate structures has caused a reduction of primary productivity in typical reef environments...|$|R

Mean weight of bass was generally greatest in polytypic ponds, but <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> there were lower {{in one of the}} years owing to greater mortality. During one of the years, all three basses ate a wider variety of foods when stocked polytypically, although the total amount of food eaten did not vary. Two strain-specific differences appeared to be independent of the stocking combination: (a) survival of Florida largemouth bass was lower than that of northern largemouth bass, and (b) average weight, survival, <b>standing</b> <b>crop,</b> and diversity of diet were lower for spotted bass than for either subspecies of largemouth bass. Judging by total <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> in the ponds, stocking of spotted bass appeared to be most promising for augmenting native populations of northern largemouth bass...|$|R
