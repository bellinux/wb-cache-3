40|$|An {{efficient}} {{approach for}} face compression is introduced. Restricting {{a family of}} images to frontal facial <b>mug-shots</b> enables us to first geometrically deform a given face into a canonical form in which the same facial features are mapped to the same spatial locations. Next, we break the image into tiles and model each image tile in a compact manner. Modeling the tile content relies on clustering the same tile location at many training images. A tree of vector-quantization dictionaries is constructed per location, and lossy compression is achieved using bit-allocation according to the significance of a tile. Repeating this modeling/coding scheme over several scales, the resulting multi-scale algorithm is demonstrated to compress facial images at very low bit rates while keeping high visual qualities, outperforming JPEG- 2000 performance significantly...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{researched}} various methods {{leading to}} {{recognition of a}} person's face by ways of statistical and mathematical analysis and comparisons of facial features {{to that of a}} known person. Many approaches to overcome inherent face recognition challenges have been developed over the years. One of the most accurate and rapid ways to identify faces is to use what is called the eigenface [1] technique, that was created as a linear combination model using the mathematical software called MatLab. The linear combination model has been recognized for several years and uses the process of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). This system was able to successfully recognize all randomly generated photos (<b>mug-shots)</b> with 97. 7 percent accuracy using 21 eigenfaces. The eigenface technique uses a highly effective combination of linear algebra and statistical analysis (PCA) to generate an identifying set of base faces, the eigenfaces, against which the inputs are tested and matched. Although using a sophisticated statistical model is a means to recognize a person by facial patterns, it is also critically important to ac-knowledge that the collected data is imperfect and requires some manipulation to be both clean and normalized. The objective is to represent a face as a linear combination of images from our data base. Recently, Random Projection (RP) has emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction. In this paper, I will compare and contrast Random Projection (RP) with PCA using a well known face database. The experimental results illustrate that although PCA represents faces in a low-dimensional subspace, the overall performance is comparable to that of Random Projection, having higher computational requirements and being data dependent...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{accurate}} {{historians have}} sufficiently exposed, photographic techniques {{were more than}} often improved by (or for) Scientific Police, which, in turn, based and built its “scientific value” on the photographic ability to describe and measure man’s physiognomy, consequently provoking the nearly permanent faith in the self-sufficient evidentiary and objective character of photography, which also popularized the medium. If photography {{was defined as the}} first apparatus who could express, retain and fix the human trace (Walter Benjamin referring to Bertillon’s invention of ‘metric’ photography), and it’s still considered as the medium capable “to certify the human presence” (Barthes, Camera Lucida), in visual criminology photographs and <b>mug-shots</b> represent indeed an expressions of the self, by some means becoming extorted confessions, or uncontrolled self-revelatory forms. In our peculiar epoch, where photographs are more and more entrusted with the task of furthering and expanding the self, we would therefore like to question photography as “self-confession”, by analyzing the work of some artists whose starting point is the mistrusting of images. I intend to evocate some paradigmatic examples, The Innocents (2003) of the American photographer Taryn Simon in particular. Strongly supporting The Innocence Project (which discloses “disturbing fissures” in the US criminal justice system, such as incentivized informants, improper forensic science, procedural errors, government misconduct, false confessions and inadequate defense, finally denouncing eyewitness misidentification as “the greatest contributing factor to wrongful convictions”), the Simon’s photographic project displays in texts and images the true stories of some victims of wrongful conviction. The portraiture formula of Simon’s photographs brings to light the problematical relationship between photographic truth and photographic fiction, that the author highlight by showing the pseudo-evidence not merely involved in photo array procedures, sketches, live lineups and rogue’s galleries, but in every single portrait, in every mise en scène of a “guilty person”...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the history of {{photography}} to examine how criminal and medical science has depicted bodies deemed deviant, {{and the ways in which}} queer bodies have been variously categorised and marginalised. I take two contemporary case studies as a way to address this complex and contradictory history, focusing on two major themes: photography as an apparatus of power, and queerness as continuously in flux and unstable. Contemporary photographers Charlotte Haslund-Christensen and JJ Levine respond to this history by subverting the relationship between photographer and subject, creating alternative visualisations of queer identities. Haslund-Christensen’s WHO’S NEXT? features forty-two photographs mimicking the visual composition of criminal <b>mug-shots</b> [...] Levine’s Queer Portraits, taken over nine years from 2006 to 2015, focuses on queer-identified individuals within the domestic sphere. Both series respond to the marginalisation of LGBTQ people in photographic history while staking out very different territory: WHO’S NEXT?, arguing against complacency in the face of potential state violence; and, Queer Portraits, depicting alternative queer existences and social spaces. This thesis is divided into two parts, the first focusing on the history of photography and its use in categorising and documenting deviancy. In this, I argue that the camera as an apparatus of power produces the deviant bodies it claims to document. In searching for non-normative sexualities one must, as Dana Seitler notes, be attentive to both the absences in the visual record and archives that may not immediately be understood as queer. In part two, I focus on contemporary queer theory, in particular its political bent towards leftist, anti-capitalist politics. Here I question how the normalisation of LGBTQ individuals in western neoliberal states has been positioned as politically regressive versus queer activism, which advocates for alternative forms of social and political relationships framed outside of heteropatriarchy...|$|R

Moreover, many FR systems only match high quality faces captured in video, which further reduces the probability of detecting target individuals. Instead of matching faces captured through segmentation to reference stills, this paper exploits Adaptive Appearance Model Tracking (AAMT) to gradually learn a track-face-model for each individual appearing in the scene. The Sequential Karhunen– Loeve technique is used for online learning of these track-face-models within a particle filter-based face tracker. Meanwhile, these models are matched over successive frames against the reference still images of each target individual enrolled to the system, and then matching scores are accumulated over several frames for robust spatiotemporal recognition. A target individual is recognized if scores accumulated for a trackface-model over a fixed time surpass some decision threshold. The main advantage of AAMT over traditional still-to-video FR systems is the greater diversity of facial representation that may be captured during operations, and {{this can lead to}} better discrimination for spatiotemporal recognition. Compared to state-ofthe-art adaptive biometric systems, the proposed method selects facial captures to update an individual's face model more reliably because it relies on information from tracking. Simulation results obtained with the Chokepoint video dataset indicate that the proposed method provides a significantly higher level of performance compared state-of-the-art systems when a single reference still per individual is available for matching. This higher level of performance is achieved when the diverse facial appearances that are captured in video through AAMT correspond to that of reference stills...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} large scale, unconstrained, {{open set}} face recognition, which exhibits {{the properties of}} opera-tional face recognition scenarios. Most of the existing face recognition databases have been designed under controlled conditions or have been constructed from the images col-lected from the web. Face images collected from the web are less constrained than a <b>mug-shot</b> like collection. How-ever, they lack information about the imaging conditions and have no operational paradigm. In either case, most of the databases and evaluation algorithms have taken the form of ”closed set ” recognition, in which all testing classes {{are assumed to be}} known at training time. A more realistic scenario in face recognition is an ”open set, ” where lim-ited knowledge is available at training time and unknown classes can be present at test time. The database we provide supports the open set paradigm, which more closely mimics actual usage than classic closed set testing. The database also exhibits the natural variability among the face images such as pose, illumination, scale, expressions, occlusion, etc. Our goal is to provide around 100, 000 images of more than 1, 000 people.

40|$|As {{detection}} domains {{increase in}} size and complexity, new techniques are needed to effectively search the image and feature space. In this thesis, I explore one such approach to object recognition {{in the domain of}} face detection. This approach, dubbed compound templates, is compared to a single template approach. The developed system, Facets, provides an implementation of both techniques to enable fair comparison. The compound template technique uses subfeatures and spatial models to represent a compound object (such as a face). From these compound models, hypothesis-based search then combines top-down and bottom-up search processes to localize the search within the image and feature space. Detected subfeatures become evidence for facial hypotheses, which then guide local searches for the remaining subfeatures based upon the expected facial configuration. The compound technique is described and a comparison of the compound templates technique with a single template technique in a <b>mug-shot</b> style face domain is presented. A description of the implementation, along with issues surrounding the compound templates approach is also provided. Attention is paid to performance, including both efficiency and accuracy. The results are complex; but the strengths, weaknesses, and various trade-offs of the two techniques are detailed. The combined bottom-up and top-down approach of compound templates demonstrates a clear advantage over bottom-up only approaches. The compound templates approach also demonstrates better performance for feature sparse images, detection accuracy, domain coverage, and for domains with increasing size. iii Table of Contents Preliminaries Abstract.................................................... i [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Social mobilization, {{the ability}} to {{mobilize}} {{large numbers of people}} via social networks to achieve highly distributed tasks, has received significant attention in recent times. This growing capability, facilitated by modern communication technology, is highly relevant to endeavors which require the search for individuals that posses rare information or skill, such as finding medical doctors during disasters, or searching for missing people. An open question remains, as to whether in time-critical situations, people are able to recruit in a targeted manner, or whether they resort to so-called blind search, recruiting as many acquaintances as possible via broadcast communication. To explore this question, we examine data from our recent success in the U. S. State Department's Tag Challenge, which required locating and photographing 5 target persons in 5 different cities in the United States and Europe in less than 12 hours, based only on a single <b>mug-shot.</b> We find that people are able to consistently route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time pressure. We derive an analytical model for global mobilization and use it to quantify the extent to which people were targeting others during recruitment. Our model estimates that approximately 1 in 3 messages were of targeted fashion during the most time-sensitive period of the challenge. This is a novel observation at such short temporal scales, and calls for opportunities for devising viral incentive schemes that provide distance- or time-sensitive rewards to approach the target geography more rapidly, with applications in multiple areas from emergency preparedness, to political mobilization.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{real-world}} Still-to-Video (S 2 V) face recognition scenario, where only very few (single, in many cases) still images per person are enrolled into the gallery {{while it is}} usually possible to capture one or multiple video clips as probe. Typical application of S 2 V is <b>mug-shot</b> based watch list screening. Generally, in this scenario, the still image(s) were collected under controlled environment, thus of high quality and resolution, in frontal view, with normal lighting and neutral expression. On the contrary, the testing video frames are of low resolution and low quality, possibly with blur, and captured under poor lighting, in non-frontal view. We reveal that the S 2 V face recognition has been heavily overlooked in the past. Therefore, we provide a bench-marking {{in terms of both}} a large scale dataset and a new solution to the problem. Specifically, we collect (and release) a new dataset named COX-S 2 V, which contains 1, 000 subjects, with each subject a high qual-ity photo and four video clips captured simulating video surveillance sce-nario. Together with the database, a clear evaluation protocol is designed for benchmarking. In addition, in addressing this problem, we further propose a novel method named Partial and Local Linear Discriminant Analysis (PaLo-LDA). We then evaluated the method on COX-S 2 V and compared with several classic methods including LDA, LPP, ScSR. Eval-uation results not only show the grand challenges of the COX-S 2 V, but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed PaLo-LDA method over the competitive methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this work, {{we present}} novel warping {{algorithms}} for full 2 D pixel-grid deformations for face recognition. Due to high variation in face appearance, face recognition {{is considered a}} very difficult task, especially if only a single reference image, for example a <b>mug-shot,</b> per face is available. Usually model-based approaches with additional training data are used to cope with several types of variation occurring in facial imaging. Image warping contrarily yields a distance measure which is invariant with regard to several types of variation. This allows for precise recognition even using only very few reference observations. Due to the computationally complex problem of optimal 2 D warping, pseudo- 2 D warpingbased approaches in the past represented strong approximations of the original problem, and were mainly successful on data with low variability or rectified images. We propose a novel 2 D warping method which is globally optimal and makes no prior assumtions on the data variability besides two-dimensional smootheness constraints which both avoid local mirroring and gaps and significantly speed up the optimization. Furthermore, we show that occlusion handling is imperative to obtain smooth warpings {{in a variety of}} domains. We evaluate our novel algorithm on various well known databases, such as the AR-Face and CMU-PIE database, and provide a detailed comparison to existing warping approaches. We show that by using simple relative 2 D constraints, strong local features and a kernel, which is robust w. r. t. occlusions, our computationally complex approaches outperform state-ofthe-art results for recognizing faces under varying expressions, occlusions and poses. Most interestingly, we achieve higher accuracy using fewer training instances per class compared to methods learning a model of the 3 D shape. I...|$|E
