However, this arrangement <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament.

Joseph's corpse is taken to a castle where he is experimented on by Julian who is attempting discover the secret for eternal life. Later, Lorette meets a blind man in the street who asks her to drop off a letter. On dropping the letter off, she is kidnapped and finds herself locked in a bedroom with the skeletons of the Vampire's previous victims. As the police try and track down Lorette's kidnappers, Lantin is reassigned from following the Vampire story and is set to cover a ball at the castle of Du Grand. At the castle, he meets Gisele (Gianna Maria Canale) who expresses admiration for Lantin as he reminds her of his father. Lantin leaves the party and is pursued by the photographer Donald. Lantin states {{he does not want to}} lead on Gisele with her emotions which leads to Donald re-entering the castle to profess his love for Gisele. Gisele turns him down as her face begins to grow old before his eyes as she reveals that each person killed restores her youth for a short time. Knowing her secret, she reaches for a pistol and murders Donald. Gisele then calls upon Professor Julian to make her eternally young. Julian states that under her fragile emotional state it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work,</b> but begins an experimental transfer Lorette's youth and beauty to Giselle.|$|E
5|$|The fission-survived isotope 298Fl, long {{expected}} to be doubly magic, is predicted to have alpha decay half-life around 17 days. The direct synthesis of the nucleus 298Fl by a fusion–evaporation pathway is currently impossible since no known combination of target and stable projectile can provide 184 neutrons in the compound nucleus, and radioactive projectiles such as calcium-50 (half-life fourteenseconds) cannot yet {{be used in the}} needed quantity and intensity. Currently, one possibility for the synthesis of the expected long-lived nuclei of copernicium (291Cn and 293Cn) and flerovium near the middle of the island include using even heavier targets such as curium-250, berkelium-249, californium-251, and einsteinium-254, that when fused with calcium-48 would produce nuclei such as 291Mc and 291Fl (as decay products of 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv), with just enough neutrons to alpha decay to nuclides close enough to the centre of the island to possibly undergo electron capture and move inwards to the centre, though the cross sections would be small and little is yet known about the decay properties of superheavy nuclides near the beta stability line. This may be the best hope currently to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability, but it is speculative and may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> in practice. Another possibility is to use controlled nuclear explosions to achieve the high neutron flux necessary to create macroscopic amounts of such isotopes. This would mimic the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability after polonium bypassed, as it would bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108). Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E

25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis thus far is prevention.|$|E

25|$|If the {{sequence}} of the nucleotides in a gene changes, {{the sequence}} of the amino acids in the protein it produces may also change—if part of a gene is deleted, the protein produced is shorter and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> any more. This {{is the reason why}} different alleles of a gene can have different effects in an organism. As an example, hair color depends on how much of a dark substance called melanin is put into the hair as it grows. If a person has a normal set of the genes involved in making melanin, they make all the proteins needed and they grow dark hair. However, if the alleles for a particular protein have different sequences and produce proteins that can't do their jobs, no melanin is produced and the person has white skin and hair (albinism).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the nuances of the term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E
