5000|$|Flannel may be brushed {{to create}} extra {{softness}} or remain unbrushed. Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> rubs the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns {{to form a}} nap. Typically, flannel has a nap on either one side or both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.|$|E

A special instrument called a T-tap {{is used to}} clean out the stud holes before the stud is screwed in, or {{it can be used to}} re-tap the stud hole if the threads are damaged. Additionally, a small <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> can be used to help clean threads which are especially dirty. A wrench is used to tighten or loosen the studs.|$|E
5000|$|Key cutting (after cutting, the {{metalworking}} {{term for}} [...] "shaping by removing material") {{is the primary}} method of key duplication: a flat key is fitted into a vise in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise, and the original key is moved along a guide, while the blank is moved against a wheel, which cuts it. After cutting, the new key is deburred: scrubbed with a <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> to remove burrs, small pieces of metal remaining on the key, which, were they not removed, would be dangerously sharp and, further, foul locks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brushed</b> <b>metal</b> was criticised by user {{interface}} purists, who {{pointed out that}} Apple frequently violates its own rules {{for the use of}} the <b>brushed</b> <b>metal</b> look. The most notable of the supposed violations are Safari, Apple's web browser, and the Macintosh Finder itself. With the release of Mac OS X v10.3, Apple further expanded its list of acceptable uses for <b>brushed</b> <b>metal</b> to include windows that navigate lists of information. This expanded definition includes the Finder, but Safari's use of <b>brushed</b> <b>metal</b> remains a mystery. Opponents of the theory point out that even Apple's guidelines for the use of <b>brushed</b> <b>metal</b> are inconsistent, and that the motivation behind the alternative appearance's existence is unclear.|$|R

50|$|This {{mechanism}} is intended {{as an alternative}} to the usual method of supplying electric power to a rotating device, the use of slip rings. The slip rings are attached to one part of the machine, and a set of fine <b>metal</b> <b>brushes</b> are attached to the other part. The brushes are kept in sliding contact with the slip rings, providing an electrical path between the two parts while allowing the parts to rotate about each other.|$|R
50|$|Cards are {{normally}} {{passed through the}} sorter face down with the bottom edge ("9-edge") first. A small <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> or optical sensor is positioned so that, as each card goes through the sorter, one column passes under the brush or optical sensor. The holes sensed in that column together with the settings of the sorter controls determine which pocket the card is to be directed to. This directing is done by slipping the card into a stack of metal strips (or chute blades) that run {{the length of the}} sorter feed mechanism. Each blade ends above one of the output pockets, and the card is thus routed to the designated pocket.|$|E
40|$|EP 1829986 A 1 UPAB: 20071008 NOVELTY - In {{a process}} to polish a hard carbon surface that is bonded with a {{substrate}} material, the surface is polished by a <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> or plate (4) attached to a rotating spindle (3), and simultaneously advancing along the surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The speed at which the <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> or plate advances is set and regulated at more than 1 m/s, as is the pressure with which it is applied. The metal in the brush or plate (4) is a metal with an affinity for carbon e. g. iron, steel, or a steel alloy. The plate (4) metal hardness {{is less than half}} that of the coating (2) under treatment. The surface (2) is a-C, t-aC or diamond. USE - Diamond or hard carbon surface polishing tool. ADVANTAGE - The polishing sacrifices less of the workpiece surface material than prior art...|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{coatings}} have previously been visually identified {{on the surface}} of 105 -K East and 105 -K West Basins fuel elements. One type of coating (found only in K West Basin) in particular was found to be a thick translucent material that was often seen to be dislodged from the elements as flakes when the elements were handled during visual examinations (Pitner 1997). Subsequently it was determined (for one element only in a hot cell) that this material, in the dry condition, could easily be removed from the element using a scraping tool. The coating was identified as Al(OH) {sub 3 } through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses and to be approximately 60 {micro}m thick via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, brushing under water in the basin using numerous mechanical strokes failed to satisfactorily remove these coatings in their thickest form as judged by appearance. Such brushing was done with only one type of <b>metal</b> <b>brush,</b> a brush design previously found satisfactory for removing UO{sub 4 }. xH{sub 2 }O coatings from the elements...|$|E

50|$|Early {{machines}} used brushes {{made from}} strands of copper wire {{to contact the}} surface of the commutator. However, these hard <b>metal</b> <b>brushes</b> tended to scratch and groove the smooth commutator segments, eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between commutator segments, shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes.|$|R

Two small <b>metal</b> <b>brushes</b> rub against the buttons; the brushes are fixed to a curved conductor (covered with ebonite) that is clamped to the disks at opposite points and is {{in contact with the}} inductor’s tinfoil strips. In front of the buttons, fixed {{to the edge of the}} mobile disk towards the horizontal diameter, two brass collection combs, each having 10 points, are positioned in the direction of the disk.|$|R
30|$|The {{chitosan}} brush used in {{this study}} is made of a material that is soft with the aim to make a device optimized for removal of the biofilm within the implant threads. The soft bristles on the contrary make the device suboptimal for removal of hard deposits, such as calculus and cement remnants. It has been reported that such cement remnants are a common finding around dental implants [41], and in hindsight, it would have been beneficial for the analysis to record this. We did not record or analyse on cement- or screw-retained supraconstructions, and {{it may well be that}} some of the implants with cement-retained crowns and bridges had subgingival and non-visible cement remnants contributing to the mucosal inflammation. It can thus be hypothesized that combining the brush with an instrument for the removal of potential hard deposits would have yielded even better results. One such instrument for surgical use on titanium surfaces is a rotating titanium brush. The disadvantage with such a rigid <b>metal</b> <b>brush</b> is that the metal bristles may potentially cause injure to the mucosa if used non-surgically. Once active peri-implantitis treatment is finished with a positive response verified and the long-term and regular supportive treatment phase initiated, it could be argued that avoiding instruments that may damage the implant surface is preferable [15]. The consecutive case series presented here does only show the potential merits of a chitosan brush on reducing peri-implant mucosal inflammation. No control group was included in this study, and to test the clinical efficacy of this novel device in the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, a randomized clinical trial will be required. It is also important with a long-term follow-up to study if the use of this novel device will prevent progression of peri-implant bone loss over time, potentially causing implant loss.|$|E

50|$|The {{demountable}} drums on {{the front}} of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine. This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected in series by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of <b>metal</b> <b>brushes.</b> When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before restarting it.|$|R

50|$|The {{instrument}} {{has been}} played {{not only with}} hands, but also with plastic and <b>metal</b> <b>brushes,</b> as used for drum kits. Another way of playing the cajón is to use an ordinary bass drum pedal, thus turning the cajón into an indirect percussion instrument which can be played with the feet. This enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-bass drum, thus leaving the hands (and one other foot) free to play other instruments. On the other hand, it also restricts the player's standard cajón-playing position, as when the cajón {{is placed on the}} ground, in the bass drum location, it is hard for the performer to slap it with her or his hands.|$|R

5000|$|The {{commutator}} {{is needed}} to produce direct current. When a loop of wire rotates in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it, and thus the potential induced in it, reverses with each half turn, generating an alternating current. However, {{in the early days}} of electric experimentation, alternating current generally had no known use. The few uses for electricity, such as electroplating, used direct current provided by messy liquid batteries. Dynamos were invented as a replacement for batteries. The commutator is essentially a rotary switch. It consists of a set of contacts mounted on the machine's shaft, combined with graphite-block stationary contacts, called [...] "brushes", because the earliest such fixed contacts were <b>metal</b> <b>brushes.</b> The commutator reverses the connection of the windings to the external circuit when the potential reverses, so instead of alternating current, a pulsing direct current is produced.|$|R
