40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{prerequisite to}} successfully integrating protein data is detecting duplicate records spread across different databases. In this paper, we describe a new framework for protein entity resolution, called PERF, which deduplicates protein <b>mentions</b> using {{a wide range}} of protein attributes. A <b>mention</b> refers to any recorded information about a protein, whether it is derived from a database, a high-throughput study, or literature text mining, among others. PERF can be easily extended to deduplicate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as well. This framework translates <b>mentions</b> into instances of a reference schema to facilitate <b>mention</b> comparisons. PERF also uses “virtual attribute dependencies” to “enhance ” <b>mentions</b> with additional attribute values. PERF computes a likelihood measure based upon the textual value similarity of <b>mention</b> attributes. A prototype implementation of the framework was tested, and these tests indicate that PERF can clearly separate duplicate <b>mentions</b> from non-duplicate <b>mentions.</b> ...|$|R
