5|$|On the February 3, 2016 {{episode of}} Lucha Underground, <b>Mundo</b> faced Killshot in a winning effort. After the match, <b>Mundo</b> taunted Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes, {{only to be}} confronted by Cage. <b>Mundo</b> {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet. On the May 25 episode of Lucha Underground, Taya revealed to PJ Black and Jack Evans that their partner Fénix was injured by <b>Mundo.</b> As <b>Mundo</b> revealed himself as Fénix's replacement for their match, Black and Evans allied with the two. Later {{that night in the}} main event, <b>Mundo,</b> Black and Evans defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in Lucha Underground. The week after, <b>Mundo,</b> Black and Evans, now collectively billed as Worldwide Underground, retained their championships in a rematch via disqualification. During the match, <b>Mundo</b> delivered a low blow to Azteca Jr. while Taya distracted the referee. After seeing Mundo's actions, Puma hit a low blow to <b>Mundo,</b> causing a disqualification towards Puma's team. On the June 8 episode of Lucha Underground, <b>Mundo</b> teamed up with Taya, Ivelisse, Fénix, King Cuerno and Pentagón Jr. in a 12-man tag team match where the winning team would go on to face each other in a six-man elimination match to determine the No. 1 contender for the Lucha Underground Championship.

5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Hennigan had signed with the El Rey network's new television series, Lucha Underground, where he wrestled under the ring name Johnny <b>Mundo.</b> <b>Mundo</b> wrestled in the main event of the debut episode of Lucha Underground on October 29, 2014, defeating Prince Puma and winning one hundred thousand dollars, which was then taken away from him by promoter Dario Cueto, setting up several feuds. He then teamed with Prince Puma during the November 5, 2014 episode, defeating Cortez Castro and Mr. Cisco. On the November 19 episode, <b>Mundo</b> defeated Big Ryck by disqualification after interference by Castro and Cisco. <b>Mundo</b> then defeated Prince Puma and Big Ryck in the main event of the December 10, 2014 episode, which was a three-way ladder match, to finally win the hundred thousand dollars he was denied in the Lucha Underground debut.|$|E

5|$|During the 7th century {{there were}} {{significant}} changes to the East Platform, including {{a new version of}} Temple 5D-87 that faced away from the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido. Around AD 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top, making Temple 5D-87 one of the three highest structures in the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido. This new version created a new orienting axis in the complex, breaking the primary axis associated with the ancient E-Group complex and its relationship with the old solar cult, thus marking a major change in the ceremonial use of the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido complex. It is about this same time that the twin pyramid complex came into use, demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of the city. During the Late Classic, access to the complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures, this included discontinuing the use of the causeway that had linked the complex with the North Acropolis since the Preclassic. A new palace complex was built in the northern section of the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido, developing during the 7th and 8th centuries AD; This marked an important change {{in the use of the}} <b>Mundo</b> Perdido, which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities. The construction of the palace indicates the permanent inhabitation of the complex by an elite group, apparently involved in some way with the administration of the city.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, at Triplemanía XXV, <b>Mundo</b> {{successfully}} {{defended his}} three championships against Fantasma and Texano in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. On October 1 at Héroes Inmortales XI, <b>Mundo</b> wrestled in three matches, retaining the Mega Championship against Rey Wagner, but losing the Latin American Championship to Fantasma {{in the annual}} Copa Antonio Peña battle royal, and the World Cruiserweight Championship to Lanzelot in a ten-way match, ending his triple championship reign at 196 days.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5D-87 is {{also known}} as the Temple of the Skulls (Templo de las Calaveras in Spanish). It is the third largest temple in the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido complex. A new version of this temple was {{superimposed}} upon a preceding version during the 7th century AD. This new version faced away from the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido and possessed a single room with five doorways that faced onto the adjacent Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. Around AD 700, this version was sealed and a new version was built on top, at which time it became one of the highest structures in the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido. This version of the structure had a four-level platform with an access stairway interrupted by a vaulted niche, as was the architectural style prevalent at Tikal during this time. The base of the niche was adorned with three sculpted skulls, one facing forwards and the two flanking skulls in profile.|$|E

5|$|That a large {{population}} remained in residence in the north sector of <b>Mundo</b> Perdido during the Terminal Classic {{is evidenced by the}} quantity of burials of differing gender and age. Some were interred inside collapsed buildings or in casual graves. They were usually accompanied by very few funerary offerings, generally bone and lithic artefacts. The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at least a hundred years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned. The occupation of the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido came to an end in the Terminal Classic and very few traces of Postclassic activity have been recovered, limited to a few ceramic finds in Structure 3D-43 to the north.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mundo</b> Perdido is to {{the west}} of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It is the largest {{ceremonial}} complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal. The complex was organized as a large E-Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples. The <b>Mundo</b> Perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history. By AD 250300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, including the use of the talud-tablero form. During the Early Classic period (c. 250600) the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido became one of the twin foci of the city, the other being the North Acropolis. From AD 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis. The <b>Mundo</b> Perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform {{to the west of}} it.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} that Aizen kidnapped Orihime, Rukia and friends head for Hueco <b>Mundo</b> to rescue her. While there, Rukia encounters the Espada, Aaroniero Arruruerie, who is revealed to have possession of Kaien's body. Saddened {{that she had}} not saved her mentor from the control of a hollow as she had previously thought, Rukia manages to kill Aaroniero. Rukia is badly injured during the battle, and it is not until Soul Society sends reinforcements to Hueco <b>Mundo</b> that she is revived and her wounds are healed. She later assists Ichigo in his rescue to save Orihime from the Espada Ulquiorra Cifer by engaging the remaining Arrancars until requiring support. Following Aizen's defeat and the loss of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers, Rukia and Ichigo bid one another farewell as Ichigo loses the ability to sense Rukia's presence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, La Luz del <b>Mundo</b> Church began {{promoting}} women to public relations positions that were previously held by men only. As of December 2014, two women (and three men) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico. Public relations positions that have been held by women include spokesperson, director of social communication, and assistant director of international affairs. Within church operated civil organizations women also occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del <b>Mundo</b> Family Services, a violence prevention and intervention center in South Side, Milwaukee; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation; president of Recab de México A.C.; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA.|$|E

5|$|Burial 21 was {{the first}} corbel-vaulted tomb to be {{constructed}} in the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido; it was placed within Structure 5D-86. The deceased was interred upon the east-west axis running through {{the centre of the}} E-Group during the transition between the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic periods. The tomb was elite-status and was perhaps the earliest royal burial in the <b>Mundo</b> Perdido. Any funerary offerings were removed during the 6th century AD during remodelling of the temple, at which time the offerings were redeposited under the third chamber of the shrine. The offerings included three polychrome plates with mammiform legs; the painted designs on the plates perhaps have astronomical significance.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, in {{its most}} {{significant}} schism, at least 250 members left the Church. Tensions began to build after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del <b>Mundo</b> of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members of La Luz del <b>Mundo</b> attribute this episode to the envy and ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del <b>Mundo.</b> The leader is considered a prophet of God. As of 2010, El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17,700 in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In El Salvador, as of 2009, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 70,000 members of La Luz del <b>Mundo,</b> which had 140 congregations with a minister and 160 other congregations with between 13 and 80 members. As of 2008, there were around 60,000 members of the Church in the United States.|$|E
