500|$|The portraits gave Van Gogh {{his best}} {{opportunity}} to earn. He {{believed they were}} [...] "the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the infinite." [...] He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, {{and that he would}} use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.|$|E
500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves {{has been part of}} everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
60|$|After each {{question}} he tilted <b>me</b> over <b>a</b> little more, {{so as to}} give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> helplessness and danger.|$|R
2500|$|Williams stated, [...] "My {{children}} give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> wonder. Just to {{see them}} develop into these extraordinary human beings." ...|$|R
60|$|Her look of astonishment, as she loosed my {{hand and}} started away from me, {{recalled}} <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> my strange, my criminal indiscretion.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until the}} morning meal had been cooked and was {{spread on the}} table did Simon Kenton return, and the news which he brought gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> deepest relief.|$|E
6000|$|The Holly-Tree {{was fast}} {{reviving}} within <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loneliness. I {{began to feel}} conscious that my subject would never carry on until I was dug out. I might be a week here,--weeks! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{you think}} {{me a good}} fellow; isn't that it?" [...] She said nothing, and he went on: [...] "You don't {{seem to have any}} reason, and that gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> injustice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And is this all? My inspiration!--you {{who were}} {{awakening}} <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{the greatness of}} real life--you who would have led me and aided <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> nobler course--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> that <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty is natural to man," [...] said Lothair, [...] "and {{that there can}} be no {{satisfaction}} in life without attempting to fulfil it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta {{engaged in}} this act for a while. [...] "You're like the {{stricken}} deer, seeking the innermost shade. Oh, you do give <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> helplessness!" [...] she broke out.|$|R
60|$|Through the port-holes I beheld an unruffled, sun-smitten horizon. The {{horizon of}} a windless day. But its {{spaciousness}} alone {{was enough to}} give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a fortunate escape, a momentary exultation of freedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can write--so long as I {{have you}} to write for and to work for," [...] he replied. [...] "You are the {{greatest}} woman in the world. Your faith in me, your forgiveness of my cowardice, have given <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> power--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, and to Boulogne,' said Bagwax, proudly. 'But {{the desire}} of travel grows with the thing it feeds on. I long to {{overcome}} great distances,--to feel that I have put illimitable space behind me. To set my foot on shores divided from these by the thickness of all the earth would give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> grandeur which I--which,--which,--would be magnificent.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sense of humour!" [...] he said. [...] "My <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour! <b>Me</b> without <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour! Why, I suppose I've <b>a</b> keener <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour {{than any}} man, or any two men, in this city!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. It gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> horrible <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt." [...] She, shuddered again. Then suddenly, {{with the}} nervous quickness {{of a woman}} unstrung, thrust a small black golliwog into his hand.|$|R
60|$|That act, however, {{served to}} arouse <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> my position. What did I there? It was a profanity--a defiling, I swore; from which you'll see, that Bardelys was grown {{of a sudden}} very nice.|$|R
6000|$|This {{statement}} of the Border's poverty and drought was the more moving to me {{for the reason that}} the old pioneer had always been so patriotic, so confident, so sanguine of his country's future. He had {{come a long way from}} the buoyant faith of '66, and the change in him was typical of the change in the West--in America--and it produced in <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dismay, of rebellious bitterness. Why should our great new land fall into this slough of discouragement? ...|$|E
6000|$|On my own part, too, I am free {{to confess}} that my wife's {{attitude}} had aroused in <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> pique, {{not to say}} injustice. I am {{not in any way}} a vain man. Yet her attitude wounded me. I would no sooner begin, [...] "When I was in the Himalayas hunting the humpo or humped buffalo," [...] than she would interrupt and say, [...] "Oh, Harold, would you mind going down to the billiard-room and seeing if I left my cigarettes under the billiard-table?" [...] When I returned, she was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Headworth {{came when}} I was {{four or five}} years old. Edda, as we used to call her in May's language, was the first person who gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> beauty. She had dark eyes and a lovely complexion. I {{remember}} in after times being silenced for saying, [...] "not so pretty as my Edda." [...] I was extremely fond of her, enough to have my small jealousy excited when my uncle joined us in our walks, and monopolised her, turning May and me over to play with his dog!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. It gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> horrible <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt." [...] She shuddered again. Then suddenly, {{with the}} nervous quickness {{of a woman}} unstrung, thrust a small black golliwog into his hand. [...] "Take it!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was perhaps}} too absorbed {{to pay any}} great {{attention}} to the impression my verses were producing, but presently, {{in one of my}} pauses, the Lord Filippo startled me with words that awoke <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> my imprudence.|$|R
50|$|My love {{of metal}} came {{from him and}} Fluxus as at art school I’d majored in ‘hard media’ (stone, wood, bone, glass, plastic etc) as opposed to metal. This is a love affair that I can’t let go of. He imbued <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the history of working with metal.|$|R
60|$|I awoke {{sometime}} later to find Moze had sought {{the warmth of}} my side, and he lay so near my arm that I reached out and covered him with an end of the blanket I used to break the wind. It was very cold and the time {{must have been very}} late, for the wind had died down, and I heard not a tinkle from the hobbled horses. The absence of the cowbell music gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loneliness, for without it the silence of the great forest was a thing to be felt.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was pleasant. In {{spite of my}} uncertainty, it gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> pleased confidence {{to be in the}} Cheritons' company. I had taken to them at once: and the more I talked with them, the better I liked them. Especially Jack, that nice brotherly Jack, who seemed almost like an old friend to me. You get to know people so well on a long railway journey. I was quite sorry to think that by five o'clock that afternoon we should reach Adolphus Town, and so part company.|$|E
60|$|As I {{held the}} {{telegram}} in my hand, the room seemed to whirl around me; and, if the attentive maître d'hôtel had not caught me, I think I should have fallen. There was something so strange in all this, something so weird and impossible to imagine, that there grew on <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> my being {{in some way}} the sport of opposite forces--the mere vague idea of which seemed {{in a way to}} paralyse me. I was certainly under some form of mysterious protection. From a distant country had come, in the very nick of time, a message that took me out of the danger of the snow-sleep and the jaws of the wolf.|$|E
5000|$|Born {{and raised}} in Toronto, Piccolo began her career in 1989 when her first cartoon {{submission}} was accepted by Now magazine. According to Piccolo, her [...] "early acceptance gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> how hard the next years were going to be. It was followed by trillions of rejections." ...|$|R
60|$|Night was {{my usual}} time for {{correcting}} devoirs, {{and my own}} room the usual scene of such task--task most onerous hitherto; and it seemed strange to me to feel rising within <b>me</b> <b>an</b> incipient <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> interest, as I snuffed the candle and addressed myself to the perusal of the poor teacher's manuscript.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know I {{have been}} much to blame,' said Theodora, still with her head bent down and half turned away. 'Ever since I was a child, I have been undutiful and rebellious. Being with Violet has {{gradually}} brought <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> it. I do wish to make a fresh beginning, and {{to ask you to}} forgive and bear with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{brought up}} and defined {{many of the}} events of our life in the coulee, {{pictures}} which were becoming a little vague, a little blurred. Al Randal and Ed Green, who were already almost mythical, were spoken of as living creatures and thus the far was brought near. Comparisons between {{the old and the new}} methods of seeding and harvest also gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> change, a perception which troubled me a little, especially as a wistful note had crept into the voices of these giants of the middle border. They all loved the wilderness too well not to be a little saddened by the clearing away of bosky coverts and the drying up of rippling streams.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, turning {{round with}} animation, [...] "my natural disposition, always repressed, because I have felt {{overwhelmed}} by the desolation of the world. But now I have hope; I have more than hope, I have joy. I feel sure this idea of the restoration of Christendom comes from Heaven. It has restored me to myself, and has given <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> happiness in this life which I never could contemplate. But what is the climax of my joy is, that you, after all my own blood, and one in whose career I have ever felt the deepest interest, should be ordained to lay, as it were, the first stone of this temple of divine love." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{opened my}} eyes. My shelter {{was a small}} cave, {{no more than three}} feet in height and a dozen in length. It was very hot in the cave. Perspiration noduled the entire surface of my body. Now and again several nodules {{coalesced}} and formed tiny rivulets. I wore no clothing save a filthy rag about the middle. My skin was burned to a mahogany brown. I was very thin, and I contemplated my thinness with a strange sort of pride, {{as if it were an}} achievement to be so thin. Especially was I enamoured of my painfully prominent ribs. The very sight of the hollows between them gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> solemn elation, or, rather, to use a better word, of sanctification.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never meant}} it,' said Louis, 'but I never could love that monument. It used to oppress <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> white marble mother! And, seriously, it fills up the chancel {{as if it}} were its show-room, {{according}} to our family tradition that the church is dedicated to the Fitzjocelyns. Living or dead, we have taken it all to ourselves.' ...|$|R
60|$|A chill {{came over}} <b>me,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dread which I am ashamed of having felt now, but which I could not combat then. The blessed {{light of day}} was pouring down gayly {{at the other end}} of the vault through the open door. I turned my back on the empty niche, and hurried into the {{sunlight}} and the fresh air.|$|R
6000|$|A {{friendly}} policeman volunteered {{the news}} {{that he had seen}} Twain or [...] "some one very like him" [...] driving a buggy the day before. This gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> delightful <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nearness. Fancy living in a town where you could see the author of Tom Sawyer, or [...] "some one very like him," [...] jolting over the pavements in a buggy! ...|$|R
