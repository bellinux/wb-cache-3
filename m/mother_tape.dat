40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{conversational}} patterns used by 24 children aged eighteen months to three years and their <b>mothers.</b> <b>Tape</b> recordings were made of the mothers and the children both in a free speech situation and while they were talking about a picture book. The mean length of utterance, frequency of usage of different types of utterance, and the way that these different types of utterances formed conversational units were examined, and related to the child's age, social class, sex, and whether the conversation was directed towards the picture book or was in a free situation. It was found that the child 1 s mean length of utterance was related both to his age and to the situation. The patterns of utterances which made up the conversations were also related to both age and situation. It was also found that in the book situation the mother's and the children's speech became less complex and similar in form to the free speech of younger children and their mothers. The patterns of utterance types within conversational units was found to be very stereotyped with a small number of patterns repeated frequently. Computer sorting of these patterns showed that they did not often consist of more than two items, and higher order patterns consisted of repetitions of shorter frequently occurring patterns. The mother's speech was found to be related to their child's own level of complexity, but to be slightly in advance of the child's own competence. It was proposed that this kind of simplified speech would be a highly appropriate setting for language learning to take place. <p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{resources}} that two hearing mothers of a hearing child (Hh) and two hearing mothers of a deaf child (Hd) call in to attract their 1 to 3 years-old child's attention and create sequences of joint attention. All four dyads were recorded in their homes, while conducting everyday activities. The data was systematically annotated with the ELAN software. The resources we identified were classified into three different types according to the modality they involved: audio-oral, visual and gestural, and tactile. The {{results show that the}} Hd mothers rely much more on visual-gestural and tactile resources than the Hh <b>mothers,</b> including <b>taping</b> on the child's body. The mother of the deaf child with no hearing aids used audio-oral resources often. The mother of the deaf implanted child shows specific adaptation according to whether her child is using his cochlear implants or not. We suggest that recent evolutions (in hearing aids on the one hand, and in regards to sign language and multimodality on the other hand) may shape in a new way the nature of the interactions between hearing mothers and their deaf child...|$|R

40|$|The nurse's {{knowledge}} of patients' experiences contributes to gaining {{a deeper understanding}} of their health process and enables the nurse to develop a caring, therapeutic relationship. There is very little literature that focuses on the experiences of teenage mothers whose babies are in the neonatal unit. Therefore the purpose of this phenomenological study was to enquire into their experiences. The background to the study was outlined including the neonatal environment, family centred care, needs of parents in the neonatal unit, adolescence and teenage mothers. The phenomenological framework of van Manen and its application to this study has been described. The {{purpose of the study was}} to hear and value the stories as told by the teen mothers; inform and strengthen health care practice and identify areas of change if change is necessary. Conversations with four teenage <b>mothers</b> were <b>taped,</b> transcribed and then analysed using van Manen's (1997) approach to researching lived experience. From the analysis two main themes emerged – the need to do [mothering] and being in a safe place. A third theme – the emotional roller-coaster – was also identified and ran throughout the stories. The experiences of the teenage mothers were compared and contrasted with the existing literature. A key finding of the research was that teenage mothers, despite their developmental stage, had similar experiences to those of older mothers in the same situation. Additionally, their competence at mothering was greater than might have been expected. Recommendations were made related to 'family centred care' in the neonatal unit to ensure all mothers have the support, information and education they need. Additionally, the research supports the development of strong therapeutic relationships with mothers based on partnership in decision making and care giving which, in turn, sees a transfer of power and control to the mother...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} understandings {{that mothers}} and midwives have of ethnicity. To explore {{barriers to the}} successful implementation of ethnicity screening questions for sickle cell/thalassaemia. Design Observation of 121 first antenatal interviews between midwife and mother in four contrasting areas of sickle cell prevalence in England. Taped interviews with 111 <b>mothers</b> and 115 <b>taped</b> interviews with 61 different midwives. Fieldwork data from 76 preparatory workshops and liaison meetings. Results 'Ethnicity' and 'family' are terms liable to variable interpretation. Both midwives and mothers implied belief in distinct 'racial' groups, disrupting scientifically accurate understandings {{of the relation between}} risk of sickle cell/thalassaemia and ethnic/family origins. Bookings were characterised by time pressures and a lack of explanation of sickle cell/thalassaemia. The mother was not permitted to self-assign ethnicity in 13 of 115 observed encounters. Conclusions Antenatal screening for sickle cell/thalassaemia based on an ethnicity screening question is weakened by a range of factors. Some midwives use intuition to select/exclude clients from the screening questions rather than implement formal policy. The screening term 'ethnic/family origins' is vulnerable to varied interpretations by clients. The persistence of erroneous beliefs in 'racial' groups displaces correct understandings of the relation between ethnicity and risk of carrying genes associated with sickle cell/thalassaemia. Midwives require support in both in ethnicity awareness and knowledge of sickle cell and thalassaemia, and more time at antenatal bookings to administer the ethnicity screening question. A challenge to the continued prevalence of scientific racism in popular discourse is required.

40|$|Background Mid-upper arm {{circumference}} (MUAC) {{was recently}} endorsed and recommended for screening for acute malnutrition in the community. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether a colour-banded MUAC strap would allow minimally trained mothers to screen their own children for malnutrition, without locating the mid-point of the left upper arm by measurement, as currently recommended. Methods A non-randomised non-blinded evaluation of mothers’ performance when measuring MUAC after minimal training, compared with trained Community Health Workers (CHW) following current MUAC protocols. The study was conducted in 2 villages in Mirriah, Zinder region, Niger where mothers classified one of their children (n[*]=[*] 103) aged 6 – 59 months (the current age range for admission into community malnutrition programs) using the MUAC tape. Results Mothers’ had a sensitivity and specificity for classification of their child’s nutritional status of[*]>[*] 90 % and[*]>[*] 80 % respectively for global acute malnutrition (GAM, defined by a MUAC[*] [*] 73 % and[*]>[*] 98 % for severe acute malnutrition (SAM, defined by a MUAC[*]<[*] 115 mm). The few children misclassified as not having SAM, were classified as having moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). The choice of arm did not influence the classification results; weighted Kappa of 0. 88 for mothers and 0. 91 for CHW represent almost perfect agreement. Errors occurred at the class boundaries and no gross errors were made. Conclusions Advanced SAM is associated with severe complications, which often require hospital admission or cause death. <b>Mothers</b> (with MUAC <b>tapes</b> costing $ 0. 06) can screen their children frequently allowing early diagnosis and treatment thereby becoming the focal point in scaling-up community management of acute malnutrition.
