5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mutation</b> <b>in</b> the {{position}} 485 (W → A): A tryptophan is changed by an alanine. Although {{it is not}} a coiled coil, it also abolishes interaction with Rab11-FIP2, just like the <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> {{the position}} 203.|$|R
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL {{receptor}} protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|BHD can be {{suggested}} by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> the FLCN gene.

5|$|During 2005, {{the largest}} {{recorded}} epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua.

5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, AML {{became the}} first cancer genome to be fully sequenced. DNA {{extracted}} from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin. The leukemic cells contained acquired <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> several genes that had not previously {{been associated with the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{strongly}} inherited gene mutations (including <b>mutations</b> <b>in</b> BRCA2) {{account for}} only 5-10% of breast cancer cases; the specific risk of getting breast or other cancer for anyone carrying a BRCA2 mutation depends on many factors.|$|E

40|$|In Japanese {{pediatric}} {{patients with}} thyrotropin (TSH) resistance, the R 450 H <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> TSH receptor gene (TSHR) is occasionally observed. We studied {{the frequency and}} clinical implication of the R 450 H <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> TSHR {{in the general population}} of Japanese adults using smart amplification process 2 (SmartAmp 2). We designed SmartAmp 2 primer sets to detect this mutation using a drop of whole blood. We analyzed thyroid function, antithyroid antibodies, and this <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> 429 Japanese participants who had not been found to have thyroid disease. Two cases without antithyroid antibodies were heterozygous for the R 450 H <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> TSHR. Thus, the prevalence of this mutation was 0. 47 % in the general population and 0. 63 % among those without antithyroid antibodies. Their serum TSH concentrations were higher than the average TSH concentration not only in subjects without antithyroid antibodies but also in those with antithyroid antibodies. The R 450 H <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> TSHR is relatively common in the Japanese population and potentially affects thyroid function. The present study demonstrates that the SmartAmp 2 method is useful to detect the R 450 H <b>mutation</b> <b>in</b> TSHR, {{which is one of the}} common causes of TSH resistance in the Japanese population...|$|R
