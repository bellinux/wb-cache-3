5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E

25|$|Douglas' {{work only}} touches on race {{directly}} {{in a few}} instances, such as the short video I'm Not Gary (1991). This interpretation of race is important, as the brief narrative involves a white man mistaking a black <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> different black man named Gary, for writer Lisa Coulthard, {{this is part of}} a larger investigation of racism as part of imperialism and cultural invisibility. For Coulthard, the lack of mention of race in works that feature only white performers troubles any racial reading of Douglas' work.|$|E
25|$|He {{served as}} the town rabbi of Radin for a short period. He then {{resigned}} from this position to establish the yeshiva in the city, which eventually became world-famous.

The process of burial contains four steps: Sutchihun (cleaning the body), Saputan (wrapping the body), Sambayanganun (obligatory prayer), and Hikubul (burial). The grave is created hollow under 6 to 9 feet depth in North-South direction, which will be prayed upon by a religious <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peaceful rest of the dead. Afterwards, the grave will be closed using ding ding hali (means “wall of the rest”) made of huge flat slab.|$|E

But God shuts up the mouths of the lions, and the next morning Darius rejoices to find him unharmed. The king casts Daniel's accusers into the lions' pit together with their wives and children to be instantly devoured, while he himself acknowledges Daniel's God as he whose kingdom shall never be destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Following the ousting of C Company {{from the}} Shankill Road, Adair's family and {{supporters}} went to Bolton where they garnered the nickname 'Bolton Wanderers' after the football club {{of the same}} name. Following the killing of LVF leader Billy Wright in 1997 Adair became the new contact <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> group of Bolton-based members of the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 (C18) who {{up to that point}} had been close to the LVF. Adair built up a close relationship with these far right activists, even wearing an England shirt during UEFA Euro 2000 that one of the members had given him. Furthermore, when the feud with the UVF was launched in 2000 through C Company members attacking the UVF's Rex Bar stronghold a few C18 members fought alongside the UDA men. As a result, it was to the homes of these far rightists, in particular a Bolton-based tattoo artist and C18 member, that Adair's supporters fled to in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Caine ignored {{their advice}} but did adapt the plot and {{characters}} {{to some of}} T.E. Brown's suggestions. He also sought the advice of two other Manxmen, A.W. Moore and Sir James Gell, particularly on the legal background of the novel. Having assembled his materials, Caine wrote the novel at his house in Bexley {{in the space of}} only seven months, a feat made possible by his recycling material from his 1885 novella, She's All The World To Me, in particular the central scene of Ewan's body floating back to shore. Caine visited the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week in August to check the locations of some scenes in the novel and by September the novel was ready to go to the publisher. In financial need, Caine sold the copyright to Chatto & Windus for £150, signing the contract on 27 September 1887. Unfortunately for Caine, the terms of the contract meant that he did not gain the wealth of royalties when the book became a best-seller upon its release in November. Indeed, in 1921 when Caine wanted to release his Collected Works through a different publisher, he would have to pay £350 to Chatto & Windus for the rights to The Deemster.|$|E
25|$|The two Indians {{continued}} to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The {{only time in}} which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's head for a four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, just when it seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman flashed a short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not {{get his hands on}} the ball, and it went away through third <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get an edge to Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.|$|E

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{attempted}} an unorthodox {{deployment of}} his late-inning relievers in an August 24 rubber {{game against the}} Houston Astros in interleague play, sending out Doolittle for the eighth and Kintzler for the ninth. Both relievers struggled, with Doolittle allowing a run before Kintzler allowed two, blowing the save opportunity. The Nationals ultimately won {{the game and the}} series 5–4 in the eleventh inning, with Solis earning the save, the first of his career. Baker explained after the game that he had been attempting to play matchups, using Doolittle against left-handed batters in the eighth before Kintzler handled Houston's right-handed batters in the ninth; Kintzler, however, said the Nationals were {{trying to get him to}} 30 saves on the season, after he had collected 28 with the Twins prior to being traded at the end of July. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., on August 25, the Nationals optioned Severino to Syracuse and recalled Cole for a spot start against the division rival New York Mets, in which Cole took the loss despite allowing only one run over six innings and setting a new personal best for strikeouts with eight in what ended as a 4–2 Mets victory. In a harrowing moment in the eighth inning of the next game in the series on August 26, a 9–4 bounceback victory for Washington, Nationals second baseman Adrián Sánchez was felled by a foul tip into the chest after trying to bunt away a 97-mph fastball from Mets reliever Jeurys Familia that sailed in on him. Sánchez was able to finish out his at-bat, driving home a run with a single into left field for his third RBI of the day, before being pulled from the game and hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. Sánchez was released in the morning after a CT test determined he had escaped serious injury. Cole was optioned back to the minors on August 27, as outfielder Rafael Bautista was recalled and Fedde was brought up as the 26th <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day-night doubleheader against the Mets. The Nationals split the doubleheader, losing the first game — displaying diminished velocity and giving up five runs on two home runs, Fedde took a no-decision as the Nationals rallied back from a five-run deficit only to lose 6–5, as pinch-runner Edwin Jackson was thrown out at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning to end the game — and winning the second 5–4 behind a quality start from Tanner Roark and a go-ahead RBI by Stevenson, the first of his career, on a bases-loaded walk.|$|E
