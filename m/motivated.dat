The theoretical part deals with importance of the <b>motivating</b> employees for the success of the company.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} three beliefs in predicting teachers' <b>motivating</b> style toward students-namely, how effective, how normative, and how easy-to-implement autonomy-supportive and controlling teaching were each believed to be. We further examined national collectivism-individualism {{as a predictor of}} individual teachers' <b>motivating</b> style and beliefs about <b>motivating</b> style, as we expected that a collectivistic perspective would tend teachers toward the controlling style and toward positive beliefs about that style. Participants were 815 full-time PreK- 12 public school teachers from eight different nations that varied in collectivism-individualism. All three teacher beliefs explained independent and substantial variance in teachers' self-described <b>motivating</b> styles. Believed effectiveness was a particularly strong predictor of self-described <b>motivating</b> style. Collectivism-individualism predicted which teachers were most likely to self-describe a controlling <b>motivating</b> style, and a mediation analysis showed that teachers in collectivistic nations self-described a controlling style because they believed it to be culturally normative classroom practice. These findings enhance the literature on the antecedents of teachers' <b>motivating</b> styles by showing that teacher beliefs strongly predict <b>motivating</b> style, and that culture informs one of these beliefs-namely, normalcy...|$|R

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are <b>motivated</b> not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always <b>motivated</b> by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Motivating</b> {{innovation}} {{is an important}} concern in many incentive problems. For example, shareholders of large corporations often need to <b>motivate</b> managers to pursue more innovative business strategies. This paper shows that the optimal incentive scheme that <b>motivates</b> innovation exhibits substantial tolerance (or even reward) for early failure and reward for long-term success. Moreover, commitment to a long-term compensation plan, job security, and timely feedback on performance are also essential ingredients to <b>motivate</b> innovation. In the context of managerial compensation, the optimal incentive scheme that <b>motivates</b> innovation can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long vesting periods, option repricing, golden parachutes, and managerial entrenchment.
