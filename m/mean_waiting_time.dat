40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} single server queues with several groups and several classes of customers. We consider priority scheduling algorithms for the multiclass queues {{in which the}} server admits customers in each group into the service facility by 1 -limited disciplines or by gated disciplines. Our objective is to show a method for deriving <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for these multiclass M/G/l queues. From {{the analysis of the}} busy periods, we investigate some linear structure inherent in the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> conditioned on the system state at each customer's arrival epoch.

40|$|We {{present a}} general method for the {{derivation}} of various statistical quantities describing {{the detection of}} a beam of atoms emerging from a micromaser. The use of non-normalized conditioned density operators and a linear master equation for the dynamics between detection events is discussed as are the counting statistics, sequence statistics, and <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> statistics. In particular, we derive expressions for {{the mean number of}} successive detections of atoms in one of any two orthogonal states of the two-level atom. We also derive expressions for the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> between detections. We show that the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> between detections of atoms in like states are equivalent to the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> calculated from the uncorrelated steady state detection rates, though like atoms are indeed correlated. The <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> between detections of atoms in unlike states exhibit correlations. We evaluate the expressions for various detector efficiencies using numerical integration, reporting results for the standard micromaser arrangement in which the cavity is pumped by excited atoms and the excitation levels of the emerging atoms are measured. In addition, the atomic inversion and the Fano-Mandel function for the detection of de-excited atoms is calculated for comparison to the experimental results of Weidinger et al. [1], which reports the first observation of trapping states. ...|$|R

A fixed time polling scheme specifies not only the visit order of the queues, but also the starting time for each visit.

Using a simple approximation for the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> in a polling system with a non-cyclic visit order of the queues, we present an approach to the problem of minimizing a weighted sum of the <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> at the various queues.

40|$|Linear {{theory of}} {{stationary}} response in thermal systems subjected to external perturbations requires to find equilibrium correlation {{function of the}} responding system variable {{in the absence of}} external perturbations. Studies of the response of the systems exhibiting anomalously slow dynamics are often based on the continuous time random walk description (CTRW) with divergent <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> The bulk of the literature on anomalous response contains linear response functions like one by Cole-Cole calculated from such a CTRW theory and applied to thermal systems. Here we show within a fairly simple and general model that for the systems with divergent <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> the stationary response is absent, in accordance with some recent studies. The absence of stationary response at thermal equilibrium (or dying to zero non-stationary response in aging experiments) would confirm CTRW with divergent <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> as underlying physical relaxation mechanism, but reject it otherwise. We show that the absence of stationary response is closely related to the breaking of ergodicity of the corresponding dynamical variable. As an important new result, we derive a generalized Cole-Cole response within ergodic CTRW dynamics with finite <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Moreover, we provide a physically reasonable explanation of the origin and wide presence of 1 /f noise in condensed systems for ergodic dynamics close to normal, rather than mostly deviating...|$|R

40|$|The {{overhead}} {{associated with}} reconfiguring a switch fabric in optical packet switches {{is an important}} issue in relation to the packet transmission time and can adversely affect switch performance.

In all, 23  recordings with atrial fibrillation episodes of at least 1000  ventricular cycles and with <  20 % Holter artefacts or noise were used (11  recorded on placebo and 12  on digoxin). For each recording, the <b>mean</b> ("mean <b>waiting</b> time") and maximum ("maximum waiting time") duration of continuous sections of atrial fibrillation episodes with all RR intervals shorter than a certain threshold were evaluated, ranging the threshold from 400  to 1000  ms in 10  ms steps. For each threshold, the <b>mean</b> and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were compared between recordings on placebo and on digoxin.  Results—Both the <b>mean</b> and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> increased exponentially with increasing threshold. Practically acceptable <b>mean</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> less than one minute were observed with thresholds below 600  ms.

40|$|Background: One {{proposal}} to increase kidney transplantation is to exchange kidneys between pairs of ABO-incompatible (or crossmatch -incompatible) living donors and their recipients. One variation that has greater potential exchanges living donor kidneys for cadaveric donor kidneys (indirect exchanges). A primary concern with indirect exchanges {{is the potential}} to disadvantage blood group O wait list candidates. Using wait list modeling, we examine whether this proposal would disadvantage cadaveric kidney blood group O wait list candidates, and present an approach for minimizing these negative effects. Methods: A probability model estimated the total number and blood type frequencies of donor-recipient pairs that would participate in indirect exchanges. A supply-to-demand model for the cadaveric kidney wait list estimated the <b>mean</b> <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> under different allocation policies and donor selection mechanisms for candidates on the wait list classified according to the candidates' race and blood type. Results: Indirect exchanges will reduce the <b>mean</b> <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> for cadaveric kidney wait list candidates. The <b>mean</b> <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of blood group O cadaveric kidney wait list candidates increases when the participating living donors self-select and when kidney allocation is determined by efficiency. This is neutralized when the transplant team preferentially selects blood group O living donors and cadaveric kidney allocation is determined by need. Conclusion: Indirect exchange programs will significantly shorten the <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> for cadaveric kidney wait list candidates. The <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> of blood group O candidates will not be affected adversely if blood group O living donors are selected preferentially and if allocation is based on need. ...|$|R
