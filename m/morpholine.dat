5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the <b>morpholine</b> ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to <b>morpholine</b> rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E

The abilities of these functionalised <b>morpholines</b> and oxazepanes to inhibit a broad panel of glycosidase enzymes, that are associated with a range of diseases, have been probed and in this way new inhibitors of a range of glycosidases, but particularly β-d-galactosidase derived from Bovine kidney, have been discovered. N-Alkyl <b>morpholines</b> demonstrated the best inhibition profiles for this enzyme and derivatives (15 a) –(15 d) acted as non-competitive inhibitors with IC 50 values of 55. 1 – 88. 6 μM.

Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or <b>morpholine</b> to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E

500|$|The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the {{chemical}} [...] "template" [...] {{essential for}} antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an aryl group at position 3 and an S-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the R-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In {{addition to this}} essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An acetamide substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used {{in all of the}} more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used.

40|$|A RhIII-catalyzed direct ortho-C-H amidation/amination of benzoic acids with N-chlorocarbamates/N-chloromorpholines was achieved, giving anthranilic {{acids in}} up to 85 % yields with {{excellent}} ortho-selectivity and functional-group tolerance. Successful benzoic acid aminations were achieved with carbamates bearing various amide groups including NHCO 2 Me, NHCbz, and NHTroc (Cbz=carbobenzyloxy; Troc=trichloroethylchloroformate), as well as secondary amines, such as <b>morpholines,</b> piperizines, and piperidines, furnishing highly functionalized anthranilic acids. A stoichiometric reaction of a cyclometallated rhodium(III) complex of benzo[h]quinoline with a silver salt of N-chlorocarbamate afforded an amido-rhodium(III) complex, which was isolated and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. This finding confirmed that the C-N bond formation results from the cross-coupling of N-chlorocarbamate with the aryl-rhodium(III) complex. Yet, the mechanistic details regarding the C-N bond formation remain unclear; pathways involving 1, 2 -aryl migration and rhodium(V) - nitrene are plausible. Put an "N" to the ring!

The reactions with CumO• were described in all cases as direct hydrogen abstractions. The differences in the hydrogen abstraction rate constant (kH) were {{explained in terms of}} the different number of abstractable hydrogen atoms, the operation of stereoelectronic effects, and, with the <b>morpholines,</b> on the basis of polar effects.

A decrease in kH was observed going from secondary to tertiary amines and, with tertiary amines, on increasing steric hindrance at nitrogen, pointing toward the important role of steric and electronic effects on pre-reaction complex formation.
