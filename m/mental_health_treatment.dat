5|$|Alaska possessed no <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> {{facilities}} {{prior to}} the passage of the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Older {{adults are}} {{the fastest growing}} age group in Australia, necessitating an {{increase}} in appropriate <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services in the coming years. While Internet-delivered <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> have been established as acceptable and efficacious among younger samples, little research has explored whether they would be similarly useful in older populations. Methods: The participants {{were part of the}} Australian Rural <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> study, which explores <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and well-being in residents of non-metropolitan New South Wales. A postal survey was used to assess knowledge of and intentions to use Internet-delivered <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments.</b> Demographics, <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> and frequency of Internet use were also measured. Results: The survey was completed by 950 adults aged 50 - 93. The sample was largely unfamiliar with Internet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services, with 75 % reporting that they had never heard of them and a further 20 % not knowing any details of what they involved. Intentions to use these services were also low, at 13. 5 %; however, this increased with level of familiarity. Respondents with higher psychological distress, higher education, and more frequent Internet use {{were significantly more likely to}} consider using Internet treatments. Conclusions: Among older adults, overall awareness of Internet-delivered <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> appears to be limited; however, higher familiarity contributes to higher intentions to use these treatments. Importantly, respondents with higher distress and greater computer literacy were more likely to consider <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> delivered via the Internet. Future research exploring strategies to increase the promotion of these services to older samples may further improve their perceptions and use...|$|R

5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder is rarely {{the primary reason}} for people seeking <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment.</b> When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders, or at the insistence of relatives and friends. This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor insight and fail to recognize their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive self-image.|$|E

In the end, McGovern won the nomination at the Democratic National Convention.

40|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> {{disability}} imposes {{an enormous}} cost to patients, families, and society. Across free market countries, {{the rate of}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disability is growing and now constitutes about one third of all disability claimants.

This article reviews (a) {{the current status of}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disability and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disability systems, (b) the encouraging findings related to research on evidence-based treatments and supported employment, and (c) policy changes that might ameliorate the problem of rising rates (and costs) of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disability. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments,</b> employment services, and disability policies powerfully shape the disability experience. Evidence-based <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and employment services can ameliorate disability and could potentially prevent disability if applied as early interventions. Yet evidence-based <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> and supported employment services are rarely available. Furthermore, current disability policies tend to trap people in a “disability benefits culture. ” Policy changes should recognize that people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disabilities usually want to work, that they are often able to work when provided with appropriate <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and vocational services, and that employment is highly therapeutic.

25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{were raised}} about how Houser {{was able to}} obtain the gun used in the shooting. It was {{initially}} {{reported that he had}} been involuntarily committed for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> in 2008, which would have legally prohibited him from purchasing firearms. However, it was later determined {{that he was able to}} purchase the gun because a judge never committed him and instead had him undergo a mental health evaluation. Once the evaluation was done, medical authorities either had to release him, convince him to commit himself voluntarily for treatment, or petition a court to force him to undergo treatment. They never petitioned the court, but it was unclear if Houser was released or voluntarily committed. His 2008 evaluation was never officially reported to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.|$|E

The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order.

A bill to close the gun show loophole in Virginia was submitted, but eventually failed. Since then, Virginia lawmakers efforts to close the gun show loophole were continuously blocked by gun rights advocates.
