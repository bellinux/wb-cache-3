The flywheel angular velocity signal is analyzed, investigating how to use the signal in order to best detect misfires. An algorithm for engine <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> is proposed based on the flywheel angular velocity signal. The flywheel signal is used to estimate the torque at the flywheel and a test quantity is designed by weighting and thresholding the samples of estimated torque related to one combustion. During the development process, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to analyze the ability to detect a misfire given a test quantity and how the misfire detectability performance varies depending on, e. g., load and speed. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is also used for parameter optimization to maximize the difference between misfire data and fault-free data.

40|$|HCCI {{engines are}} likely {{to become one of the}} future {{alternatives}} to SI engines due to their ability to deliver high efficiency and low NOx emissions. There are, however, problems with the control of the ignition and heat release rate over the entire load and the speed range, which limits the practical application of this technology. In order to investigate the combustion parameters of both SI and HCCI gasoline engines, a widely used and powerful diagnostic tool is the analysis of the in-cylinder pressure time history as derived from in-cylinder pressure transducers. Such information has particular application in HCCI engines for control of TRG levels, valve timing, <b>misfire</b> and knock <b>detection.</b> Unfortunately, although the use of in-cylinder pressure transducers for that purpose has been an invaluable research tool, it is not without problems. In the case of HCCI combustion, the violent rates of heat release make the signal derived from pressure transducers more prone to thermal shock. In addition, in HCCI research, it is often necessary to establish the TRG amount as accurately as possible. However, TRG presence also complicates pegging techniques. Since the pressure transducer signal can be compromised by these calibration issues, it is prudent to try to address these issues when dealing with pressure signals derived during HCCI operation. The present article presents an algorithm aiming to account for these calibration issues surrounding the use of pressure transducers in HCCI research. Results for the TRG amount and initial mixture composition and temperature on a cycle-to-cycle basis are also derived...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} <b>misfire</b> <b>detection.</b> In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). <b>Misfire</b> <b>detection</b> constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for <b>misfire</b> <b>detection.</b> The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

40|$|Our society {{depends on}} {{advanced}} and complex technical systems and machines, for example, cars for transportation, industrial robots in production lines, satellites for communication, and power plants for energy production. Consequences of a fault {{in such a}} system can be severe and result in human casualties, environmentally harmful emissions, high repair costs, or economical losses caused by unexpected stops in production lines. Thus, a diagnosis system is important, and in some applications also required by legislations, to monitor the system health {{in order to take}} appropriate preventive actions when a fault occurs. Important properties of diagnosis systems are their capability of detecting and identifying faults, i. e., their fault detectability and isolability performance. This thesis deals with quantitative analysis of fault detectability and isolability performance when taking model uncertainties and measurement noise into consideration. The goal is to analyze diagnosability performance given a mathematical model of the system to be monitored before a diagnosis system is developed. A measure of fault diagnosability performance, called distinguishability, is proposed based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. For linear descriptor models with Gaussian noise, distinguishability gives an upper limit for the fault to noise ratio of any linear residual generator. Distinguishability is used to analyze fault detectability and isolability performance of a non-linear mean value engine model of gas flows in a heavy duty diesel engine by linearizing the model around different operating points. It is also shown how distinguishability is used for determine sensor placement, i. e, where sensors should be placed in a system to achieve a required fault diagnosability performance. The sensor placement problem is formulated as an optimization problem, where minimum required diagnosability performance is used as a constraint. Results show that the required diagnosability performance greatly affects which sensors to use, which is not captured if not model uncertainties and measurement noise are taken into consideration. Another problem considered here is the on-line sequential test selection problem. Distinguishability is used to quantify the performance of the different test quantities. The set of test quantities is changed on-line, depending on the output of the diagnosis system. Instead of using all test quantities the whole time, changing the set of active test quantities can be used to maintain a required diagnosability performance while reducing the computational cost of the diagnosis system. Results show that the number of used test quantities can be greatly reduced while maintaining a good fault isolability performance. A quantitative diagnosability analysis has been used during the design of an engine <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm based on the estimated torque at the flywheel.

40|$|The area of <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> is {{important}} because {{of the effects of}} misfires on both the environment and the exhaust system. Increasing requirements on the detection performance means that improvements are always of interest. In this thesis, potential improvements to an existing <b>misfire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm are evaluated. The improvements evaluated are: using Gaussian processes to model the classifier, alternative signal treatments for detection of multiple misfires, and effects of where flywheel tooth angle error estimation is performed. The improvements are also evaluated for their suitability for use on-line. Both the use of Gaussian processes and the detection of multiple misfires are hard problems to solve while maintaining detection performance. Gaussian processes most likely loses performance due to loss of dependence between the weights of the classifier. It can give performance similar to the original classifier, but with greatly increased complexity. For multiple misfires, the performance can be slightly improved without loss of single misfire performance. Greater improvements are possible, but at the cost of single misfire performance. The decision is in the end down to the desired trade-off. The flywheel tooth angle error compensation gives nearly identical performance regardless of where it is estimated. Consequently the error estimation can be separated from the signal processing, allowing the implementation to be modular. Using an EKF for estimating the flywheel errors on-line is found to be both feasible and give good performance. Combining the separation of the error estimation from the signal treatment with a, after initial convergence, heavily restricted EKF gives a vastly reduced computational load for only a moderate loss of performance...|$|E

Analyzing which faults that can be detected and isolated given the model gives useful information when designing a diagnosis system. This information can be used, for example, to determine which residual generators can be generated or to select a sufficient set of sensors {{that can be used}} to detect and isolate the faults. With more information about the system taken into consideration during such an analysis, more accurate estimations can be computed of how good fault detectability and isolability that can be achieved. Model uncertainties and measurement noise are the main reasons for reduced fault detection and isolation performance and can make it difficult to design a diagnosis system that fulfills given performance requirements. By taking information about different uncertainties into consideration early in the development process of a diagnosis system, it is possible to predict how good performance can be achieved by a diagnosis system and avoid bad design choices. This thesis deals with quantitative analysis of fault detectability and isolability performance when taking model uncertainties and measurement noise into consideration. The goal is to analyze fault detectability and isolability performance given a mathematical model of the monitored system before a diagnosis system is developed. A quantitative measure of fault detectability and isolability performance for a given model, called distinguishability, is proposed based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The distinguishability measure answers questions like "How difficult is it to isolate a fault fi from another fault fj?. Different properties of the distinguishability measure are analyzed. It is shown for example, that for linear descriptor models with Gaussian noise, distinguishability gives an upper limit for the fault to noise ratio of any linear residual generator. The proposed measure is used for quantitative analysis of a nonlinear mean value model of gas flows in a heavy-duty diesel engine to analyze how fault diagnosability performance varies for different operating points. It is also used to formulate the sensor selection problem, i. e., to find a cheapest set of available sensors that should be used in a system to achieve required fault diagnosability performance.

40|$|Even {{though a}} lot of {{research}} has gone into diagnosing misfire in IC engines, most approaches use torsional vibration of the crankshaft, and only a few use the rocking motion (roll) of the engine block. Additionally, misfire diagnosis normally requires an expert to interpret the analysis results from measured vibration signals. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are potential tools for the automated misfire diagnosis of IC engines, as they can learn the patterns corresponding to various faults. This paper proposes an ANN-based automated diagnostic system which combines torsional vibration and rotation of the block for more robust misfire diagnosis. A critical issue with ANN applications is the network training, and it is improbable and/or uneconomical to expect to experience a sufficient number of different faults, or generate them in seeded tests, to obtain sufficient experimental results for the network training. Therefore, new simulation models, which can simulate combustion faults in engines, were developed. The simulation models are based on the thermodynamic and mechanical principles of IC engines and therefore the proposed misfire diagnostic system can in principle be adapted for any engine. During the building process of the models, based on a particular engine, some mechanical and physical parameters, for example the inertial properties of the engine parts and parameters of engine mounts, were first measured and calculated. A series of experiments were then carried out to capture the vibration signals for both normal condition and with a range of faults. The simulation models were updated and evaluated by the experimental results. Following the signal processing of the experimental and simulation signals, the best features were selected as the inputs to ANN networks. The automated diagnostic system comprises three stages: <b>misfire</b> <b>detection,</b> misfire localization and severity identification.

Therefore, developing accurate vehicle models has become significantly important. The powertrain system, which transfers the engine torque to the driving wheels, {{is one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle. Having a reliable methodology, for modeling and parameter estimation of a powertrain structure, helps predict different kinds of behaviors such as torsional vibration which is beneficial for a number of applications in automotive industry. Examples of such cases are ride quality evaluation and model-based fault detection. This thesis uses the knowledge from the system identification field, which introduces the methods of building mathematical models for dynamical systems based on experimental data, to model the torsional vibration of an engine-load setup. It is a subsystem of the vehicular powertrain and the main source of vibration is the engine fluctuating torque. The challenges are handling a more complicated model structure with a greater number of unknown parameters as well as showing the importance of data information for acquiring better identification performance. Since the engine-load setup is modeled physically here, its state-space equations are available and a grey-box modeling approach can be applied in which the well-known prediction error method is used toestimate the unknown physical parameters. Moreover, a structural  identifiability analysis is performed which shows that all of the model parameters are identifiable assuming informative input. Two main aspects are considered to present an appropriate modeling methodology. The first is simplification of the model structure according to frequency range of interest. This is achieved by performing modal shape analysis to obtain how many degrees-of-freedom are necessary at different frequency ranges. The results show that a 7 degrees-of-freedom model can be simplified to a 2 degrees-offreedom structure and still have the desired performance for a specific application such as <b>misfire</b> <b>detection.</b> The second aspect concerns using an appropriate data set, which has the required information for estimation of the unknown parameters. By analyzing the simulation data from a known system, it is shown that the parameters of the 2 degrees-of-freedom model can not be estimated accurately using measurements from a normal combustion data set. However, all the parameters except damping coefficient converge to their true values by using a data set which has misfire in the input torque from the engine. A high estimation variance plus flat loss function indicate that the damping coefficient has no significant influence on the model output and consequently can not be estimated correctly using the available measurements. Thus, to increase the accuracy of the results during estimation on real data, the damping coefficient(s) is assumed to be known. Both the 2 and 7 degrees-of-freedom models are validated against a fresh data set and it is shown that the simulated output captures the important parts of the actual system behavior depending on the application of interest.
