5000|$|Liver {{and onions}} is a dish {{consisting}} of slices of liver (usually pork, beef or, in the United Kingdom, lamb) and onions; onion is favoured as an accompaniment to liver as the flavour of onion [...] "cuts" [...] the somewhat <b>metallic</b> <b>flavour</b> of liver, {{which can be}} off-putting to some eaters. The liver and the onions are usually fried or cooked together, but sometimes they may be fried separately and mixed together afterwards. The liver is often cut in fine slices, but it also may be diced.|$|E
40|$|We used 12 males {{suckling}} lambs from Ojinegra de Teruel, slaughtered at 10, 6 kg {{live weight}} to study its sensory characteristics {{in comparison to}} PGI “Lechazo de Castilla y León” meat quality. At 24 h post-mortem, L. lumborum were excised, vacuum packed and frozen. 8 members trained panel evaluated lamb’s odour intensity, fat odour intensity, wood odour intensity, tenderness, juiciness, fibrosity, lamb’s flavour intensity, fat flavour intensity, <b>metallic</b> <b>flavour</b> intensity acid flavour intensity, bitter flavour intensity and overall liking using a nonstructured 100 -point scale. No differences were found for any of studied characteristics except for wood odour intensity that showed a tendency to signification, being lower in Ojinegra de Teruel Lambs. This kind of meat can show a good appreciation in the market...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{different}} slaughter weights (160 vs. 120 kg) on chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of pig loin were investigated. Physical and chemical traits were similar {{for the two}} typologies of weight, whereas lower values of moisture (P< 0. 01) and higher fat content (P< 0. 05) were found in heavy pork loin; furthermore increased slaughter weight resulted in redder, more yellow and intensive colour (P< 0. 05). A selected and trained panel carried out difference from control test showing that heavy pig loin scored higher for appearance and taste parameters (P< 0. 05), but lower for tenderness (P< 0. 05). Heavy pig loin was redder, more marbling, wetter, sweeter, and saltier and had higher <b>metallic</b> <b>flavour</b> and lower tenderness...|$|E
500|$|Off-flavours can {{sometimes}} develop during {{the production of}} maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation products, <b>metallic</b> can <b>flavours,</b> and [...] "buddy sap", an off-flavour occurring late in the syrup season when tree budding has begun. In some circumstances, {{it is possible to}} remove off-flavours through processing.|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} fish oils are generally attributed to their content of long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Diets rich in these fatty acids {{are known to}} reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis, and are recommended to those who are susceptible to atherosclerosis. In addition, some of these long chain PUFAs play an important role in early infant nutrition, in the development of vital human organs such as the neural tube. However, practical difficulties arise in achieving an adequate daily intake of fish oils to obtain these physiological benefits. Per capita fish consumption is low in many countries, especially of oily fish with high levels of omega- 3 PUFAs. Fish oil, while available as a dietary supplement, is not universally appealing in that form. Attempts to incorporate fish oil into food formulations have had limited success mainly because of fishy flavours coming through in the consumer products. Fish oil is particularly susceptible to oxidation, which results in fishy, painty and <b>metallic</b> <b>flavours.</b> Hence the main aim of this study was the development of a dried ingredient in which the formulation and related processing conditions were optimised to protect the fish oil from oxidation. Protection of any sensitive oil may be achieved by means of microencapsulation, whereby oil is dispersed as very fine droplets in emulsions. During subsequent spray drying the droplets are effectively sealed inside a protective coating of protein surrounded by carbohydrate. The objective was, therefore, to evaluate microencapsulation as a means of extending the shelf-life of fish oil in powder form thus increasing its versatility as a nutritional ingredient in food formulations.

40|$|Oral {{nutrition}} supplements (ONS) {{are routinely}} prescribed to those with, or at risk of, malnutrition. Previous research identified poor compliance due {{to taste and}} sweetness. This paper investigates taste and hedonic liking of ONS, of varying sweetness and metallic levels, over consumption volume; an important consideration as patients are prescribed large volumes of ONS daily. A sequential descriptive profile was developed to determine the perception of sensory attributes over repeat consumption of ONS. Changes in liking of ONS following repeat consumption were characterised by a boredom test. Certain <b>flavour</b> (<b>metallic</b> taste, soya milk flavour) and mouthfeel (mouthdrying, mouthcoating) attributes built up over increased consumption volume (p 0. 002). Hedonic liking data from two cohorts, healthy older volunteers (n = 32, median age 73) and patients (n = 28, median age 85), suggested such build-up was disliked. Efforts made to improve the palatability of ONS must {{take account of the}} build up of taste and mouthfeel characteristics over increased consumption volume. ...|$|R
30|$|Sensory {{analysis}} and the volatile profile of IR 64 were both {{affected by the}} drought treatment. Biochemical changes in the grain may explain much of this, either due to changes in gene expression in the grain, or changes to the regulation of source-sink transport from the plant to the grain. In IR 64 grains from the drought treatment, sweetness was decreased and a water-like <b>metallic</b> <b>flavour</b> was detected which was absent in grains from the irrigated treatment. Though we cannot demonstrate {{the role of the}} underlying metabolic processes in this study, we have linked the stress caused by drought to changes in the metabolite pattern, and therefore the flavour profile of IR 64. Samples of Apo from both irrigated and drought fields were indistinguishable in their characterisation by water-like metallic, sewer/animal, and hay-like/musty aromas at high levels. One previous study has investigated the effect of drainage on the sensory aroma of rice and the variety used in that study showed no difference in flavour/aroma compounds (Champagne et al. 2005). Our data suggest that a response to moisture stress in the metabolomic profile of the grain is variety dependent, as is often observed in crops e.g., fruit response to water stress that is cultivar dependent (Giné Bordonaba and Terry 2010). Understanding different varietal responses and determining the basis of stress response is important in developing climate-ready varieties.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of four different production systems (thereafter, treatment) on lamb meat sensory characteristic {{measured by a}} trained panel test was analysed. The treatments were: INT, lambs were kept indoor with free access to concentrate while dams were only indoor from 15 : 00 to 08 : 00 h. EST, lambs and ewes were kept indoor with free access to concentrate. GR, lambs and ewes grazed alfalfa without concentrate, GR+S, animals grazed alfalfa and lambs had cereal supplement. Lambs from DRL-GRE and DRL were weaned at 45 days old. Six entire male lambs from each treatment were slaughtered at 20 - 22 kg live weight and theirs carcasses were cooled at 4 °C. At 24 hours post mortem, Longissimus lumborum were excised, vaccum packed and aged for a total period of three days. Samples were grilled to an internal temperature of 70 cC. A trained nine-member panel valued lamb odour intensity, tenderness, juiciness, lamb flavour intensity, liver flavour intensity, fat flavor intensity, <b>metallic</b> <b>flavour</b> intensity and overall liking using a 1 O-point scale. An ANOVA procedure, means and standard deviation for each attribute in each treatment and Pearson correlation analysis were carried using SPSS v. l 3. 0 software. No differences between treatments were found for any variable. All variables were closely related one each others. Overall liking {{was positively correlated with}} tenderness and juiciness and negatively correlated with liver, fat or metallic flavours. From a sensorial point of view, alfalfa grazing is a workable alternative to traditional concentrate feeding for rearing lambs...|$|E
40|$|The air turned chilly {{as the sun}} sighed {{into the}} nearby hills. It picked up the smells of dust mixed with <b>metallic</b> and dung <b>flavours.</b> Miss Phaeng watched, holding her breath as the last sliver of red fell out of sight. Casting a quick mantra to the spirits of nature, she {{swallowed}} a glass of lao lao to start the evening. Leaning mindfully over her loom, Miss Phaeng raked her nails across the piano strings of silk warp, plucking each to test its tension. A black sheet of pin-straight hair fell over her face, hiding the claret birthmark shaped just like a spider, that crept over her right cheek, one leg disappearing into the fine hairs of her temple. The coarse ivory silk recently spooled from the cocoons gathered in her garden pushed back against her hand. She felt the fizz of anticipation low in her belly as she gathered all the many shuttles holding the weft silk and dumped them into an old blackened basket. Inhaling its heady stink of ash, grass and smoke, she placed the basket next to where she would sit. Melody Kemp offers {{a close look at}} the Lao silk industry...|$|R
