Opposition to the bill included otherwise ANC-aligned groups such as COSATU. Notably, Nelson Mandela and other Nobel laureates Nadine Gordimer, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and F. W. de Klerk have expressed disappointment with the bill for not <b>meeting</b> <b>standards</b> of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression.|$|E
2500|$|Number {{plates were}} {{initially}} {{made by the}} motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates <b>meeting</b> <b>standards</b> could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs {{to confirm that the}} customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity. The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown {{at the bottom of the}} plate. Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. [...] These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).|$|E
2500|$|Water {{bodies that}} do not meet {{applicable}} water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not <b>meeting</b> <b>standards.</b> Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of {{the maximum amount of}} a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS. [...] The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS) [...] Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. [...] Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.|$|E

During the 2014-2015 school year, ELARA's 11th grade class taking the CAASPP resulted with 11% exceeding the <b>standard,</b> 26% <b>meeting</b> the <b>standard,</b> 37% nearly <b>meeting</b> the <b>standard,</b> and 26% not <b>meeting</b> the <b>standard</b> in English Language Arts/Literacy. 2% exceeded the standard, 7% met the standard, 24% nearly met the standard, and 67% did not meet the standard in Mathematics.

2500|$|Water {{quality has}} {{improved}} and, partially {{in recognition of}} this improvement, the Cuyahoga was designated one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998. Despite these efforts, pollution continues {{to exist in the}} Cuyahoga River due to other sources of pollution, including urban runoff, nonpoint source problems, combined sewer overflows, and stagnation due to water impounded by dams. For this reason, the Environmental Protection Agency classified portions of the Cuyahoga River watershed as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The most polluted portions of the river now generally meet established aquatic life water quality standards except near dam impoundments. The reasons for not <b>meeting</b> <b>standards</b> near the dam pools are habitat and fish passage issues rather than water quality. River reaches that were once devoid of fish now support 44 species. The most recent survey in 2008 revealed the two most common species in the river were hogsuckers and spotfin shiners, both moderately sensitive to water quality. Habitat issues within the [...] navigation channel still preclude a robust fishery in that reach. Recreation water quality standards (using bacteria as indicators) are generally met during dry weather conditions, but are often exceeded during significant rains due to nonpoint sources and combined sewer overflows.|$|E
