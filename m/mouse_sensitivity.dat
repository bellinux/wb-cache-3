From most hybrid lines {{it was possible}} to select sublines resistant to emetine. The ribosomal components of three lines were studied: A 34, an emetine-sensitive hybrid; A 34 /R 3, an emetine-resistant derivative of A 34; and A 72, an emetine-sensitive hybrid that did not give rise to emetine-resistant sublines. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that in A 34 both the <b>mouse</b> emetine <b>sensitivity</b> gene and the hamster emetine resistance gene are active, whereas in A 34 /R 3 only the hamster emetine resistance gene is active and in A 72 only the <b>mouse</b> emetine <b>sensitivity</b> gene is active. The ribosomes of all three sublines contained both mouse and hamster RNA, predominantly mouse. However, the 60 S subunits had roughly equal amounts of the three mouse and hamster proteins that could be distinguished by two-dimensional electrophoresis, suggesting the association of mouse RNA with hamster ribosomal proteins. The emetine-resistant and emetine-sensitive 40 S subunits could be separated by sedimentation in 0. 5 M KCl. Resistant subunits contained predominantly mouse RNA, presumably associated with the hamster protein conferring emetine resistance.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} complement protein factor B (Bf) and alternative pathway activity in vivo, and to test the hypothesized potential genetic lethal effect of Bf deficiency, the murine Bf gene was interrupted by exchange of exon 3 through exon 7 (including the factor D cleaving site) with the neor gene. Mice heterozygous for the targeted Bf allele were interbred, yielding Bf-deficient offspring after the F 1 generation at a frequency suggesting that Bf deficiency alone has no major effect on fertility or fetal development. However, {{in the context of}} one or more genes derived from the 129 mouse strain, offspring homozygous for Bf deficiency were generated at less than expected numbers (P = 0. 012). Bf-deficient mice showed no gross phenotypic difference from wild-type littermates. Sera from Bf-deficient mice lacked detectable alternative complement pathway activity; purified mouse Bf overcame the deficit. Classical pathway-dependent total hemolytic activity was lower in Bf-deficient than wild-type mice, possibly reflecting loss of the alternative pathway amplification loop. Lymphoid organ structure and IgG 1 antibody response to a T-dependent antigen appeared normal in Bf-deficient <b>mice.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to lethal endotoxic shock was not significantly altered in Bf-deficient mice.

Seventeen type 1 poliovirus isolates were recovered from stools taken from this child during the following 4 months. Contrary to expectation, the child was not deficient in humoral immunity and showed high levels of serum neutralization against poliovirus. Selected virus isolates were characterized in terms of their antigenic properties, virulence in transgenic <b>mice,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for growth at high temperatures, and differences in nucleotide sequence from the Sabin type 1 strain. The VDPV isolates showed mutations at key nucleotide positions that correlated with the observed reversion to biological properties typical of wild polioviruses. A number of capsid mutations mapped at known antigenic sites leading to changes in the viral antigenic structure. Estimates of sequence evolution based on the accumulation of nucleotide changes in the VP 1 coding region detected a “defective” molecular clock running at an apparent faster speed of 2. 05 % nucleotide changes per year versus 1 % shown in previous studies. Remarkably, when compared to several type 1 VDPV strains of different origins, isolates from this child showed a much higher proportion of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide changes in the capsid coding region. This anomaly could explain the high VP 1 sequence drift found and the ability of these virus strains to replicate in the gut for a longer period than expected...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe P 4 {{promoter}} of the autonomous parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) drives {{the production of}} its non-structural proteins, NS 1 and NS 2.

40|$|Systemic drug {{delivery}} to solid tumors involving macromolecular therapeutic agents is challenging for many reasons. Amongst them is their chaotic microvasculature which {{often leads to}} inadequate and uneven uptake of the drug. Localized {{drug delivery}} can circumvent such obstacles and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) - controlled infusion of the drug directly into the tissue- {{has emerged as a}} promising delivery method for distributing macromolecules over larger tissue volumes. In this study, a three-dimensional MR image-based computational porous media transport model accounting for realistic anatomical geometry and tumor leakiness was developed for predicting the interstitial flow field and distribution of albumin tracer following CED into the hind-limb tumor (KHT sarcoma) in a <b>mouse.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> of the model to changes in infusion flow rate, catheter placement and tissue hydraulic conductivity were investigated. The model predictions suggest that 1) tracer distribution is asymmetric due to heterogeneous porosity; 2) tracer distribution volume varies linearly with infusion volume within the whole leg, and exponentially within the tumor reaching a maximum steady-state value; 3) infusion {{at the center of the}} tumor with high flow rates leads to maximum tracer coverage in the tumor with minimal leakage outside; and 4) increasing the tissue hydraulic conductivity lowers the tumor interstitial fluid pressure and decreases the tracer distribution volume within the whole leg and tumor. The model thus predicts that the interstitial fluid flow and drug transport is sensitive to porosity and changes in extracellular space. This image-based model thus serves as a potentia...|$|E
40|$|The type 1 {{cannabinoid}} receptor (CB 1) modulates numerous neurobehavioral processes {{and is therefore}} explored as a target {{for the treatment of}} several mental and neurological diseases. However, previous studies have investigated CB 1 by targeting it globally, regardless of its two main neuronal localizations on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. In the context of cocaine addiction this lack of selectivity is critical since glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal transmission is involved in different aspects of the disease. To determine whether CB 1 exerts different control on cocaine seeking according to its two main neuronal localizations, we used mutant mice with deleted CB 1 in cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB 1) or in forebrain GABAergic neurons (GABA-CB 1). In Glu-CB 1, gene deletion concerns the dorsal telencephalon, including neocortex, paleocortex, archicortex, hippocampal formation and the cortical portions of the amygdala. In GABA-CB 1, it concerns several cortical and non-cortical areas including the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamic, and hypothalamic nuclei. We tested complementary components of cocaine self-administration, separating the influence of primary and conditioned effects. Mechanisms underlying each phenotype were explored using in vivo microdialysis and ex vivo electrophysiology. We show that CB 1 expression in forebrain GABAergic neurons controls <b>mouse</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to cocaine, while CB 1 expression in cortical glutamatergic neurons controls associative learning processes. In accordance, in the nucleus accumbens, GABA-CB 1 receptors control cocaine-induced dopamine release and Glu-CB 1 receptors control AMPAR/NMDAR ratio; a marker of synaptic plasticity. Our findings demonstrate a critical distinction of the altered balance of Glu-CB 1 and GABA-CB 1 activity that could participate in the vulnerability to cocaine abuse and addiction. Moreover, these novel insights advance our understanding of CB 1 neuropathophysiology.

40|$|The {{peptide hormone}} relaxin has {{striking}} {{effects on the}} vascular system. Specifically, endogenous relaxin treatment reduces myogenic reactivity through nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vasorelaxation and increases arterial compliance in small resistance arteries. However, less {{is known about the}} vascular roles of endogenous relaxin, particularly in males. Therefore, we used male wild-type (Rln+/+) and relaxin knockout (Rln-/-) mice to test the hypothesis that passive wall properties and vascular reactivity in mesenteric arteries would be compromised in Rln-/- mice. Passive compliance was determined in arteries (n= 8 - 9) mounted on a pressure myograph and in Ca 2 +-free Krebs containing 2 mM EGTA. Passive volume compliance was significantly (P= 0. 01) decreased in the mesenteric arteries of Rln-/- mice. Vascular reactivity was assessed using wire myography. In mesenteric arteries (n= 5) of Rln-/- mice, there was a significant (P< 0. 03) increase in sensitivity to the vasoconstrictors phenylephrine and thromboxane-mimetic U 41669. This enhanced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors was abolished by endothelial denudation, and attributed to impaired NO and prostanoid pathways in Rln-/- <b>mice.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to the endothelial agonist acetylcholine was significantly (n= 7 - 9, P ≤ 0. 03) decreased, and this was abolished {{in the presence of the}} cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (2 µM).

In summary, we demonstrate endothelial dysfunction and impaired arterial wall remodeling in male mice deficient in relaxin.

Therefore new models are urgently needed to investigate this deadly disease. As {{a part of this}} process we have established and characterized a new human pancreatic cancer cell line. Methods The newly established pancreatic cancer cell line PaCa 5061 was characterized for its morphology, growth rate, chromosomal analysis and mutational analysis of the K- ras, EGFR and p 53 genes. Gene-amplification and RNA expression profiles were obtained using an Affymetrix microarray, and overexpression was validated by IHC analysis. Tumorigenicity and spontaneous metastasis formation of PaCa 5061 cells were analyzed in pfp -/- /rag 2 -/- <b>mice.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> towards chemotherapy was analysed by MTT assay. Results PaCa 5061 cells grew as an adhering monolayer with a doubling time ranging from 30 to 48 hours. M-FISH analyses showed a hypertriploid complex karyotype with multiple numerical and unbalanced structural aberrations. Numerous genes were overexpressed, some of which have previously been implicated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (GATA 6, IGFBP 3, IGFBP 6), while others were detected for the first time (MEMO 1, RIOK 3). Specifically highly overexpressed genes (fold change > 10) were identified as EGFR, MUC 4, CEACAM 1, CEACAM 5 and CEACAM 6. Subcutaneous transplantation of PaCa 5061 into pfp -/- /rag 2 -/- mice resulted in formation of primary tumors and spontaneous lung metastasis.

40|$|Putative dopaminergic (pDAergic) {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) neurons have an {{important}} role in alcohol addiction. Acute ethanol increases the activity of pDAergic neurons, and withdrawal from repeated ethanol administration produces a decreased sensitivity of pDAergic VTA neurons to GABA. Recent studies show that behavioral changes induced by chronic alcohol are reversed by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Whether HDAC-induced histone modifications regulate changes in GABA sensitivity of VTA pDAergic neurons during withdrawal is unknown. Here, we investigated modulation of withdrawal-induced changes in GABA sensitivity of pDAergic VTA neurons by HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), and also measured the levels of HDAC 2, histone (H 3 -K 9) acetylation, and GABA-Aa 1 receptor (GABA (A-a 1) R) subunit in VTA during ethanol withdrawal. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with either ethanol (3. 5 g/kg) or saline twice daily for 3 weeks. In recordings from pDAergic VTA neurons in brain slices from ethanol-withdrawn <b>mice,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to GABA (50 - 500 卩 was reduced. In brain slices from ethanol-withdrawn mice incubated with the HDACi SAHA (vorinostat) or trichostatin A (TSA) for 2 h, the hyposensitivity of pDAergic VTA neurons to GABA was significantly attenuated. There was no effect of TSA or SAHA on GABA sensitivity of pDAergic VTA neurons from saline-treated mice. In addition, ethanol withdrawal was associated with an increase in levels of HDAC 2 and a decrease in histone (H 3 -K 9) acetylation and levels of GABA (A-a 1) R subunits in the VTA. Therefore, blockade of upregulation of HDAC 2 by HDACi normalizes GABA hyposensitivity of pDAergic neurons developed during withdrawal after chronic ethanol treatment, which suggests the possibility that inhibition of HDACs can reverse ethanol-induced neuroadaptational changes in reward circuitry.

Biparatopic MAb was prepared by using cross-linking of reduced Fab' fragments from PR 1 A 3 and T 84. 66. Fifty-nine tumors from 2 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines with high (KM- 12 c) and low (Clone A) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression were successfully implanted subcutaneously on the backs of 42 nude mice. Tumors were localized using 125 I-labeled MAbs: IgG, F(ab') (2) and Fab' of PR 1 A 3, and biparatopic MAb of PR 1 A 3 and T 84. 66. Radioactivity counted on a portable radioisotope detector correlated well with that counted on a gamma counter (p < 0. 001). Accumulations of radioactivity in control mice without tumorigenesis were the greatest in PR 1 A 3 IgG-pretreated mice and the least in biparatopic MAb-pretreated mice. Tumors of 2 cell lines did not differ in the distribution of radiolabeled MAbs. Localization indices of the tumor in various organs revealed 1. 3 to 4. 1 in PR 1 A 3 IgG-pretreated mice, 2. 4 to 6. 6 in fragment MAbs of PR 1 A 3 -pretreated mice and 2 to 4. 6 in biparatopic MAb-pretreated mice.

Four isolates, including the type culture of C. stellatoidea, belonged to electrophoretic karyotype type I by OFAGE, showing eight to nine bands of which at least two bands were less than 1, 000 kilobases in size as estimated by comparison with the DNA bands of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These isolates failed to produce fatal infection in mice within 20 days when 5 X 10 (5) cells were injected intravenously. The yeasts were cleared from the kidneys of two of three mice tested by day 30. Type I showed proteinase activity on bovine serum albumin agar at pH 3. 8 and produced a negative reaction on cycloheximide-bromcresol green medium within 48 h. The three grouped in type II by OFAGE showed banding patterns {{similar to those of}} a well-characterized isolate of Candida albicans. The isolates of type II had an electrophoretic karyotype of six to seven bands approximately 1, 200 kilobases or greater in size. All three type II isolates were highly virulent for mice, producing fatality curves similar to those of a previously studied C. albicans isolate. From 80 to 90 % of the mice injected with 5 X 10 (5) cells intravenously died within 20 days. The type II isolates produced a positive reaction on cycloheximide-bromcresol green agar and showed no proteinase activity on bovine serum albumin agar at the low pH.

40|$|The anti-influenzal {{activity}} of ribavirin and amantadine hydrochloride {{has been compared}} in different test systems. Strains belonging to the four A sub-types H 0 N 1, H 1 N 1, H 2 N 2 and H 3 N 2 were employed. Although some variation was found between systems, the four strains {{were found to be}} of similar sensitivity to ribavirin, the inhibitory {{activity of}} which differed very little from that of amantadine hydro-chloride with the more recent strains. In <b>mice</b> the <b>sensitivity</b> of the strains to the two compounds appeared to decrease with increasing passage in the mouse lung up to the 30 th passage level. It is suggested that ribavirin should be used as a tool to check that viruses are similarly adapted to mice, particularly for strains which are not very sensitive to amantadine hydrochloride...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stem {{cells of}} normal tissues have {{resistance}} mechanisms {{that allow them}} to survive genotoxic insults. The stem cell-like cells of tumors are defined by their tumor-initiating capacity and may have retained these resistance mechanisms, making them resistant to chemotherapy. We studied the relationship between resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan and tumor-initiating potential in human colonosphere cultures and in mice with colorectal xenograft tumors. METHODS: Colonosphere cultures were established from human colorectal tumor specimens obtained from patients who underwent colon or liver resection for primary or metastatic adenocarcinoma. Stem cell and differentiation markers were analyzed by immunoblotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Clone- and tumor-initiating capacities were assessed by single-cell cloning and in immune-deficient <b>mice.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to irinotecan was assessed in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice. The relationship between drug resistance and tumor-initiating capacity was tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of colonosphere cells, based on expression of ABCB 1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. RESULTS: Colonosphere cultures had a high capacity to initiate tumors in mice and were resistant to irinotecan. Inhibition of the drug-efflux pump ABCB 1 by PSC- 833 allowed irinotecan to eradicate tumor-initiating cells. However, ABCB 1 was expressed only by a subpopulation of differentiated tumor cells that did not form clones or tumors. Conversely, tumor-initiating cells were ABCB 1 -negative and were identified by high ALDH activity. Tumorigenic ALDHhigh/ABCB 1 negative cells generated nontumorigenic ALDHlow/ABCB 1 positive daughter cells in vitro and in tumor xenografts. PSC- 833 increased the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan in mice. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance of colorectal tumors to irinotecan requires the cooperative action of tumor-initiating ALDHhigh/ABCB 1 negative cells and their differentiated, drug-expelling, ALDHlow/ABCB 1 positive daughter cells.

40|$|The {{response}} of hair follicle melanoblasts to irradiation {{has been studied}} by two techniques at various stages of the hair growth cycle. Scoring of follicles without functional melanocytes in a growth phase after irradiation provides dose-response curves that have similarities to earlier depigmentation results. Melanoblast survival curves can also be obtained by scoring follicles with clones of functional melanocytes in a post-irradiation growth phase. A large difference in sensitivity is evident between resting and growing follicles. This difference seems to vary with different strains of <b>mice.</b> The <b>sensitivities</b> of the melanoblast survival curves also vary considerably through the hair growth cycle. The most sensitive cells are the resting Go melanoblasts. The dividing melanoblasts are more resistant, and the resistance is even greater, if the response is studied five days after plucking when the melanoblasts are reaching {{the end of the}} division phase {{and the beginning of the}} melanin synthetic phase...|$|R
