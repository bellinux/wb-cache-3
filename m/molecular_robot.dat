40|$|AbstractVarious {{artificial}} molecular devices, {{including some}} made of DNA or RNA, {{have been developed}} to date. The next step in this area of research is to develop an integrated system from such molecular devices. A <b>molecular</b> <b>robot</b> consists of sensors, computers, and actuators, all made of molecular devices, and reacts autonomously to its environment by observing the environment, making decisions with its computers, and performing actions upon the environment. Molecular computers should thus be the intelligent controllers of such molecular robots. Such controllers can naturally be regarded as hybrid systems because the environment, the robot, and the controller are all state transition systems having discrete and continuous states and transitions. For modeling and designing hybrid systems, formal frameworks, such as hybrid automata, are commonly used. In this perspective paper, we examine how molecular controllers can be modeled as hybrid automata and how they can be realized in a <b>molecular</b> <b>robot.</b> We first summarize the requirements for such molecular controllers and examine existing frameworks of DNA computing with respect to these requirements. We then show the possibility of combining existing frameworks of DNA computing to implement a sample hybrid controller for a <b>molecular</b> <b>robot...</b>|$|E

The key components of this robot are nucleic acid enzymes regulated allosterically by glucose. In the presence of glucose above a threshold level the robot moves, releasing insulin from a lawn covered with insulin, but stops in its tracks whenever glucose decreases to a level below threshold; thus, the robot could provide an insulin release response to spikes in glucose concentration in real time...|$|E

In our opinion, our model bears great potentialities for further extensions. We have treated robot molecules with one leg. Molecules with several legs, even showing different gaits {{can be dealt with}} in a similar way. A steering of the quantized signal field allows us to manipulate various configurations of the multi <b>molecular</b> <b>robot</b> system. Further, the excitation of the biological substrate by external signals opens a new bio-hybrid method to control the substrate from outside if it shows e. g. special kinds of mal-functioning.

40|$|Brownian {{motion is}} the {{apparently}} random motion of small particles {{in a solution}} that results from the bombardment of molecules within the solution. The theoretical understanding of this motion was developed by Einstein in the early 1900 s. Since then, features of Brownian motion, such {{as the fact that}} Brownian motion can be modeled using a random walk, or the fact that ensemble mean squared displacement (MSD) can be used to determine a diffusion coefficient and type of diffusive behavior, have been utilized to characterize a vast array of systems that are both naturally occurring and synthetic. 	In this thesis, I characterize three different types of systems using features of Brownian motion: naturally occurring nuclear pore complexes, synthetic <b>molecular</b> <b>robots</b> that are based on naturally occurring bipedal molecular walkers, and synthetic conductive nanoporous antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO). For the nuclear pore complex, the diffusion of particles through each region of the complex was modeled using a random walk in order to help determine the relative diffusion coefficients of the three regions. For the <b>molecular</b> <b>robots,</b> the movement of the robots was modeled using a more advanced random-walk simulation that utilizes the Gillespie algorithm; the movement of the robots was evaluated based on the MSDs, and the results were used to characterize the directional bias in the walking mechanism of the robots. For the ATO, fluorescent particles were monitored as they underwent Brownian motion while diffusing through the nanopores; MSDs were used to determine that these particles are embedded in the nanopores and that the diffusion coefficient depended in an unexpected way on the potential applied across the material...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{programming}} {{is concerned with}} building synthetic nanoscale devices from molecules, which can be programmed to autonomously per-form a specific task. Several artifacts have been demonstrated experi-mentally, including DNA circuits that can compute a logic formula and <b>molecular</b> <b>robots</b> that can transport cargo. In view of their natural inter-face to biological components, many potential applications are envisaged, e. g. point-of-care diagnostics and targeted delivery of drugs. However, the inherent complexity of the resulting biochemical systems makes the manual process of designing such devices error-prone, requiring automated design support methodologies, analogous to design automation tools for digital systems. This paper gives {{an overview of the}} role that probabilis-tic modelling and verification techniques can play in designing, analysing, debugging and synthesising programmable molecular devices, and outlines the challenges in achieving automated verification and synthesis software technologies in this setting. ...|$|R

Based on this DNA specificity, various nanoscale DNA device and DNA structure have been reported. Attempts to design and implement chemical reaction circuits to serve as computational components in DNA computing. However, this approach is not always appropriate, given the physical properties of the actual chemical reactions. In order to introduce intelligence in <b>molecular</b> <b>robots,</b> {{it is important to}} explore various chemical reactions that might be more suitable for DNA computing. An oligodeoxynucleotide containing CNVK can photo-cross-link to a pyrimidine base in complementary DNA or RNA molecules within a few seconds of photoirradiation.

40|$|Remarkable {{biological}} {{examples of}} molecular robots are the proteins kinesin- 1 and dynein, which move and transport cargo down microtubule highways, e. g. of the axon, to final nerve nodes or along dendrites. They convert {{the energy of}} ATP hydrolysis into mechanical forces and can thereby push them forwards or backwards step by step. Such mechano-chemical cycles that generate conformal changes are essential for transport on all different types of substrate lanes. The step length of an individual <b>molecular</b> <b>robot</b> {{is a matter of}} nanometers but the dynamics of each individual step cannot be predicted with certainty (as it is a random process). Hence, our proposal is to involve the methods of quantum field theory (QFT) to describe an overall reliable, multi–robot system that is composed of a huge set of unreliable, local elements. The methods of QFT deliver techniques that are also computationally demanding to synchronize the motion of these molecular robots on one substrate lane as well as across lanes. Three different challenging types of solutions are elaborated. The impact solution reflects the particle point of view; the two remaining solutions are wave based. The second solution outlines coherent robot motions on different lanes. The third solution describes running waves. Experimental investigations are needed to clarify under which biological conditions such different solutions occur. Moreover, such a nano-chemical system can be stimulated by external signals, and this opens a new, hybrid approach to analyze and control the combined system of robots and microtubules externally. Such a method offers the chance to detect mal-functions of the biological system. In our framework, such defects can be characterized by the distortion of typical features of dynamic systems like attractive fixed points, limit cycles, etc. However, such additional details would overload this presentation and obscure the essentials that we wish to point out...|$|E
40|$|Traditional robots rely {{for their}} {{function}} on computing, to store internal representations of their goals and environment and to coordinate sensing and any actuation of components required in response. Moving robotics to the single-molecule level {{is possible in}} principle, but requires facing the limited ability of individual molecules to store complex information and programs. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use systems that can obtain complex behaviour from the interaction of simple robots with their environment. A first step in this direction was the development of DNA walkers, which have developed from being non-autonomous, to being capable of directed but brief motion on one-dimensional tracks. Here we demonstrate that previously developed random walkers—so-called molecular spiders that comprise a streptavidin molecule as an inert ‘body’ and three deoxyribozymes as catalytic ‘legs’—show elementary robotic behaviour when interacting with a precisely defined environment. Single-molecule microscopy observations confirm that such walkers achieve directional movement by sensing and modifying tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape. When using appropriately designed DNA origami, the molecular spiders autonomously carry out sequences of actions such as ‘start’, ‘follow’, ‘turn’ and ‘stop’. We anticipate that this strategy will result in more complex robotic behaviour {{at the molecular level}} if additional control mechanisms are incorporated. One example might be interactions between multiple <b>molecular</b> <b>robots</b> leading to collective behaviour; another might be the ability to read and transform secondary cues on the DNA origami landscape as a means of implementing Turing-universal algorithmic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), {{developed}} by MBARI researchers, is a field-deployable autonomous <b>molecular</b> biology <b>robot</b> that uses sandwich hybridization chemistry to identify target taxa by hybridizing field samples to a macroarray of nucleic acid probes. The current technology allows for identification and quantification {{of up to}} eight taxa at a time from a discrete plankton sample. Alternatively, advancements in microarray technology may allow for the examination of dozens of taxa from one discrete sample. Therefore, this work has focused on using microarrays to optimize the capacity of previous technology. As an experimental model, ESP sandwich hybridization chemistry was used to hybridize rRNA from cultured Pseudo-nitzchia australis with microarrays. Several of the sandwich hybridization conditions were optimized for microarray slides {{in order to increase}} signal intensity. This works shows that using microarrays to detect and, possibly, quantify marine microorganisms is a feasible research goal for the future...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{science and}} {{electrical}} engineering {{have been the}} great success story of the twentieth century. The neat modularity and mapping of a language onto circuits has led to robots on Mars, desktop computers and smartphones. But these devices are not yet able {{to do some of}} the things that life takes for granted: repair a scratch, reproduce, regenerate, or grow exponentially fast–all while remaining functional. This thesis explores and develops algorithms, molecular implementations, and theoretical proofs in the context of “active self-assembly” of molecular systems. The long-term vision of active self-assembly is the theoretical and physical implementation of materials that are composed of reconfigurable units with the programmability and adaptability of biology’s numerous molecular machines. En route to this goal, we must first find a way to overcome the memory limitations of molecular systems, and to discover the limits of complexity that can be achieved with individual molecules. One of the main thrusts in molecular programming is to use computer science as a tool for figuring out what can be achieved. While molecular systems that are Turing-complete have been demonstrated [Winfree, 1996], these systems still cannot achieve some of the feats biology has achieved. One might think that because a system is Turing-complete, capable of computing “anything,” that it can do any arbitrary task. But while it can simulate any digital computational problem, there are many behaviors that are not “computations” in a classical sense, and cannot be directly implemented. Examples include exponential growth and molecular motion relative to a surface. Passive self-assembly systems cannot implement these behaviors because (a) molecular motion relative to a surface requires a source of fuel that is external to the system, and (b) passive systems are too slow to assemble exponentially-fast-growing structures. We call these behaviors “energetically incomplete” programmable behaviors. This class of behaviors includes any behavior where a passive physical system simply does not have enough physical energy to perform the specified tasks in the requisite amount of time. As we will demonstrate and prove, a sufficiently expressive implementation of an “active” molecular self-assembly approach can achieve these behaviors. Using an external source of fuel solves part of the the problem, so the system is not “energetically incomplete. ” But the programmable system also needs to have sufficient expressive power to achieve the specified behaviors. Perhaps surprisingly, some of these systems do not even require Turing completeness to be sufficiently expressive. Building on a large variety of work by other scientists in the fields of DNA nanotechnology, chemistry and reconfigurable robotics, this thesis introduces several research contributions in the context of active self-assembly. We show that simple primitives such as insertion and deletion are able to generate complex and interesting results such as the growth of a linear polymer in logarithmic time and the ability of a linear polymer to treadmill. To this end we developed a formal model for active-self assembly that is directly implementable with DNA molecules. We show that this model is computationally equivalent to a machine capable of producing strings that are stronger than regular languages and, at most, as strong as context-free grammars. This is a great advance in the theory of active self- assembly as prior models were either entirely theoretical or only implementable in the context of macro-scale robotics. We developed a chain reaction method for the autonomous exponential growth of a linear DNA polymer. Our method is based on the insertion of molecules into the assembly, which generates two new insertion sites for every initial one employed. The building of a line in logarithmic time is a first step toward building a shape in logarithmic time. We demonstrate the first construction of a synthetic linear polymer that grows exponentially fast via insertion. We show that monomer molecules are converted into the polymer in logarithmic time via spectrofluorimetry and gel electrophoresis experiments. We also demonstrate the division of these polymers via the addition of a single DNA complex that competes with the insertion mechanism. This shows the growth of a population of polymers in logarithmic time. We characterize the DNA insertion mechanism that we utilize in Chapter 4. We experimentally demonstrate that we can control the kinetics of this re- action over at least seven orders of magnitude, by programming the sequences of DNA that initiate the reaction. In addition, we review co-authored work on programming <b>molecular</b> <b>robots</b> using prescriptive landscapes of DNA origami; this was the first microscopic demonstration of programming a molec- ular robot to walk on a 2 -dimensional surface. We developed a snapshot method for imaging these random walking <b>molecular</b> <b>robots</b> and a CAPTCHA-like analysis method for difficult-to-interpret imaging data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Motion {{planning}} {{deals with}} the problem of finding trajectory between two configurations in some space under some constraints. The science of motion planning deals with solving this problem efficiently in different spaces and under varying sets of constraints. This thesis provides an extended analysis of the PRM algorithm by using tools from measure theory to obtain greater generality. We then apply the results to planning in finite CW complexes and detail an application to planning with a polygonal robot in a polygonal workspace when contact is allowed. The final part of thesis deals with an application of motion planning to untangling mathematical knots. This problem is particularly interesting as it addresses motion planning with large number of degrees of freedom in a reconfigurable space.
