Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana played the role of the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles play an {{important}} role in the Halo games, and so vehicles were also given a long development stage. The UNSC's vehicles were designed by Marcus Lehto, Eric Arroyo, and Eddie Smith, and were designed to be functional and utilitarian. Their use of wheels also led many players to feel that they were <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> drive. The addition of the Mongoose ATV made headlines, after being cut from Halo 2. The original Warthog was considered a fan favorite.|$|E

[...] Jean Armour Polly and Heidi Kotansky of Common Sense Media wrote positively of the more informative activities, but noted that some lacked a sufficient amount of educational content. They write, [...] "in Oobi's Bubbles, kids drag a bubble wand next to Oobi's 'mouth' so he can blow bubbles. This just teaches tots to click and drag.

He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the [...] "zingy dialogue" [...] but found himself [...] "enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really buying into it". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin {{to carry out the}} whole episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left [...] " [...] pull it off". He thought that the two Amys seen in the mini episodes [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch and the episode did not reveal anything new about Amy and Rory. However, he praised how the decision the Doctor had to make was portrayed.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{became known}} for her [...] manipulative behavior and was often labeled a [...] "soap vixen".

That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap opera Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] John Mapes of The Biography Channel said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain.

500|$|In a very {{positive}} review, Planet Game Boy magazine praised the multiplayer mode for its selection of competitive games, concluding: [...] "Perfect Dark {{is one of the}} biggest handheld games ever made, and for fans of the [...] version it's a vital purchase." [...] IGN also praised the multiplayer mode and extras, but remarked that [...] "there's no real strategy involved in these deathmatch games other than to find the other person and open fire until one dies and respawns elsewhere on the map". In a retrospective review, Jon Wahlgren of Nintendo Life felt that Rare [...] "did a great job on squeezing so many features and technical magic into the little cart, but by focusing so heavily on the tech they seem to have sacrificed a lot of what would make it <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play".

He believed that [...] "Electronic Arts has [...] made the best even better", and he concluded, [...] "John Madden Football '93 is even <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play than Madden '92". The staff of Mean Machines Sega called the game [...] "hopelessly redundant" [...] and [...] "very, very disappoint", and they believed that the John Madden Football series was [...] "on its last legs". They considered the game to be arguably worse than its predecessors, largely because of framerate problems. The reviewers concluded that it was [...] "not a bad game at all", but they suggested that readers buy [...] "the slightly better John Madden Football '92 if [...] after the definitive American Football game".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold.

500|$|Josh Mapes of The Biography Channel listed {{her in the}} {{category}} [...] "10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate". He said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch. From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters we love to hate have each brought {{a fair share of}} great moments to primetime soaps. While Larry Hagman played the bad guy on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac. But, like most vixens on primetime soaps, she was only out for money, not love." [...] Steve Eighinger of the Quincy Newspapers listed Abby as the third-most memorable TV character in an article he wrote for the Quincy Herald-Whig. He said, [...] "No one, absolutely no one, rocked eye shadow and the messy-hair look like Abby Ewing, who was this marvelous combination of vixen and corporate sleuth. As her character developed, life on the cul-de-sac made Knots Landing destination TV every Thursday night for more than a decade." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederik Pohl {{took over}} the editorship of both If and Galaxy in 1961. Gold had had a car {{accident}} with sufficiently severe health consequences {{to prevent him from}} being able to continue as editor. Pohl, who had been intermittently helping Gold with editorial duties for some time prior to the car accident, is first listed as editor of If on the masthead of the November 1961 issue, and as editor of Galaxy for the December 1961 issue, but he had been acting as editor of both magazines since at least midyear. Pohl paid one cent per word for the stories he bought for If, whereas Galaxy paid three cents per word, and like Gold, he regarded Galaxy as the leading magazine of the two, whereas If was somewhere he could work with new writers, and try experiments and whims. This developed into a selling point when a letter from a reader, Clayton Hamlin, prompted Pohl to declare that he would publish a new writer in every single issue of the magazine, though he was also able to attract well-known writers. When Pohl began his stint as editor, both magazines were operating at a loss; despite Ifs lower budget, Pohl found it <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> edit, and commented that apparently the readers thought so, too; he was able to make If show a profit before Galaxy, adding, [...] "What was fun for me seemed to be fun for them." ...|$|E

Tom Shales of The Washington Post felt that [...] "30 Rock had [...] "consistently and considerably improved since its premiere". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as [...] "rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving". Shales said that it was [...] "painful to report" [...] that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was [...] "the show's brightest discovery", and his [...] "performance has been a bittersweet beauty". Rob Canning of IGN said that 30 Rocks was [...] "one new comedy {{we do not want to}} see taken off the air".

Despite this, he wrote that the [...] "murder case wasn't all that interesting", and called the episode predictable. Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "8 out of 10" [...] score, classifying it as [...] "great". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "A-" [...] review, he noted that it is [...] "difficult {{it is to be}} a parent" [...] on the series. Handlen wrote that [...] "Awake benefits from not poking its premise too hard", and [...] "this single-mindedness stems directly from the show's leading man". Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic mainly enjoyed this episode. McHatton claimed that [...] "It's hard not to wonder if Kate's story, and her pushing of her sister to go through with their little surfing outing that turned deadly, is some foreshadowing of how Britten's accident. He concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "4.8 out of 5". Caroline Preece from Den of Geek claimed that [...] "It's <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> block this out and theorise for yourself".

Brown was less enthusiastic, and wrote that she was tiring of the [...] "look how dumb yet kind-hearted Brittany is" [...] plots. Keller approved of the Artie and Brittany coupling, {{and said it was}} [...] "way <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch than Rachel and Finn and all their angst", and Canning felt that the episode's heart was Artie working to keep Brittany from becoming disillusioned about Santa. He also wrote, [...] "shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] Burns agreed: [...] "Coach Bieste's performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of the}} absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] However, he was disappointed by how the storyline played out: [...] "it didn't feel right that after the story the episode built around Brittany, it then felt that we needed to see Artie on his feet for it to be a truly happy ending." ...|$|E
