5|$|CSU {{issued a}} more {{detailed}} update on April7, upping their forecast to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 150. <b>More</b> <b>confidence</b> in the weakening of El Niño (and thus lower vertical wind shear) and the continuation of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean were cited. Two days later, TSR revised their forecast upward to 16.3 named storms, 8.5 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 159 units. In their April21 update, WSI predicted the most active year since the record-breaking 2005 season, with 16 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. Five days later, North Carolina State University (NCSU) released their only forecast for the season, with 15 to 18 named storms and 8 to 11 hurricanes. TSR largely maintained their forecast for their May25 release. The next day, TWC/WSI again raised their forecast to 18 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their forecast prediction for the 2010 season on May27. The organization called for an active to extremely active year including 14 to 23 named storms, 8 to 14 hurricanes, and 3 to 7 major hurricanes, referencing {{a continuation of the}} active era that began in 1995.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Campbell's millennialism {{was more}} optimistic than Stone's.

Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that {{the progress of the}} church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ. This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.|$|E
25|$|From 4 March 2010 {{until early}} 2013 Butcher {{was the head}} coach of the Zimbabwe {{national}} cricket team.

Butcher gave that side <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> and responsibility. In return, the Zimbabwean team defeated Australia and Pakistan in the warm-ups of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, but struggled in the main event.

25|$|As the {{practice}} of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the Hôtel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted that the medical treatment be scientific, not just spiritual. As medical schools became more connected to hospitals, the bodies of patients were seen as objects of medical observation used to study and teach pathological anatomy, rather than just bodies in need of hospital care.|$|E

Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> in impressions they report.

People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies.

25|$|The ninth {{round of}} the season was the European Grand Prix and Montoya held pole for most of {{qualifying}} only for both Michael and Ralf Schumacher to bump him down to third in the final seconds. At {{the start of the}} race, he kept third and ran three seconds behind the two leaders. After the first round of stops, the two leaders came ahead of the one-stopping David Coulthard but Montoya came behind. He was stuck there for five laps and it cost him three seconds. He was forced to settle for third and that became second when Ralf was given a ten-second, stop-and-go penalty for a pitlane infringement. Montoya finished in second, and the result gave him <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> than ever.|$|E
25|$|Late-season {{coaching}} adjustments {{improved the}} effectiveness of the offense and cut down on opposing teams' ability to control the ball against the defense. This resulted in their playing with <b>more</b> <b>confidence,</b> and less predictability. It also resulted in a three-game winning streak that put them in control of the division race. The regular season culminated in a season-finale matchup between the Buccaneers and the Detroit Lions, two 8–7 teams vying for the division lead in the Pontiac Silverdome, where the Lions had gone undefeated all season. The Buccaneers won and entered the playoffs as the number three seed in the NFC, where they lost to the Dallas Cowboys in a 38–0 rout which tied the NFL record for largest margin of victory in a playoff game.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} saw India make a heavy string of {{mistakes}} which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play with much <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as he popped a short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket to fall, for 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. Poor judgment from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, {{as the last}} 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, the Saints hosted Norwich City {{looking for}} a third {{consecutive}} win. The game started well for the home side, who dominated possession {{in the early stages}} and broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Rickie Lambert converted a chance from an Adam Lallana free kick. On the stroke of half time though, Robert Snodgrass equalised for the visitors to put a dampener on the spirits of the players going into the break. In the second period Norwich came out with much <b>more</b> <b>confidence,</b> and shut Southampton out of the game for a large period, with the defence weakening quickly. Southampton and Norwich were held in the deadlock though, with the sides sharing the spoils and the hosts failing {{to move out of the}} top relegation spot again.|$|E

After experiencing a brief slump during {{the latter half of}} May, Cepeda recovered, hitting 12 home runs by June 4, 1959. He was selected as a starter in both All-Star games during this season. Cepeda was briefly moved to third base to open a spot for Willie McCovey in the starting lineup, but was moved to the outfield after committing errors in the position. He hit six home runs between August and September. The Giants remained {{in the race for the}} National League's pennant during the latter part of the season, but were eliminated from competition after losing a series against the Dodgers, eventually finishing third. Cepeda led the team in batting average (.317) and RBIs (105).|$|E

He played Ronnie O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals who he had a career record 10 losses and two wins prior to the match, but Ding triumphed 13–10. Ding battled throughout in his semi-final with Mark Selby including making back-to-back centuries to end the third session at 12–12. He won two frames from 16–13 down, but missed a blue in the next frame and went on to lose 17–15. Ding said that his game would continue to improve as he had played with <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> and aggression throughout the event.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the <b>more</b> <b>confidence</b> they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
