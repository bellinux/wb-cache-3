5000|$|The attack {{method used}} with LogicLocker employs five stages. Initial infection, Horizontal and Vertical <b>movement,</b> <b>locking,</b> {{encryption}} and negotiation. Initial infection {{can take place}} through various vulnerability exploits. As ICS devices are typically in an always on state, this gives Cyber-criminals ample time to attempt the compromise of the PLC. PLCs generally do not have strong authentication mechanisms in place to assist in protecting themselves from potential attack. [...] Initial infection could take place through a users clicking of a potentially malicious email attachment. Upon initial infection of the PLC, horizontal or vertical movement can be achieved from the PLC to the corporate network depending on {{the capabilities of the}} PLC. The next stage of the attack is locking in which the attacker locks out legitimate users to inhibit or prevent restoration efforts. This can be done through password changes, OEM Locking, over-utilization of PLC resources or changing IP/Ports. These different locking methods offer varying degrees of success and strengths. To further ensure a successful attack Encryption is employed to follow traditional cryptoransomware practices for future negotiations. Lastly, negotiations are conducted between the attacker and victim for service restoration. Some PLCs contain an email capability {{that can be used to}} send the ransom message as was the case with the MicroLogix 1400 PLC used in the proof-of-concept attack.|$|E

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of Locking {{can be traced}} to one man, Don Campbell. In the late 1960s he put together several fad dances adding moves of his own (known as the [...] "Lock") when performing. The original lock was created by accident: Campbell couldn't do a move called the 'Funky Chicken' and stopped at a particular point whilst moving his arms, creating a 'locking' effect. He wasn't able to perform it fluently, for he couldn't remember which step to take next. (Even the acting towards the audience was spontaneous: when people started laughing at Don because of his unfamiliar moves, he responded by pointing at them.) These halts soon became popular as Don added them into his performances. The resulting dance was called Campbellocking, which was later shortened to Locking. In the early 1970s this set off a <b>movement</b> of <b>Locking</b> dance groups, notably Campbell's group The Lockers.

40|$|The {{reality of}} the {{so-called}} ‘resource curse’ is now widely accepted. The populations of countries that possess significant natural resources often suffer when these resources are extracted and exported.

International institutions have recently advanced what I term the ‘new natural resource policy agenda’ {{to deal with the}} problem. Its core features are (a) decentralisation of government (b) a greater role for direct citizen participation in the allocation of mining revenue; and (c) more cooperation between state agencies and commercial organisations (public-private partnerships). However, the recent history of Peru poses major questions about the effectiveness of this new policy agenda. The government has adopted both conservative fiscal policies and the new policy agenda. Over the last five years the mineral price boom has increased mining revenues markedly, but it has had little impact on poverty. More important, local level conflicts around mining operations have increased, and appear to threaten political instability even more. The problem is that, in a context of weak central state and even weaker local governments, the ‘new natural resource policy agenda’ has partially re-located the resource curse to sub-national levels. Local governments, mining companies and a variety of activist <b>movements</b> are <b>locked</b> into complex relationships that are not easy to negotiate and into conflicts that are not easily resolved.

METHODS:: Six pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaver lower legs were prepared to simulate an unstable Maisonneuve fracture.

40|$|The Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) is a dia-mond shaped {{transform}} zone {{between the}} offshore Kolbeinsey ridge and the onland North Iceland Rift Zone (Fig. 1). Its southern border is a 100 km long N 120 °E dextral strike-slip zone, a few kilo-metres offshore North {{of the island}} for 2 / 3 rds of its length. Historically, it is a seismically very active segment with dextral strike-slip and normal mecha-nisms. Pull-apparts and pressure-ridges are char-acteristic of its onland section. The eastern tip is abruptly cut off {{by one of the}} fault zones of the North Iceland Rift Zone. Following the 1975 to 1984 Krafla rifting event, the seismic activity of the Husavik fault decreased considerably. It remained negligible for more than eight years. This change can be explained by a sudden stress increase, fol-lowing the rifting episode, which would have blocked the fault. However, aseismic movement is not to be excluded. The DIAPASON software, developed at the CNES, is used to form interferograms of SAR scenes from the ERS 1 and ERS 2 satellites cover-ing the transform fault and its junction with the rift zone. We used 13 scenes, acquired between 1992 and 1998 on two parallel satellite tracks, in order to calculate 36 interferograms with temporal values of up to six years, i. e. potential displacements reaching 12 cm across the transform fault. The large number of interferograms allowed us to dis-criminate between crustal deformation and atmos-pheric or topographical artefacts, the first being always present with the same intensity regardless of temporal spacing of scenes and the latter being closely linked to the topography.

30|$|High {{velocity}} gradients can {{be explained}} by a simple elastic dislocation model. We assume a two-dimensional vertical fault with right-lateral strike slip. The fault is locked from surface to a locking depth and creeps below the locking depth to infinity. The surface velocity parallel to the fault with an elastic half-space is a symmetric pattern of arctangent with respect to the fault (Savage and Burford 1973). The calculated velocities are shown by red and blue curves with a creeping rate of 4 and 6  mm/year and a locking depth of 16  km (Fig.  2 a). The calculated velocities roughly reproduce the observed ones around a distance of 0  km. Least square fitting for the data at a distance between − 100 and 100  km suggests 6.4  ±  1.0  mm/year and 28  ±  10  km for a creeping rate and a locking depth, respectively, but the estimated creeping rate may be an upper bound due to ignoring other deformation sources including interplate coupling along the Nankai Trough. The estimated locking depth is significantly deeper than a cutoff depth of crustal seismicity (~ 10  km) (Omuralieva et al. 2012), but it must be affected by ignoring variations of the locking depth and fault geometry along the SSZ. Although it is difficult to resolve these problems from the limited sparse GNSS data, a comparison between the observed and calculated velocities suggests the right-lateral strike <b>movements</b> beneath a <b>locking</b> depth at a rate of ~ 5  mm/year along the SSZ.|$|R

On many canals and inland waterways, locks are needed to regulate the water level. These locks frequently act as bottlenecks for ships passing through these waterways. Results exist on the scheduling of a single lock in order to minimize ship waiting times. We consider here the setting where multiple locks are arranged in sequence, and analyse the performance gain that can be achieved by scheduling the entire system of locks, as opposed to each lock individually. In an attempt to minimize the total waiting time incurred by ships, we define a class of synchronized schedules in which the <b>lock</b> <b>movements</b> of the different locks satisfy certain properties. We introduce a dynamic programming procedure to find a schedule contained within this class of synchronized solutions which has minimal waiting time. We consider a number of different variants of this problem, and investigate when this approach leads to a globally optimal solution. In contrast to the centralized decision, we also compute a decentralized solution where the locks behave more independent of each other, based on the procedure for scheduling a single lock. We then compare the quality of these decentralized solutions to the centralized solutions, in order to assess the achievable performance improvement. status: publishe...|$|R
