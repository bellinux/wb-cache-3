6000|$|... "The {{trail to}} the ranch was rougher than I expected," [...] put in Andy. [...] "If you tried to run a horse over it he would most likely break a leg and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> break your neck." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Numskull!" [...] she exclaimed, {{but still}} in that good humoured voice of banter {{that he never}} had withstood, [...] "you know what I mean, though <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have me say it in the street, you that have secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why you see {{we are in}} a bit of trouble, and {{the boys}} thought <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give us a lift, if we'd tackle you--that is, if I've got the rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} 'worth while'? If {{you get to be}} Gruensberg's secretary--and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> if you kept up your {{shorthand}} and didn't go sneaking off to concerts and talkfests every evening--I guess you'll find thirty-five or forty bones a week worth while!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{is proper}} that is right, Mabel; and {{everything}} is right that leads to justice and fair dealing; though it is painful enough, as you say, as I find on trial, I do. Now, Mabel, had you known that Eau-douce thinks of you in this way, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> never <b>would</b> have consented {{to be married to}} one as old and as uncomely as I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't very nice, either," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "Well, our {{goods are}} on the way, and by Thursday we'll be {{independent}} of any one. But <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> are right--it <b>would</b> excite comment if I left the mess. I will join you all at meals until {{we are ready to}} light our own kitchen fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some for {{the book}} of verse, some for the simple life, and some for the shark's belly," [...] he laughed grimly, then added: [...] "Just the same, I wish I could swim as well as <b>you.</b> <b>Maybe</b> it <b>would</b> beget {{confidence}} such as you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were a rascal of that breed," [...] said the man. [...] "I've had the {{handling}} of one or two of you gentry before, and I never found one that could stand up to me for five minutes. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to try?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{but there}} is always the hope of escape or of exchange. When you spoke kindly to me this {{afternoon}} I partly understood what you said, for in this long time I have been on board I have come to understand a little Spanish, and I thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> assist me in some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure yer honour {{knows better}} than me. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be liking to let the young lady know how we're getting on now, {{and to find out}} whether her father has come home, and how things are going. Yer honour will excuse me, but it just seemed natural that you should be wishing to send a line; and a sweeter young lady never trod the sod." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her? As black's your hat! But I dinna {{suppose she}} <b>would</b> <b>maybe</b> be what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ca' ill-looked a'thegither. Na, she's {{a kind of}} a {{handsome}} jaud--a kind o' gipsy," [...] said the aunt, who had two sets of scales for men and women--or perhaps it would be more fair to say that she had three, and the third and the most loaded was for girls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{can tell}} what I think? Perhaps {{something}} {{like what you}} say has gone through my mind. Why, Nancy, if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> listen once, I could convince you of it, too. Come, now, {{look at it in}} this light! If God lets a man say and do what the man pleases--and He has to do it every now and then according to what the Book tells--why ain't the man equal with God? <b>You</b> believe, <b>maybe,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be struck dead if you said the things that I do; but why ain't I struck dead? Why, either because it ain't so, at all, or because I'm God. It stands to reason, don't it? What is God, anyway? If He was so mighty and terrible, wouldn't He have ways of showing it in these times just as much as in those old times that we read about in the Book? ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{we could}} get Mary Boyle, we would do [...] "Used Up," [...] which is a {{delightful}} piece, as the farce. But <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> know nothing about the said Mary, {{and in that case}} I should like to know what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think of doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] {{said the}} ex-corporal, {{speaking}} in a whining voice, and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing, [...] "I'm an old gunner in the Queen's service, sir, and knowing your name by hearing it in India I thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> take me as your groom or gardener, or give me any other place as happened to be vacant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have ridden hither," [...] one said, with {{a strong}} nasal twang, [...] "Zachariah Stebbings, having letters of {{introduction}} {{to you from the}} governor. These will tell that I am minded to purchase an estate in the island. The governor tells me that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be disposed to sell, and that if not, I might see the methods of work and culture here, and learn from you the name of one disposed to part with his property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are old fellows now, Mr. Croftangry," [...] said my landlord; [...] "scarcely so fit {{to take a}} poor {{quart of}} claret between us, as {{we would have been}} in better days to take a pint, in the old Scottish liberal {{acceptation}} of the phrase. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have liked me to have kept James to help us. But if it is not a holyday or so, I think it is best he should observe office hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, Messire," [...] quoth King Arthur, [...] "methought when I beheld this lady, that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not be {{very far}} distant from her." [...] Then he said unto the Lady of the Lake: [...] "Lady, I prithee tell me, who is this fair youth who is with you.

6000|$|... "Friend John, {{forgive me}} if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my heart then when I want to laugh, {{if you could have}} done so when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> perhaps pity me the most of all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had chosen}} {{this part of}} the country, and, after a time, I became uneasy in my mind, as to whether I was doing right; and whether, for the child's sake, I ought not to tell you that she was alive, and offer to give her up, if you were willing to take her. I heard how your son's death had changed you, and thought that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to take his daughter; but, before {{bringing}} her to you, I thought she should have a better education than I had time to give her, and that she should be placed with a lady, so that, if you took her, you need not be ashamed of her manners.|$|E
6000|$|... "You talked {{together}} {{for two hours}} in a corner," [...] said the Woman of the World. [...] "I asked him when you had gone {{what he thought of}} you. 'Ah! what a talker!' he exclaimed, making a gesture of admiration with his hands. 'I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> notice it,' I answered him. 'Tell me, what did he talk about?' I was curious to know; you had been so absorbed in yourselves and so oblivious to the rest of us. 'Upon my word,' he replied, 'I really cannot tell you. Do you know, I am afraid, now I come to think of it, that I must have monopolised the conversation.' I was glad to be able to ease his mind on that point. 'I really don't think you did,' I assured him. I should have felt equally confident had I not been present." ...|$|E

5000|$|Carol is {{sensitive}} towards {{the lack of}} recognition the ER nurses experience.

5000|$|In another interview, Hart said, [...] "When I was 21 or 22, I was in {{love with}} {{somebody}} who my mom did not feel was a good fit. So my family disowned me for about three years. And the last conversation I had with my mother when I was home I’d said, 'if you could only see the way she loves me, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> understand.' I just wrote that song, after that phone call, literally in a matter of minutes." ...|$|E

40|$|All of {{the senses}} are {{important}} when eating. Think about eating a potato chip – fi rst you see the chip (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> notice if it has any dark/burnt spots?). Next <b>you</b> touch it (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> notice if it’s greasy, or if it’s thick?). Then as you bring the chip to your mouth <b>you</b> smell it (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> smell the seasoning? Or the oil it was fried or baked in?), then you eat it and hear the crunch of the chip, and you probably also taste the saltiness (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> also experience some additional fl avor?).
