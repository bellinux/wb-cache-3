40|$|Rice used as adjunct {{is limited}} because the {{relative}} lower soluble nitrogen compare {{with that of}} barely will dilute total nitrogenous substances in wort and beer. Therefore, modification of mashing method and Neutrase®; addition were proposed to increase rice/barley malt ratio. Total protein contents of four rice cultivars determined by Kjeldahl method were in a range of 6. 53 - 7. 49 % (w/w). Amount of Neutrase® and <b>mashing</b> <b>time</b> for increasing protein were determined by mashing at 52 °C and found that increasing of <b>mashing</b> <b>time</b> increased soluble nitrogen and Free Alpha Amino Nitrogen (FAN) in wort more than 30 % and 70 %, respectively. The proper <b>mashing</b> <b>time</b> was 60 min and the appropriate amount of Neutrase®; was 400 μl per 50 g rice. In addition, activation of Termamyl SC®; at 950 C for 20 min also influenced more solubilized protein in rice cooking step. Afterward, the appropriate mashing program was evaluated in various rice/barley malt ratios. The qualified wort contained at least 150 mg/L FAN were obtained from wort used rice up to 80 % and had satisfied fermentation performance. Therefore, Neutrase®; addition plus modification mashing method could be one solution for increasing rice/barley malt ratio...|$|E

40|$|The Brewing Industry {{is facing}} {{increasingly}} challenging times {{due to global}} competitive business environment and rising costs of raw materials. These factors consequently affect {{the economy of the}} industry. An effective solution to stay competitive is to enhance brewing process efficiency by optimisation of process units. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate optimal operating conditions that can be implemented in the brewing industry using the Micro- Brewery Plant at the University of the Witwatersrand. It was discovered that the longer the mashing route, the higher the yield of fermentable sugars. The mash regime and liquor to malt ratios were optimised and the carbohydrates obtained were analysed at 3. 5 L of water per kg of malt and a total <b>mash</b> <b>time</b> of 105 min. Carbohydrate and phenolic acid analyses were performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a UV-vis detector. The three different malts used had a phenolic acid content of 33. 25 μg/mL, 25. 44 μg/mL and 19. 98 μg/mL for malt A, B and C, respectively. The plot of 1 /T versus Ln(t) gave a negative slope with activation energy (Ea) = 209 KJ/mol, rate constant (k) = 4. 6 x 10 - 4 mg/L min, which are comparable to similar data reported in the literature. The kinetics studies showed that the optimised mashing temperature of 900 C was adequate to form 4 -Vinylguaiacol by thermal decarboxylation from the hydroxycinnamic acids. This study has shown that there is no direct correlation between phenolic acids and oxidative flavour stability of beer while the corresponding volatile phenols may affect beer flavour. The study showed that fermentation rates increase with temperature. Investigated pitching rates showed iv insignificant effect on fermentation rates. The study showed that added finings during boiling improve beer clarity and have an insignificant effect on fermentation rates. Analysis of commissioning strategies at Wits micro-brewery plant showed that verbal instruction is always open to error, while the written instruction or report is generally not open to error. Hence the commissioning documents have been developed in the study, which has helped in reduction of errors during brewing. It is therefore concluded that good record keeping and documentation is of essential need for successful commissioning of a brewery...|$|R

The mashes obtained using the pressure-thermal method and malt enzymes revealed a similar pattern.

Effect of {{pelleting}} on {{survival of}} porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-contaminated feed. Journal of Animal Science, 95 (3), 1170 - 1178. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016. 0961 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a heat-sensitive virus that has devastated the U. S. swine industry. Because of its heat sensitivity, {{we hypothesized that}} a steam conditioner and pellet mill mimicking traditional commercial thermal processing may mitigate PEDV infectivity. Pelleting, a common feed processing method, includes the use of steam and shear forces, resulting in increased temperature of the processed feed. Two thermal processing experiments were designed to determine if different pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures would impact PEDV quantity and infectivity by analysis of quantitative reverse transcription PCR and bioassay. In Exp. 1, a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial design was used with 3 pelleting temperatures (68. 3, 79. 4, and 90. 6 degrees C), 3 conditioning times (45, 90, or 180 s), and 2 doses of viral inoculation (low, 1 x 102 tissue culture infectious dose(50) (the concentration used to see cytopathic effect in 50 % of the cells) /g, or high, 1 x 10 (4) tissue culture infectious dose(50) /g). Noninoculated and PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash were used as controls. The low-dose PEDV-infected mash had 6. 8 +/- 1. 8 cycle threshold (Ct) greater (P < 0. 05) PEDV than the high-dose <b>mash.</b> Regardless of <b>time</b> or temperature, pelleting reduced (P < 0. 05) the quantity of detectable viral PEDV RNA compared with the PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash. Fecal swabs from pigs inoculated with the PEDV-positive unprocessed mash, regardless of dose, were clinically PEDV positive from 2 to 7 d (end of the trial) after inoculation. However, if either PEDV dose of inoculated feed was pelleted {{at any of the}} 9 tested conditioning time x temperature combinations, no PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs or cecum content. Based on Exp. 1 results, a second experiment was developed to determine the impact of lower processing temperatures on PEDV quantity and infectivity. In Exp. 2, PEDV-inoculated feed was pelleted at 1 of 5 conditioning temperatures (37. 8, 46. 1, 54. 4, 62. 8, and 71. 1 degrees C) for 30 s. The 5 increasing processing temperatures led to feed with respective mean Ct values of 32. 5, 34. 6, 37. 0, 36. 5, and 36. 7, respectively. All samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, infectivity was detected by bioassay only in pigs from the 37. 8 and 46. 1 degrees C conditioning temperatures. Experiment 2 results suggest conditioning and pelleting temperatures above 54. 4 degrees C could be effective in reducing the quantity and infectivity of PEDV in swine feed. However, additional research is needed to prevent subsequent recontamination after pelleting as it is a point-in-time mitigation step...|$|R
