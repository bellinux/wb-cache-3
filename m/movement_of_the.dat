5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Charismatics {{trace their}} {{historical}} origins to the charismatic <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|Due to the erratic <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm {{along the}} Texas coastline, {{significant}} rainfall fell in areas {{near the center}} and in parts of Louisiana.

This cell was never given the {{classification}} of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor. Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable than the first, following the general <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E
