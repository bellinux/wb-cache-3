Transmission electron microscopy (1 EM), utilizing the microcube encapsulation technique and protocols for immunolocalization of milk proteins, provides {{insight into the}} phenomenon of age gelation ofUHT-sterilized, ultrafiltered (UF) <b>milk</b> <b>retentate.</b> Primary antibodies (specific for the native {{as well as the}} complexed forms of milk proteins) and secondary antibodies (conjugated to gold probes) are used to elucidate the positions of the milk proteins in various samples of milk from the stage of milking through UHT sterilization and storage for 12 months, by which time gelation had occurred. The movement of the milk proteins is charted and these data are used to determine the role of the proteins in age gelation of UHT-sterilized UF <b>milk</b> <b>retentate.</b> Heat-denatured β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin form complexes within the serum {{as well as with the}} casein components of the micelles. UHT sterilization not only denatures β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin, but catalyzes the reaction of these whey proteins and K-casein, leading to the successful formation of the complex. Complexing of β-lactoglobulin and K-casein competitively weakens the complex of K-casein to other casein fractions of the micelle. This leads to migration of K-casein from the micelle to the serum, compromising the role of K-casein in stabilizing the casein proteins within the micellar moiety. The time-dependent loss of K-casein from the micelle would expose the calcium-insoluble micellar αs 1 -casein and β-casein to the serum calcium. Subsequent to this, some αs 1 -casein and β-casein are also released from the micelles, and gelation of the milk occurs. No information was obtained on location of αs 2 -casein. The release of K-casein from the micelles thus apparently represents the critical factor in the phenomenon of age gelation in UHT-sterilized milk concentrates...|$|E

Pasteurized skim milk was concentrated to 3 X by ultrafiltration. In the pH study portions of skim <b>milk</b> <b>retentate</b> were adjusted to pH 6. 38 ±. 02 with HCl and 6. 85 ±. 01 and 7. 32 ±. 02 with NaOH between ultrafiltration and ultra-high temperature processing. In the storage temperature study, storage temperatures used for pH-unadjusted retentate samples were 11 °C, 23 °C (room temperature), and 37 °C. Although pH 6. 38 samples had the lowest viscosity in the pH study before ultra-high temperature processing, these samples precipitated during ultra-high temperature processing. For non-acidified samples, increasing pH of retentate resulted in higher viscosities and quicker age gelation times. Destabilization occurred more rapidly at 37 °C than at 23 °C or 11 °C. The pH drop tended to be greater for samples stored at a higher temperature or adjusted to a higher pH. During 28 weeks of 37 °C storage the pH decreased from 6. 54 to 6. 06. During 32 weeks of 23 °C storage pH of samples initially adjusted to pH 7. 32 dropped to 7. 06. ζ-Potentials of casein micelles were calculated from electrophoretic mobility obtained by measuring Doppler frequency shifts of scattered laser light in samples that had been diluted 300 fold with their own ultra. filtrate. Absolute values of ζ-potential of samples stored at 37 °C decreased from - 23. 4 millivolts immediately after ultra-high temperature processing to - 18. 5 millivolts after 28 weeks of storage.

40|$|Three serious {{problems}} have been experienced {{in the manufacture of}} low moisture cheese using ultrafiltration (UF) - high fat-loss, excessive moisture retention, and poor cheese texture. In this work the causes of these problems were identified, and means of overcoming them were developed. Coagulation and cheese-making experiments indicated that UF concentration of milk shifts the control of rennet coagulation toward the casein micelle collision rate and away from rennet activity, resulting in formation of a rough-textured curd structure that resists syneresis. Use of 4 x whole <b>milk</b> <b>retentate,</b> instead of 5 x, improved rennet curd structure, syneresis, and UF cheese texture without reducing protein retention in the cheese. Use of increased rennet and reduced set temperature (26 °C) also improved curd structure, syneresis, and cheese texture. Washing of the rennet curd prepared from 4 x <b>milk</b> <b>retentate</b> during cheese-making, instead of diafiltration of retentate, was found to improve cheese texture, and cheese moisture below 39 % was achieved. UF retentate was inconsistent as a starter medium because it offered no protection against bacteriophage proliferation, and the growth of some strains of Lactococcus lactis was impaired in UF retentate. Commercial, internally-buffered pH-controlled starter media were more consistent than fermented retentate starter when used for making cheese from 4 x retentate. Low-pressure homogenization of milk at a temperature between 37 °C and 45 °C increased fat recovery in UF cheese made from 4 x ultrafiltration concentrated milk with minimal damage to cheese texture and syneresis. A procedure was developed for the manufacture of quality, high-yield, low-moisture cheese from 4 times ultrafiltration concentrated whole milk.

40|$|The {{homogenisation}} of {{milk and}} cream has been widely studied but the effect of sonication on the structural and functional properties of cream is not well known. In this study, raw <b>milk,</b> ultrafiltration <b>retentate</b> and cream samples were sonicated at 20 kHz and the rennet and acid gelation properties of these sonicated samples investigated. High pressure homogenisation at 80 bar was also performed for comparison. Sonication of raw <b>milk</b> and <b>retentate</b> samples led to {{a decrease in the}} fat globule size. Conversely, the fat globules in cream samples sonicated at < 10 °C flocculated to form grapelike structures whereas the cream samples sonicated at 50 °C did not form such aggregates. High pressure homogenisation at 50 °C led to similar flocculated structures, but these were not observed at low temperatures. This suggests a potential benefit of sonication technology in allowing low temperatures to be utilised for cream homogenisation, reducing energy demand. However, a gel made using cheese-milk with sonicated cream resulted in separation of a fat layer rather than the incorporation of the fat globules into the gel matrix. Rennet gelation properties of both the sonicated or homogenised samples were significantly superior to a native control sample where the resultant gels had shorter coagulation times and decreased syneresis...|$|R

Increasing the pasteurization temperature of skim milk from 61. 8 to 79. 4 C for 30 minutes resulted in 15. 6 % increase in cultured cottage cheese yields. However, the high heat cheese exhibited variable quality and was generally inferior to the control. Cheese making from high heat skim milk was done by cutting at the A.

Skim milk was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 12, 16, and 20 % solids. The 20 % retentate was produced by concentrating skim milk 5 : 1 and then subjecting it to diafiltration with an equivalent volume of deionized water. The acidification of the retentates was accomplished by metering concentrated hydrochloric acid into the vortex of the centrifugal Culture growth in 20 % retentates was inhibited below and soluble phosphate seemed to be an important factor in this inhibition. The yield trials indicated that the increase in yields over cultured cottage cheese made from skim milk was 12. 4, 15. 3, 5. 6 and 1. 6 % for 16 % cultured, 16 % direct acid, 20 % cultured and 20 % direct acid cottage cheeses made from retentates. The lower yield increases from 20 % retentates was because of the shattering of the curd while cooking, and the diffusion of the whey proteins. While the quality of cultured cottage produced by ultrafiltration was as good as the cultured cottage cheese from skim milk, the direct acid cottage cheeses were much inferior. Considering both high heat treatment of skim milk and ultrafiltration for increasing cottage cheese yields, ultrafiltration seems to be the better method owing to the much better quality of cheese produced. To obtain maximum benefits from ultrafiltration, problems of lactic culture growth in retentates must be solved and non conventional cooking methods have to be developed for handling curds from high solids retentates...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Effects of Filtration Temperature and Heat Treatment on Composition and Rheological Properties of Whole <b>Milk</b> Ultra{{filtration}} <b>Retentates</b> John William Montella For {{the first}} part of my thesis, the effects of filtration temperature and heat treatment on the compositional properties of whole <b>milk</b> Ultrafiltration <b>retentate</b> (UF) were studied. Ultrafiltration is primarily run at temperatures in the range of 50 - 55 °C but more and more plants are starting to filter at refrigeration temperatures. In the ultrafiltration of milk, filtration temperature can affect the composition of the retentate by affecting the chemistry of milk components. The application of a pasteurization step can also affect the chemistry of milk components. There were two filtration temperatures used: 10 °C and 50 °C. The effect of stage in the filtration process in which the pasteurization step is applied (before UF vs. after UF) is also studied. The heat treatment used was a batch pasteurization treatment of 63 °C for 30 minutes. The milk was concentrated to a Volume Concentration Ratio (VCR) of 3 X through a 10, 000 Molecular Weight Cut Off polysulfone membrane. Compositional analysis was performed on permeate and retentate. According to my results, there were significant treatment effects on the retention of true protein (both casein and whey protein nitrogen), total protein, non-casein nitrogen, minerals (including Ca) and pH of the retentate. The chemistry of the milk components were considered as possible reasons for these differences. The week of processing did not affect the results. For the second part, the effect of composition of the retentate on their viscosity and flow properties was observed. Rheological properties are very important in process design and for consumer acceptability. Flow and viscosity data was collected using a dynamic stress rheometer. Three analytical temperatures were used during the rheological measurements: 10 °C, 40 °C, and 70 °C. A shear rate of 500 s- 1 was used for viscosity analysis. Flow properties were also observed using the same three temperatures. According to the results, all the retentate displayed shear thinning behavior and this behavior became more pronounced as the testing temperature increased. As the shear rate increased, there was a shear thickening effect that became more pronounced as temperature increased. There was a significant effect of treatment on the viscosities of the retentate. Compositional differences in the retentate are possible contributors to observed results. The week of processing had no effect on the results. For the final part, the effect of filtration temperature and heat treatment on rennet coagulation time of retentate was observed. A 22 μl aliquot of chymosin was added to 100 ml of retentate heated to 30 °C prior to analysis. Rennet coagulation time was monitored using a dynamic stress rheometer. The rennet coagulation time was recorded as the time at which the G’ value reached 1 Pa. There was a significant effect of filtration temperature and heat treatment on the rennet coagulation time of the retentate. Compositional differences are all possible contributors to these differences. From the observations from all three studies, the following conclusions can be made: (1) There were significant differences observed with respect to filtration temperature and heat treatments on chemical composition of the retentate; (2) The retentate displayed a shear thinning behavior and the chemical composition of the retentate could be a contributing factor as well as the sample testing temperature. There was also a significant treatment effect on the viscosity of the retentate; and (3) Significant differences in rennet coagulation times were observed, possibly due to compositional differences of retentate.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria, as well as some fungal species, can exhibit antifungal activities with large differences in activity between strains. Therefore, it is necessary to develop high-throughput screening methods to test a large number of strains and find the most efficient ones. In the present study, we developed a miniaturized high-throughput screening technique to rapidly detect antifungal activities in a cheese-like model. This model, distributed in a 24 -well plate, consisted of 5 -fold concentrated whole <b>milk</b> ultrafiltration <b>retentate</b> (final fat concentration of 45 %), rennet (0. 03 %) and inoculated with a mesophilic lactic commercial starter and a pH indicator.

After cultivation, cultures (100 µl) were deposited on the miniature cheese surfaces followed by inoculation in duplicate with 50 spores or cells of 4 different fungal targets (1 fungi/plate), e. g., Mucor racemosus, Galactomyces geotrichum, Penicillium commune and Yarrowia lipolytica, and incubation at 12 °C for up to 15 days. We screened 505 bacterial isolates belonging to Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Propiobacterium genera and 198 fungal isolates belonging to 28 genera. This high-throughput screening for antifungal activity revealed that 52 and 216 bacteria, and, 53 and 89 fungi, inhibited at least one fungal target after cultivation in UF and LH, respectively. Among the 4 tested fungal targets, P. commune was the most frequently inhibited fungus while only few isolates were able to inhibit M. racemosus or Y. lipolytica.

Retentate was inoculated with lactic starter culture and incubated (prefermented) until all lactose was converted to lactic acid. The final pH stabilized at about 5. 0 - 5. 2; the desired pH of the cheese curd. Incubation at 25 °C allowed the retentate to remain liquid during prefermentation and easily pumped through pipes. After prefermentation, retentate was passed through a mechanical curd former where rennet was injected and mixed. The retentate-rennet mixture coagulated as it traveled upward through a cylinder. The curd emerged from the curd former and was cut into cubes by a grid of knives. The curd cubes were treated for removal of moisture by cooking in liquid and evaporation under vacuum. After moisture removal, curd was drained. salted and pressed. Cheddaring and milling were unnecessary. Experiments were performed to determine proper methods for preparing retentate. Diafiltration level was significantly related to lactose concentration in retentate (p=. OOO 1) and final pH of fermented retentate (p=. OOO 1). Acidified permeate and acidified, deionized water were evaluated as cooking liquids. Cheese made from curd cooked in permeate had acid defects. but curd cooked in water produced cheese with a pH similar to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese. Moisture content of all finished cheese was excessive for Cheddar cheese. Body and texture of cheese made from curd cooked in water was close to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese.

40|$|Caseins are {{regarded}} as one of the principal functional food proteins which provide foaming, emulsifying, and water binding properties in food systems. Most of commercial caseins are produced by destabilizing casein micelles by rennet coagulation or acid precipitation, hence the native casein micelles are disrupted. With the advancement of microfiltration technology, it is possible to separate casein by microfiltration (MF) of skim milk while maintaining its micellar structure. The MF retentate of skim milk is called micellar casein concentrate (MCC). Fresh liquid MCC can be further concentrated by ultrafiltration (UF) to remove excess water, and at the same time remove low molecular weight (MW) compounds which can pass through the UF membrane. The liquid MCC can also be spray dried to produce powder. The MCC is a milk protein ingredient with properties that are different from other available protein ingredients, thus it might serve particular functions that other protein ingredients can't deliver. MCC could be used for high-protein, low-lactose drinks, cheesemaking, including production of low-fat Cheddar cheese. Our 1 st objective was to develop a process to produce a high concentration liquid MCC (18 % protein) with a long refrigerated shelf-life. To achieve a long refrigerated shelf-life, the processing of MCC 18 was designed to maximize the removal of low MW compounds, e. g. lactose, nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) which can be easily metabolized by microbes, while minimizing the microbial count in the final product. The production of MCC 18 was replicated 3 times. Skim milk was ultrafiltered (UF) which removed more than a half of lactose and NPN. The UF skim <b>milk</b> <b>retentate</b> was microfiltered (MF) in 3 stages to remove approximately 95 % of the serum protein and further remove lactose and NPN. The final MF retentate was concentrated to 18 % protein by UF, then batch pasteurized. The MCC 18 was collected immediately in sterile plastic vials and stored at 4 °C. The MCC 18 contained 21. 75 % total solids, 18. 27 % true protein, 0. 31 % nonprotein nitrogen and 0. 13 % lactose. The mean aerobic bacterial and spore counts of MCC 18 at day 0 were 2. 1 log cfu/mL and 2. 3 log cfu/mL, respectively. The MCC 18 produced in this study maintained a bacterial count < 20, 000 cfu/mL for 16 wk when stored at refrigeration temperature of 4 °C. The conversion of skim milk to MCC and its coproducts (serum protein concentrate and lactose concentrate) could be used as an alternative to balance milk production seasonality. Our 2 nd objective was to produce low-fat Cheddar cheese (LFCC) by combining reducedfat Cheddar cheese (RFCC) made by a fat removal process with MCC to try to achieve texture and flavor characteristics of full-fat Cheddar cheese (FFCC). The production of LFCC was replicated 3 times with a different batch of commercial FFCC, from which RFCC was produced, as an ingredient for LFCC-making. The LFCC was formulated to achieve 6 % fat, 28 % protein, 1. 2 % salt by combination of RFCC, MCC powder, water, salt, lactic acid and rennet. The 6 % fat target was used to comply with the FDA standard for a low-fat label claim. The pH of the LFCC mixture was adjusted to 5. 3 by lactic acid. Rennet was added, followed by pressing and packaging. Chemical and sensory data were analyzed by ANOVA using the Proc GLM of SAS to determine if there were differences on chemical compositions and sensory among different cheeses. Descriptive sensory scores were used to construct a PCA biplot to visualize flavor profile differences among cheeses. The LFCC had 83 % less fat, 32 % less sodium, higher protein and moisture than FFCC. When the cheese texture was evaluated in the context of a filled-gel model consisting matrix and filler (100 % minus % matrix), the LFCC had lower filler volume than FFCC, yet the LFCC had a softer texture than FFCC. The LFCC contained some of the original FFCC cheese matrix that had been disrupted by the fat removal process, and this original FFCC matrix was embedded in a LFCC matrix formed by the action of rennet on casein from the continuous phase of hydrated MCC. Thus, the texture of the LFCC was desirable and was softer than the FFCC it was made from, whereas commercial RFCC (50 % and 75 % fat reduction) were firmer than the FFCC. The sulfur flavor in LFCC was closer to FFCC, than commercial RFCC. The LFCC had bitter and grape-tortilla off-flavors which came from the dried MCC ingredient. The commercial RFCC and experimental LFCC made in this study were missing the typical aged Cheddar character (catty, nutty, fruity, brothy, milkfat) found in FFCC...|$|E

It has soft or semi-hard texture and a salty, acid taste. There are similar types of Turkish white cheese around the world such as Bulgaria’s Sirene, Romania’s Telamme, Greece’s Feta,Yugoslavia’s  Primonski Sir and Grobniciki  Sir,  Israel’s Brinsa, America’s Queso Blanco and  Pickle  Cheese  and  Egypt’s Domiati  cheese.   Membrane filtration techniques are used in the milk industry for several purposes such as fractionation of milk fat from whole milk, removal of bacteria and spores from milk, standardization or enrichment of protein content of the milk etc. Membrane filtration techniques are readily used in cheese production, since cheese production is actually a kind of concentration (enrichment) process. Ultrafiltration and microfiltration are the major membrane processes employed in the cheese industry. These filtration processes are used to produce cheese from <b>milk</b> <b>retentates.</b> Ultrafiltration has been applied to cheese production over the past 45 years, whereas microfiltration is a more recent technology. Although ultrafiltration offers some benefits in cheese manufacturing such as improvement in hygienic capacity, minimal heating, increased cheese yield, homogeneity {{of the quality of the}} final cheese product, it is observed to have negative impacts on cheese quality due to the enrichment of whey proteins in the ultrafiltrated milk. However, in microfiltration larger membrane pore sizes are used. For this reason, the enrichment of whey proteins in cheese milk is less. Milk is a complex mixture of different components such as fat, protein, lactose, minerals, etc. These components have unique nutritional and functional characteristics. Whey proteins represent approximately 20 % of the milk proteins. In traditional cheese production whey proteins remain in the whey with fat, caseinomacropeptides, rennet, etc. For this reason, purification or concentration of whey proteins is difficult and expensive. Also, whey has low solid content and high biological oxygen demand (BOD), which creates a major disposal problem. On the other hand, the permeate stream obtained after microfiltration of milk is referred to as “ideal whey” since it contains whey proteins that do not contribute to the cheesemaking process. Thus, unlike classical whey, ideal whey has sterile native components with higly functional properties and also no fat in its composition. The presence of fat in whey leads to decreased functional properties and shorter storage life. Moreover, microfiltered whey proteins maintain their biological activity and have a better flavor profile than classical whey. Therefore, ideal whey is a much better raw material for manufacturing high quality whey protein ingredients. The aim of the present study is to investigate the chemical composition and the quality parameters of white brined cheese obtained from pasteurized milk enriched upon microfiltration. For this purpose, two types of microfiltration membranes were used: a polyethersulfone membrane (MP 005) with a pore size of 0. 05 μm, and a polyvilidene fluoride membrane (MV 020) with a pore size of 0. 20 μm. Microfiltration equipment used is a laboratory scale SEPA CF-II membrane test unit equipped with a flat plate. Enrichment factors of 1. 59, 1. 71, 1. 85, and 1. 93 were achieved with the polyethersulfone membrane, whereas the enrichment factor was 1. 24 with the polyvilidene fluoride membrane. Chemical compositions of the permeate and the retentate streams were analyzed with respect to dry matter, protein, fat and ash contents.   White cheese was obtained from the retentate streams enriched upon microfiltration. White cheese obtained directly from pasteurized milk was used as the control sample. Chemical compositions of the white brined cheese samples were analyzed with regard to dry matter, protein, fat, ash, salt contents and acidity. Whey obtained upon cheese making was analyzed with respect to dry matter, protein and ash contents. Color (L*, a*, b*) and texture parameters (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) of cheese samples including the control were measured and evaluated.

Percent retention (for any component Y) was determined as: [l - (%Y in soln. permeate/%Y in soln. retentate) ] X 100 where %Y in soln. = [%Y/(%Y + %H 20) ] Simultaneous samples of retentate and permeate were taken at several points during each process. Percent retention of total solids, fat, total protein, rennet clottable nitrogen, lactose, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin was determined at each sampling point. Percent retention of β-carotene, vitamin B 12, retinol, and zinc was determined {{at different stages of}} ultrafiltration only. As UF proceeded, percent retention of total solids, total protein, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin increased. Percent retention of lactose was not affected and was 0 - 4 %. Percent retention of fat, rennet clottable nitrogen, zinc, retinal, β-carotene, and vitamin B 12 was 99 - 100 %. As diafiltration proceeded, percent retention of total solids, lactose, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin increased. Percent retention of these nutrients was increased when compared to ultrafiltration alone. Milks with lower pH values (resulting from preacidification) also had lower percent retention of total calcium and phosphorous than milks with normal pH values. Percent retention of sodium was lower during ultrafiltration and diafiltration of acidified milk when compared to ultrafiltration and diafiltration of normal milk. Percent retention of other nutrients was not affected by acidification. Loss of whey proteins into permeate resulted in a lower recovery of total protein after diafiltration than ultrafiltration alone and ultrafiltration of acidified milk. These proteins were determined to be α-lactogobulin and β-lactogobulin...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryWhey is {{becoming}} an important product for the dairy industry. In the last 15 years, the characterization of whey proteins (β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), α-lactalbumin (α-La), Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Immunoglobulin (Ig), Lactoferin (LF), Glycomacropeptide (GMP) and Casein macropeptide (CMP)) has become an important issue for biochemists and dairy companies. Characterization of the protein in whey is necessary to obtain possible methods to achieve the best whey based products. This project is a comparison of three different methods for protein characterization in order to observe and compare the main proteins in whey and skimmed milk. Whey samples were generated through the microfiltration of skimmed milk where permeate is defined as native whey. During this whey sample preparation, a second type of whey was formed. This whey is the retentate generated from the ultrafiltration of permeate (native whey) and is called native whey protein concentrate from microfiltrated milk. FT-IR spectroscopy, Gel electrophoresis and Mass spectrometry based proteomics were the methods {{that were used in}} this project to characterize the milk samples concentrate. Initially sample preparation methods were developed to obtain protein samples for analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to evaluate differences between each sample according to the type of filtration or the concentration factor of each process. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to FT-IR spectra in regions of 3043 - 898 cm− 1 in order to identify the differences between skimmed <b>milk,</b> permeate and <b>retentate</b> proteins. Use of this method allowed analysis of the most important wavenumbers for each group of samples. PLS modelling was used to compare the data from FT-IR against other methods, by showing the correlation between samples. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to predict the presence of certain proteins in the samples based on their molecular weight. Gel scans show the distinct protein sizes in the whey and skimmed milk. The method does not allow identifying proteins but it may answer some biochemical questions. Mass spectrometry based proteomics (using LC-MS/MS) is commonly used to identify proteins in biological samples. Protein characterization by this method is based on detection of peptides following trypsination of the samples, a so called bottom-up approach. Tandem mass spectra are collected from peptides and in order to identify the proteins, the results are searched against a database of proteins derived from genomic sequences. Β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and casein were the major proteins present in my samples. The existence of BSA, lactoferin, immunoglobulin and glycomacropeptide as the minor proteins were also detected. Most of the SDS-PAGE observations were in agreement with LC-MS/MS results. The results indicate that mass spectrometry provided the most information concerning the protein content of the samples. Although depending on the research needs SDS-PAGE or FT-IR analysis may be sufficient...|$|R

A microfiltração tem sido utilizada para remoção de micro-organismos e aumento da qualidade e vida de prateleira de leite fluido, sendo geralmente realizada em membranas cerâmicas sob o conceito de Pressão Transmembranar Uniforme (PTU). O objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho de um novo tipo de membrana (Isoflux®) capaz de manter o fluxo de permeado constante ao longo do comprimento da membrana e também o efeito do armazenamento refrigerado e da microfiltração na qualidade e vida útil do leite pasteurizado. O desempenho da membrana Isoflux, na microfiltração do leite cru, foi avaliado através da determinação do fluxo de permeado, retenção de células somáticas, microorganismos, gordura e caseína. Em geral, o fluxo da membrana estudada foi baixo, variando de 130 a 200 Kg/h/m 2. A retenção de micro-organismos mesófilos e psicrotróficos foi maior que 99 %, enquanto a retenção de coliformes foi de 90 %, e de 100 % para células somáticas. A membrana reteve, em média, 11, 2 % de caseína e 34, 6 % de gordura. O efeito do armazenamento refrigerado do leite cru (7 ºC/ 6 dias) e o impacto da microfiltração na microbiota, qualidade e vida de prateleira do leite pasteurizado foram avaliados pela contagem de micro-organismos mesófilos, psicrotróficos e coliformes, pelas alterações físicoquímicas (pH, acidez titulável e viscosidade), atividade proteolítica, ocorrência de sabor amargo e aceitação sensorial durante o tempo de armazenamento. Houve um aumento de 2, 15 ciclos logarítmicos no número de micro-organismos mesófilos e de 2, 55 ciclos para os psicrotróficos, após o armazenamento do leite cru a 7 °C/ 6 dias. Durante esse tempo, não houve alteração na composição do leite e sua viscosidade permaneceu constante. A microfiltração reduziu em 3 e 4 ciclos logarítmicos a contagem inicial de micro-organismos mesófilos e psicrotróficos, respectivamente. Não foi observada diferença significativa na atividade proteolítica, na viscosidade e no perfil sensorial do leite microfiltrado pasteurizado, durante a vida de prateleira do produto. O produto apresentou boa aceitação sensorial com média de 6, 31 para o atributo sabor, sendo que mais de 50 % dos provadores certamente ou provavelmente comprariam o produto, durante toda sua vida de prateleira, independente de ser obtido de leite controle ou com armazenamento refrigerado prévio (7 °C/ 6 d). O gosto amargo aumentou com o tempo de armazenamento, mas não atingiu níveis que resultassem em rejeição do produto. Aos 15 dias de armazenamento refrigerado, o leite microfiltrado pasteurizado atingiu uma contagem de micro-organismos mesófilos de 3 x 104 UFC/mL, o que determinou o fim da sua vida de prateleira. A microfiltração aliada à pasteurização proporcionou a obtenção de um produto com maior vida útil de prateleira, mesmo quando proveniente de leite cru refrigerado armazenado a 7 ºC por 6 diasAbstract: Extending {{the shelf}} life of pasteurized milk is a {{challenge}} and a necessity for the dairy industry. The microfiltration has been utilized {{for the removal of}} microorganisms and increase the quality and shelf life of liquid milk, usually being held in ceramic membranes under the concept of uniform transmembrane pressure. A new membrane, Isoflux, with modified thickness of the separating layer, is claimed to maintain a nearly constant permeate flux {{along the length of the}} membrane. The performance of membrane Isoflux on the microfiltration of skim milk and the influence of concentration factor on the components retention by the membrane was evaluated. Permeate flux, reduction of bacteria and somatic cells, and partition of the main components of <b>milk</b> permeate and <b>retentate</b> during <b>milk</b> Microfiltration (MF) were determined. In general, the flux of membrane studied was low, varying with 130 a 200 Kg/h/m². The retention of mesophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms was greater than 99 %, 90 % for coliforms, and 100 % of somatic cells. The membrane retained, on average, 11. 2 % of casein and 34. 6 % fat. In general, the flux of the Isoflux® membrane was low, ranging 130 - 200 Kg/hm 2. The new technical regulations require that raw milk is refrigerated on the farm. The effect of refrigerated storage of raw milk and the impact of the microfiltration on the microbiological quality and shelf life of pasteurized milk was assessed by bacterial counts (mesophilic, psychrotrophic and coliforms), physico-chemical changes (pH, titratable acidity, viscosity), proteolytic activity, the development of bitter taste and sensory acceptance during the storage time. There was an increase of 2. 15 log in the number of mesophilic bacteria and of 2. 55 log for psychrotrophic microrganisms after the storage of raw milk to 7 ° C/ 6 days. No changes in raw milk composition and viscosity occurred during the refrigerated storage. The microfiltration reduced by 3 log the initial count of mesophilic and up to 4 log the number of psychrotrophic microorganisms. There was no significant proteolytic activity, nor changes in viscosity or relevant sensory changes that might interfere with the sensory acceptance of microfiltered pasteurized milk during the 15 days of storage. The product had good acceptability with an average of 6. 31 for the attribute flavor, with more than 50 % of the panelists certainly or probably buy the product throughout its shelf life, whether it be milk obtained from control or refrigerated raw milk (7 ° C/ 6 d). The bitter taste increased with storage time, but did not reach levels that would result in rejection of the product.

40|$|Pakistan is {{the third}} largest milk {{producer}} and second largest buffalo milk producer in the world. Buffalo milk is the second produced milk with a contribution of 12. 7 % in the world’s milk production. More than 92 % of this milk is being contributed by India and Pakistan. This milk is richer in protein particularly casein i. e. 34 - 36 g. kg- 1, equivalent to the total protein contents of cow milk. Casein represents 80 % of the total protein of both milks and find as colloidal particles called casein micelles. In buffalo milk, casein micelles are bigger in size, more mineralized and less hydrated but with similar charge as compared to its counter part cow milk (Ahmad et al, 2008 a and b). In spite of the important production of buffalo milk, the technological transformations of this milk into dairy products are very limited as compared to cow milk. Some cheeses or fermented milks like Cheddar, Mozarella, lassi and yoghurts are manufactured from this milk. Protein ingredients manufactured from buffalo milk such as caseinates associated with different minerals and purified whey proteins are absent on the dairy industrial market. One possible way to obtain these types of ingredients from buffalo milk is to use cross-flow microfiltration. This operation is widely used in the dairy industry for the fractionation of casein micelles and whey proteins from cow milk (Maubois, 1991; Saboya and Maubois, 2000; Nelson and Barbano, 2005). This process produces a retentate enriched in casein micelles with a purity expressed as the ratio [casein]/[total protein] higher than 0. 90 (Fauquant et al, 1988; Pierre et al, 1992; Schuck et al, 1994). The technological behaviours of these purified casein micelles during acidification, rennet coagulation and heat treatment are also very similar to milk. For these reasons, these casein micelles purified by cross-flow microfiltration are considered as native. The objectives of this work were to apply cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) firstly, to have bacteria free buffalo milk without any heat treatment, secondly to isolate and characterize the casein micelles from buffalo milk. For this purpose, cream and bacteria from milks were removed at 50 °C through a cream separator and microfiltration (1. 4 µm), respectively. Casein micelles were then separated and concentrated through cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) followed by purification through four volume water and again concentrated through water removal. Purification was performed in three main steps: concentration of casein micelles, diafiltration of retentate and final concentration (Fig. 1). The products obtained at different steps of the process were analysed for pH, total solids, proteins fractions, minerals contents and as well for size, zeta potential and hydration of casein micelles. Figure 1 : Technological scheme for the purification of casein micelles from buffalo and cow milk by cross-microfiltrations (pore size of 1. 4 and 0. 1 μm). Microbiological analyses of raw skimmed milk and bacteria free milk after the first microfiltration (1. 4 µm) showed a great reduction of coliforms and FMAR in both milks (Table 1) so the first objective was well achieved. Table 1 : Coliforms and FMAR counts Milk Coliforms FMAR Raw buffalo skimmed milk 3. 3 × 101 7. 5 × 101 Microfiltered buffalo milk < 1 1. 5 × 101 Raw cow skimmed milk 9. 7 × 104 3. 2 × 104 Microfiltered cow milk < 1 6. 5 × 101 As the second objective {{of this study was}} to purify casein micelles from buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration, so the results have been described and discussed for each step during the process. The biochemical compositions and physico-chemical characteristics of initial bacteria-free skimmed milks and the different retentates (intermediate, diafiltered and final) have been reported as under. Results obtained with buffalo milk were compared to cow milk and discussed. Bacteria-free skimmed milks: The contents in total protein and casein were higher for buffalo milk than that of cow milk. However, in both milks, casein content as compared to the total protein content corresponded to similar percentage i. e. 80 %. To know more about the differences in the composition between buffalo and cow milk, it was interesting to compare the different ratios. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total solid] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 41, 0. 35 and 5. 3 for buffalo milk and 0. 35, 0. 27 and 4. 5 for cow milk, respectively. From these ratios, it is evident that the protein contents of buffalo milk were different than that of cow milk. The total and micellar calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations were higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk as also observed by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). The pH values of both milks were close to pH 6. 7. The size of casein micelles from buffalo milk was higher, the zeta potential was similar and the micellar hydration was lower than that of cow milk and as described by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). Intermediate retentates: The contents in total protein and casein were increased for both intermediate retentates in comparison with initial skimmed milks. A slight retention of whey proteins in the intermediate <b>retentate</b> for cow <b>milk</b> compared to buffalo milk was observed. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] increased up to 0. 54 and 0. 57 for intermediate retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] increased from about 5 for both initial milks to about 10 for both intermediate retentates. These calculated ratios indicated that the purifications of casein micelles were in progress in a similar way for both milks. The total Ca and Pi concentrations increased by 1. 7 and 1. 6 times for intermediate <b>retentates</b> of buffalo <b>milk,</b> and by 2. 3 and 2. 1 times for intermediate <b>retentates</b> of cow <b>milk,</b> respectively in comparison with milks. As discussed with the non protein nitrogen compounds, minerals and ions H+ were also able to pass through the membrane and consequently their concentrations were the same in retentate and permeate. Diafiltered retentates: The contents in non casein nitrogen, non protein nitrogen, whey protein, Ca and Pi were strongly reduced. During the diafiltration, the major part of the soluble compounds present in the aqueous phase of retentates like lactose, minerals, whey proteins and small molecules were removed. The concentration of whey proteins was lower in diafiltered <b>retentate</b> of buffalo <b>milk</b> than that of cow milk. This difference indicated that the whey proteins of buffalo milk were more easily transmitted than cow milk. On the other hand, the contents in total solids of these diafiltered retentates were strongly reduced. During diafiltration, 50. 3 and 54. 5 g. kg- 1 of total solid contents was removed from buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the end of diafiltration, the total solid corresponded essentially to casein micelles containing minerals. These ratios indicated that diafiltration was particularly efficient to increase the level of purity of casein micelles for both milks. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] were about 42. 3 and 26. 7 for diafiltered retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively suggesting a good and best elimination of the whey proteins in the diafiltered <b>retentates</b> of buffalo <b>milk</b> in comparison with those of cow milk. The pH values of both diafiltered retentates increased in a similar way by about 0. 6 units. The reduction of the ionic strength and especially Pi and citrate from the aqueous phase due to the diafiltration explained theses increases in pH. Indeed, these ions contribute to the buffering capacity of milk and their removals during the diafiltration step led to an increase in pH. The micellar characteristics of both diafiltered retentates were affected in comparison with those determined for <b>milks</b> and intermediate <b>retentates.</b> The zeta potentials of casein micelles from both retentates were more negative after diafiltration. These were related to the increase in pH and to the reduction in the ionic concentration of the aqueous phase induced by diafiltration. Final retentates: The contents in total solid, total protein and casein were increased in comparison with the corresponding intermediate and diafiltered retentates. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] were 0. 86 and 0. 89 for final retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. For the cow milk, the ratio obtained in this work was in accordance with the published values of 0. 84 (Pouliot et al., 1994), 0. 86 - 0. 88 (Pierre et al., 1992) and 0. 90 (Schuck et al., 1994). The ratios [casein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total protein] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 84, 0. 98 and 45 for final <b>retentate</b> of buffalo <b>milk</b> against 0. 86, 0. 96 and 27 for final <b>retentate</b> of cow <b>milk.</b> The last calculated ratio confirmed the slight retention of whey proteins for cow milk compared to buffalo milk. Two possible reasons can explain this difference of filtration. Firstly, the composition and structures of the whey proteins from buffalo milk are different and consequently their capacities to be microfiltered were also different. The other reason concerns the formation of a fouling layer at the membrane surface during filtration. These different calculated ratios showed that the level of purification of casein micelles of buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration was correct and satisfactory. 98 - 99 % of Ca and Pi were associated to casein micelles in both final retentates. Micellar zeta potentials were always more negative as compared to casein micelles of milks because the aqueous phase became very poor in minerals. Conclusions: This study showed that the safe and microbial free buffalo milk can be obtained through cross-flow microfiltration without involving heat and without modifying the nature and nutritional quality of milk. So microfiltration can be considered as a processing technology to have safe, sure buffalo dairy products with their natural quality. It also showed that purification of casein micelles from buffalo milk was possible like cow milk without any major problem. The biochemical analyses of the final <b>retentate</b> of buffalo <b>milk</b> showed that it contained mainly casein and minerals and that the different compounds present in the aqueous phase were well removed. These ingredients can be used in different formulations for Ca and phosphate enrichments...|$|R
