50|$|LSPRs (Localized SPRs) are {{collective}} {{electron charge}} oscillations in metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light. They exhibit enhanced near-field amplitude at the resonance wavelength. This field is highly localized at the nanoparticle and decays rapidly {{away from the}} nanoparticle/dieletric interface into the dielectric background, though far-field scattering by the particle is also enhanced by the resonance. Light intensity enhancement {{is a very important}} aspect of LSPRs and localization means the LSPR has very high spatial resolution (subwavelength), limited only by the size of nanoparticles. Because of the enhanced field amplitude, effects that depend on the amplitude such as <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effect</b> are also enhanced by LSPRs.|$|E

The method can also be applied to describe periodic multilayer systems comprising materials with any type of optical anisotropy. We illustrate the method with the analysis of a recent experiment in which the transverse <b>magneto-optical</b> Kerr <b>effect</b> was measured in a Fe film with a periodic array of subwavelength circular holes.

30|$|We {{have shown}} that the Drude-Lorentz model {{describes}} the optical properties of III-V semiconductors well. The THz-TDS and FTIR are suitable techniques for exploring properties of semiconductors in their respective ranges. The doping or intrinsic concentrations of free carriers in the measured ranges lead to a metal-like behavior. A surface plasmon polariton guided by these materials exhibits reasonable confinement and propagation length, similar to SPPs on noble metal-dielectric interface in the visible range. Thus semiconductors are suitable for the surface plasmon applications in the terahertz and far IR regime. An interesting property emerges with an applied magnetic field - a large anisotropy is induced, causing a huge <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effect.</b> That can be used to significantly modulate the optical and guided wave properties using small magnetic field at room temperature. Free carrier <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effect</b> is extremely weak in metals, due to their large plasma frequency and high effective mass and thus low cyclotron frequency. Coupled with low confinement of surface waves for THz frequencies in metals make semiconductors much more suitable for terahertz plasmonics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a model {{as well as}} experiments on spin-polarized tunnelling {{with the aid of}} optical spin orientation. This involves tunnel junctions between a magnetic material and gallium arsenide (GaAs). where the latter is optically excited with circularly polarized light in order to generate spin-polarized carriers. A transpolf model is presented that takes account of carrier capture in the semiconductor surface states. and descnbes the semiconductor surface in terms of a spindependent energy distribution function. The so-called surface spin-splitting can be calculated from the balance of the polarized electron and hole flow in the semiconductor subsurface region, the polarized Nnnelling cwent across the tunnel barrier between the magnetic material a d the semiconductor surface. and the spin relaxation at the semiconductor surface. Measurements are presented of the circular-polarir~tion-dependenr photocurrent (the so-called helicily asymmeuy) in thin-film tunnel junctions of Co/Al 1 O,/GaAs In the absence of a tunnel barrier, the helicity asymmeuy is caused by <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effects</b> (magnetic circular dichroism). In the case where a tunnel bnnier is present. the d a n cannot be explained by <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effects</b> alone: the deviations provide evidence that spin-polzhd tunnelling due to optical spin orientation occurs. In Cotr-MnAVAlAstGaAs junctions no deviations from the <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>effects</b> are observed. most probably due to the we & spin polarization of r-MnAl along the tunnelling direction; the latter is corroborated by bandstructure calculations. Finally, the application of photoexcited GaAs for spin-polarized tunnelling in a scanning Nnnelling microscope is discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>effect</b> {{phenomenon}} (MO) {{has been}} widely utilized in the physics field. When the light is passing through or gets reflected by the magnetic sample, the polarization of the transmission or reflection light would rotate a small angle comparing with the polarization of the incident light. Since reflectance difference spectroscope has the unique advantage to measure the small polarization rotation angles after passing the anisotropic samples, it has shown its great potential in the magneto-optical studies since its invention. ZnO thin film has a wide band gap and high exciton binding energy with a non-centered wurtzite structure.
