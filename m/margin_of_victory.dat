40|$|This thesis asks two {{questions}} {{in regard to}} voter turnout in the United States: 1) Does political heterogeneity within a community increase or decrease voter turnout? and 2) What {{is the impact of}} political homogeneity on voter turnout? To construct a variable that measures the politically heterogeneity or homogeneity of a community, data is used from past presidential elections on the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>victory</b> by the winning parties. If the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>victory</b> are persistently large, the community is considered politically homogenous. If the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>victory</b> are persistently narrow, the community is considered politically heterogeneous. To investigate the relationship between political heterogeneity and voter turnout at the community level, an ordinary least-squares regression model is employed testing the following model: Voter turnout = a + political heterogeneity index + county characteristics + region + μ. The data employed is county-level voter-turnout for all U. S. counties. This thesis finds that counties on either end of the political heterogeneity-homogeneity spectrum are associated with higher voter turnout than counties that are of average political composition...|$|R

The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record. Because of the effectiveness of the offense, the team did not punt the ball once, the first time this has happened since 1978.|$|E
