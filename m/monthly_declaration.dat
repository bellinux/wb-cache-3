The German teachers were to be replaced by English teachers, if the school could not be closed completely and have the children sent to a nearby school. The action to close the schools was a consequence of the new Education Act 1915 passed by the South Australian Parliament late in 1915. Section 53 of the act required that at least 4 hours of teaching each school day be in English, and required head teachers to submit a <b>monthly</b> statutory <b>declaration</b> that this had been the case over the preceding month. The legislation specifically identified German as not being English.|$|R
