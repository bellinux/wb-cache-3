Experiments are performed both for purely scattering and for absorbing aerosol. Thus this method provides a perspective to use cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> aerosol spectroscopy in field and laboratory measurements that often suffer from low particle concentrations {{and a lack of}} large particles...|$|R

40|$|A novel all-fibre cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{technique is}} proposed where a tilt fibre Bragg grating (TFBG) or long-period grating (LPG) in the cavity provides sensitivity to surrounding medium. Such configuration with an LPG as the representative was theoretically analyzed. Two spectral bands were identified employable for sensing of surrounding refractive index for a weak LPG while only one band existed {{for a strong}} LPG. A TFBG, with enhanced sensitivity compared to usual LPGs, was used in a <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> cavity of 1 m constructed with 2 fibre Bragg gratings as the reflectors and the decay time changed from 220 to 450 ns when the TFBG was immersed into water from air...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{resonant}} microcavities with ultra {{high quality}} factors {{are widely used}} for biosensing. Until now, the primary method of detection has been based upon tracking the resonant wavelength shift {{as a function of}} biodetection events. One of the sources of noise in all resonant-wavelength shift measurements is the noise due to intensity fluctuations of the laser source. An alternative approach is to track the change in the quality factor of the optical cavity by using phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy, a technique which is insensitive to the intensity fluctuations of the laser source. Here, using biotinylated microtoroid resonant cavities, we show simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift by using phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy. These measurements were performed for disassociation phase of biotin-streptavidin reaction. We found that the disassociation curves are in good agreement with the previously published results. Hence, we demonstrate not only the application of phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy to microcavities in the liquid phase but also simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift for the microcavity biosensors in the application of kinetics measurements...|$|R
