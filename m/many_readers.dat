5|$|The {{inclusion}} of a television in the original version would have surprised <b>many</b> <b>readers.</b> The BBC had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Wells {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality. Nevertheless, {{it continues to}} compel critical attention, to provoke strong identification and intense emotional reactions in some readers, and to elicit {{a high level of}} personal engagement from its critics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>readers</b> {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the automation of editorial curation of online news and blog articles based on reader ratings. Websites usually provide no guidelines {{on how to}} evaluate and rate articles; the NewsTrust project explores how doing so could improve rating precision. Building on and expanding from existing, but incomplete, research, I describe simulations of article comparison to determine how <b>many</b> <b>reader</b> ratings are necessary to distinguish between articles...|$|R

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated <b>many</b> <b>readers.</b> In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an Adventure of Tintin on the moon while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation of Destination Moon, {{the first of a}} two part arc followed by Explorers on the Moon, in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. <b>Many</b> <b>readers</b> sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the Moon was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{local police}} {{department}} {{reported that they}} received many tips suggesting possible identities for the child, those of missing girls throughout the country. <b>Many</b> <b>readers</b> online told police that the girl could be Aliya Lunsford of West Virginia, who disappeared on September 24, 2011. Lunsford would have been six {{at the time of}} the discovery and did bear a resemblance to the reconstruction of the Jane Doe, but she was later excluded from the case. The Massachusetts State Police later released statements on their Facebook pages regarding the exclusions of Lunsford, as well as Ayla Reynolds.|$|E

25|$|The {{marketing}} campaign was considered highly successful. <b>Many</b> <b>readers</b> {{came to believe}} that The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer was real. The fake Beaumont University site was bombarded with emails from fans who were convinced that Dr. Joyce Reardon, Beaumont University, and Rose Red were real.|$|E
25|$|A variant form {{usually has}} a very similar {{appearance}} and meaning as its base form. The mechanism is intended for variant forms where, generally, if the variant form is unavailable, displaying the base character {{does not change the}} meaning of the text, and may not even be noticeable by <b>many</b> <b>readers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Bian Jinyang, then 9 years old, {{published}} his first books 《时光魔琴》and 《秦人部落》under the pen name Yang Yang (阳阳). <b>Many</b> Chinese <b>readers</b> described his books as comparable to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.|$|R

25|$|In Buchwald's later years, {{his detractors}} {{characterized}} the column as hackneyed, tiresome and not funny. When the Dallas Times Herald canceled it in 1989, the editors {{did not receive}} a single letter of protest. By contrast, when the paper cancelled the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, so <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> complained that the editors were compelled to bring it back.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the {{alternative}} newspaper City Pages printed {{a cover story}} about Schneider focused on his attempts to change {{what he saw as}} the incestuous nature of the Twin Cities' poetry scene. <b>Many</b> <b>readers,</b> including established poets from the area, responded to the article, with most of the poets condemning Schneider and most general readers praising his honesty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>readers</b> {{assume that}} it was Gwaihir that led the eagles in this story; but in The Return of the King Gandalf said that Gwaihir had carried him twice before the Battle of the Morannon, while the proper count would have been {{three or four times}} if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagles had been the same individual.|$|E
25|$|Schachter-Shalomi {{produced}} {{a large body}} of articles, books, audio and video recordings.

25|$|In a September 2009 storyline which <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> also {{interpreted}} as Batiuk's addressing of the strip's latter-day bleakness, {{a group of}} parents protested a school production of Wit because the themes of cancer and death offended them. In her defense of the play, the character of Susan Smith, a Westview High teacher and drama director, was viewed by critics as a mouthpiece for Batiuk's views {{on the importance of}} dramatic entertainment.|$|E
25|$|After The Suns report, the {{newspaper}} was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> cancelled their orders {{and refused to}} buy it from newsagents; and from then afterwards many in Liverpool refer to The Sun newspaper as The Scum. Some even refuse to say the name or spell it as The S*n. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales nationally.|$|E
25|$|Either an {{ellipsis}} or an em dash can indicate aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue. Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> would assume interruption, {{although it may be}} used to indicate great emotion in dramatic monologue.|$|E

25|$|The British {{edition of}} the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions {{generally}} had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these lacked the clarity of early printings.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} form {{in which}} the Satyricon survives has tantalized <b>many</b> <b>readers,</b> and between 1692 and the present several writers have attempted to round the story out. In certain cases, following a well-known conceit of historical fiction, these invented supplements have been claimed to derive from newly discovered manuscripts, a claim that may appear all the more plausible since the real fragments actually came from two different medieval sources and were only brought together by 16th and 17th century editors.|$|E
25|$|The Patriot-News of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was {{the first}} to report on the grand jury investigation, in March 2011. The story did not receive much {{attention}} outside of the immediate area, and <b>many</b> <b>readers</b> at the time assailed the newspaper for impugning Sandusky's and Penn State's reputations. After the charges against Sandusky were filed, the newspaper was vindicated and in April 2012 crime reporter Sara Ganim and members of The Patriot-News staff were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for their coverage of the scandal.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>many</b> younger <b>readers</b> report {{finding the}} {{original}} language old-fashioned and hence challenging to read, several modern adaptations of White's {{books have been}} produced which update and simplify the language.
