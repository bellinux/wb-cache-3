50|$|Downspouts (downpipes, rain {{conductors}} or leaders) {{are used}} to convey rainwater from roof gutters to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes. These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> (often crimped with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section. These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> and into the receiving female connection located directly below.|$|E
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the <b>male</b> <b>end.</b> When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the <b>male</b> <b>end,</b> there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E

50|$|A union, {{similar to}} a coupling, allows the {{convenient}} future disconnection of pipes for maintenance or fixture replacement. In contrast to a coupling requiring solvent welding, soldering, or rotation (for threaded couplings), a union allows easy connection and disconnection, multiple times if needed. It consists of three parts: a nut, a female end and a <b>male</b> <b>end.</b> When the female and male ends are joined, the nut seals the joint by pressing the two ends tightly together. Unions are a type of very compact flange connector.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>male</b> <b>end</b> of {{a typical}} garden hose can mate with the female {{connector}} on another, which allows multiple garden hoses to be linked end-to-end to increase their overall length. Small rubber or plastic washers (often confusingly called [...] "hose washers") are used in female ends to prevent leakage, because the threads are not tapered and {{are not used to}} create a seal. Sometimes the gaskets stiffen, disintegrate, or fall out of older hoses, which results in pressurized leakage spraying from the hose; simply replacing the washer insert often fixes the problem.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in females. Although the empathy construct has been examined thoroughly in autism, {{little attention has}} been paid to empathy in adult women with this condition or to gender differences within the disorder. OBJECTIVE: Self-reported empathy in adult women with ASD was examined and compared to that of typically developed men and women as well as to men with this condition. METHODS: Online databases were searched for articles investigating self-reported empathy among adult women with ASD. Only six studies comparing women to men were identified. RESULTS: All studies found women with an ASD to report lower levels of empathy than typically developed women, and typically developed men, but similar levels to men with this condition. CONCLUSION: The self-reported empathic ability of women diagnosed with ASD resembles that of their male counterparts most closely; they show a hypermasculinisation in empathy. This is particularly surprising considering the large gender difference in empathy in the general population. DISCUSSION: One of the limitations of this review is that the current diagnostic criteria for ASD are oriented towards male-specific behaviour and fail to integrate gender specific characteristics. Hence, women diagnosed with ASD are likely to be at the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> of the continuum. The suggested hypermasculinisation of women on the spectrum, as evident from this review, may therefore be exaggerated due to a selection bias...|$|E

40|$|SummaryDevelopment {{requires}} fertilization by {{a single}} sperm [1, 2]. InÂ Caenorhabditis elegans, fertilization occurs in a sperm-filled spermatheca, implying the barrier to polyspermy is generated in this compartment. Eggshell chitin synthesis is initiated at fertilization, and chitin is deposited before the zygote exits the spermatheca. Whereas polyspermy isÂ very rare in wild-type, here we report an incidence of 14 %â€“ 51 % in zygotes made chitin deficient by loss of chitin synthase- 1 (CHS- 1), the CHS- 1 substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the CHS- 1 -interacting protein EGG- 3, or the sperm-provided protein SPE- 11. The spe- 11 (hc 90) mutant deposits chitin at the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> but fails to complete a continuous layer. The polyspermy barrier is also compromised by loss of the chitin-binding protein CBD- 1 or the GLD- 1 -regulated LDL receptor-like EGG- 1, together with its homolog, EGG- 2. Loss of CBD- 1 or EGG- 1 / 2 disrupts oocyte cortical distribution of CHS- 1, as well as MBK- 2 and EGG- 3. In CBD- 1 or EGG- 1 / 2 deficiency, chitin is synthesized but the eggshell is fractured, suggesting aberrantly clustered CHS- 1 /MBK- 2 /EGG- 3 may fail to support construction of a continuous eggshell. Together, our results show that eggshell chitin is required to prevent polyspermy in C. elegans, {{in addition to its}} previously reported requirement in polar body extrusion and polarization of the zygote...|$|E

40|$|Although much {{information}} on the endocrine activity of bisphenol A (BPA) is available, a proper human hazard assessment of analogues that {{are believed to have}} a less harmful toxicity profile is lacking. Here the possible effects of BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), as well as the brominated structural analogue and widely used flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on human glucocorticoid and androgen receptor (GR and AR) activation were assessed. BPA, BPF, and TBBPA showed clear GR and AR antagonism with IC 50 values of 67 ÂµM, 60 ÂµM, and 22 nM for GR, and 39 ÂµM, 20 ÂµM, and 982 nM for AR, respectively, whereas BPS did not affect receptor activity. In addition, murine MA- 10 Leydig cells exposed to the bisphenol analogues were assessed for changes in secreted steroid hormone levels. Testicular steroidogenesis was altered by all bisphenol analogues tested. TBBPA effects were more directed towards the <b>male</b> <b>end</b> products and induced testosterone synthesis, while BPF and BPS predominantly increased the levels of progestagens that are formed {{in the beginning of the}} steroidogenic pathway. The MA- 10 Leydig cell assay shows added value over the widely used H 295 R steroidogenesis assay because of its fetal-like characteristics and specificity for the physiologically more relevant testicular Â¿ 4 steroidogenic pathway. Therefore, adding an in vitro assay covering fetal testicular steroidogenesis, such as the MA- 10 cell line, to the panel of tests used to screen potential endocrine disruptors, is highly recommendable...|$|E
40|$|Background Females {{and males}} differ {{significantly}} in the prevalence and presentation of autism spectrum conditions. One theory of this effect postulates that autistic traits lie on a sex-related continuum in the general population, and autism represents the extreme <b>male</b> <b>end</b> of this spectrum.

Here we tested these three predictions for default mode network (DMN) hypoconnectivity during resting state, {{one of the most}} robustly found neurobiological differences in autism. Methods We analyzed a primary dataset of adolescents (n= 121, 12 - 18 years) containing a relatively large number of females, and a replication multisite dataset including children, adolescents and adults (n= 980, 6 - 58 years). We quantified the average connectivity between DMN regions, and tested for group differences and correlation with behavioral performance using robust regression. Results We found significant differences in DMN intra-connectivity 1) between female controls and females with autism (p =. 001, primary dataset; p =. 009, replication dataset), and 2) between female controls and male controls (p =. 036, primary dataset; p =. 002, replication dataset). We additionally found 3) a significant correlation between DMN intra-connectivity and performance on a mentalizing task (p =. 001) in the primary dataset.
