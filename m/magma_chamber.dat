5|$|Uniquely, Ciomadul is a {{still alive}} volcano in Eastern Europe and its craters have a {{youthful}} appearance. There {{is always the}} possibility of renewed volcanic activity if the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> has not solidified. Deep earthquake activity at Ciomadul occurs down {{to a depth of}} , indicating that the volcanic system between the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> and lithospheric melts is still active. It {{is considered to be a}} potentially active volcano.|$|E
5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals. Enriched lower crust and upper mantle might also contribute. Finally, the mixing of <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> contents with new and more mafic magma shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper contents and hotter and denser lower contents.|$|E
5|$|The last {{eruption}} {{took place}} between 32,600 and 27,500 years ago. Its date is likewise unclear. Ongoing seismic and geothermal activity, and exhalations of volcanic gas and evidence of a still existing <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> indicate that Ciomadul is a potentially active volcano.|$|E
50|$|Trachyandesite is {{the major}} {{eruption}} product of Huambo. The magmas forming this field formed in deep <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> with little modification in shallower <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> Basement lava flows have been dated at 1.05±0.04 mya. The Huambo field is located within the Arequipa crustal domain.|$|R
40|$|A mechanism, of {{formation}} of <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> that feed volcanoes is discussed. Heat conditions and dimensions of <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> which have existed {{for more than}} several thousand years may become stable. The approximate equations of heat balance of these chambers are derived by calculating the temperature T 1 of the <b>magma</b> entering <b>chambers</b> and the radii a of chambers. Calculations show that the radius of the shallow "peripheral" chambers of the Avachinsky volcano is less than 3 - 3. 5 km. Possible maximum radii of "peripheral" <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> were estimated for the Kamchatkan volcanoes of medial size. The temperature difference in their chambers may reach 100 - 200 "C. This method {{can be applied to}} the calculations of "roots" of central-type volcanoes...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{evolution and}} eruptive behavior of magmas may be controlled largely by convective processes within <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> According {{to a recent}} National Research Council Report [Committee on Physics and Chemistry of Earth Materials, 1987], “the style of convection itself, whether it is turbulent, laminar, large-scale, of multiple scales, tiered, or localized and intermittent, is very much at question. ” In the U. S. National Report to the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, Marsh [1987] reviewed recent theoretical and experimental developments related to the style of convection in <b>magma</b> <b>chambers,</b> noting both significant quantitative advances and also the many remaining uncertainties. With regard to double-diffusive convection, he stated “as ever, the critical question concerns whether or not actual <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> convect in this style. ” Similarly, Spera et al. [1986], in discussion of double-diffusive convection, cautioned against “applying results from saltwater tanks to <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E
5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes. Eruptions can last anywhere from hours to days, with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes. Although they {{are associated with}} felsic magma, Plinian eruptions can just as well occur at basaltic volcanoes, given that the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> differentiates and has a structure rich in silicon dioxide.|$|E
30|$|In {{this work}} we analyse the {{capability}} of the MT dataset presented by Piña-Varas et al. (2015) to detect the <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> below Teide volcano. To do this analysis, the 3 -D resistivity model obtained in Tenerife by Piña-Varas et al. (2015) has been modified by introducing low-resistivity bodies performing the role of potential <b>magma</b> <b>chambers,</b> according to geological, geophysical and petrological information. The variations in the data fit between the original 3 -D inversion model (Piña-Varas et al. 2015) and the models with these conductive bodies (modified models) will provide us information about the characteristics (e.g. size, location, depth) of the potential <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> compatible with the available MT data.|$|R
5000|$|Cumulate eucrites {{are rare}} types with {{oriented}} crystals, {{thought to have}} solidified in <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> deep within Vesta's crust.|$|R
25|$|In {{continental}} arcs, {{such as the}} Andes, magma often {{pools in}} the shallow crust creating <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> <b>Magmas</b> in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country rock. Over time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> must have continued recharge of hot basaltic melt into the system. When this basaltic material mixes with the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its intermediate phase.|$|R
5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The magma {{intrusion}} rate below Uturunku {{is considerably}} {{larger than the}} magma output of the Pleistocene volcano, being comparable to the magma flux of historic eruptions and estimates of magma generation rates in local caldera forming magma chambers. Evidence {{for the formation of}} such a <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> is elusive but might be hidden by the deformation activity of the APVC melt generation zone. Uturunku may be developing into a supervolcano, and a caldera forming super-eruption may occur there; this possibility has resulted in international media attention.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
50|$|Magma mixing is {{a common}} process in {{volcanic}} <b>magma</b> <b>chambers,</b> which are open-system <b>chambers</b> where <b>magmas</b> enter the <b>chamber,</b> undergo some form of assimilation, fractional crystallisation and partial melt extraction (via eruption of lava), and are replenished.|$|R
50|$|The cones have {{generated}} basaltic-andesitic lavas with SiO2 of 54.5%-59.65%. The petrology {{suggests that the}} lavas from the field formed in deep <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> with little contamination in shallow level <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> Plagioclase is {{the main component of}} most lavas, with subordinate clinopyroxene. Basaltic andesites and in lesser measure andesites contain olivine, hornblende and orthopyroxene are found in andesites and biotite only in evolved dacites. Microlithic and microcrystalline textures prevail. Some lavas have been described as benmoreites and mugearites.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePressure {{influences}} both magma {{production and}} the failure of <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> Changes in pressure interact with the local tectonic settings and can affect magmatic activity. Present-day reduction in ice load on subglacial volcanoes due to global warming is modifying pressure conditions in magmatic systems. The large pulse in volcanic production {{at the end of the}} last glaciation in Iceland suggests a link between unloading and volcanism, and models of that process can help to evaluate future scenarios. A viscoelastic model of glacio-isostatic adjustment that considers melt generation demonstrates how surface unloading may lead to a pulse in magmatic activity. Iceland's ice caps have been thinning since 1890 and glacial rebound at rates exceeding 20 [*]mm[*]yr− 1 is ongoing. Modelling predicts a significant amount of 'additional' magma generation under Iceland due to ice retreat. The unloading also influences stress conditions in shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chambers,</b> modifying their failure conditions in a manner that depends critically on ice retreat, the shape and depth of <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> as well as the compressibility of the magma. An annual cycle of land elevation in Iceland, due to seasonal variation of ice mass, indicates an annual modulation of failure conditions in subglacial <b>magma</b> <b>chambers...</b>|$|R
5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> {{like the one that}} produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, {{all of which}} have lava flows; the last one also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent flows from Licancabur and flows from Sairecabur. Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide new {{insights}} into the relationship between plutonism and volcanism, numerical simulations involving heat transfer computation were used to estimate the conditions required for the formation of large <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> within plutons that grow by vertical stacking of sills. Large <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> can develop within plutons if sill accretion rates exceed 10 − 2 m/yr. For 10 km thick plutons, the volumes of eruptible magma are large enough to feed the most voluminous silicic explosive eruptions only if magma fluxes exceed 10 − 2 km 3 /yr. Emplacement rates required for the formation of a crystal mush from which a melt layer could be extracted by compaction are only slightly lower than the emplacement rates required to directly forming reservoirs of magma that are hot enough to be eruptible. The long-term average pluton emplacement rates inferred from the geochronological data (10 − 3 m/yr) are too low to allow for the formation of large <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> However, some shallow laccoliths were emplaced much more rapidly and super-eruptions of 103 km 3 of ignimbrites associated with caldera collapse are evidence of the existence of large shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> Taken together, <b>magma</b> fluxes estimated on the basis of geochronological data on plutons and laccoliths, and on the basis of current large-scale deformation in magmatic provinces, the occurrence of super-eruptions, and the results of numerical simulation suggest that the growth of plutons is a multi-timescale process with large <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> developing during the episodes of highest magma fluxes...|$|R
25|$|Going beyond {{predicting}} volcanic activity, {{there are}} highly speculative proposals to prevent explosive volcanic activity by cooling the <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> using geothermal power generation techniques.|$|R
50|$|When {{material}} is unevenly heated, lighter material migrates toward hotter zones and heavier material migrates towards colder areas, {{which is known}} as thermophoresis, thermomigration, or the Soret effect. This process can affect differentiation in <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E
5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E
5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
30|$|These {{small and}} shallow {{chambers}} {{are located in}} the centre of the island, beneath Teide, Montaña Blanca or Roques Blancos, where a limited number of MT sites have been recorded at date. This lack of data leads to a lack of resolution, making it difficult to validate the compatibility of these chambers with the original MT resistivity model. Thus, the acquisition of new MT data in Las Cañadas caldera area is needed for the proper detection of small <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> beneath Teide, Montaña Blanca or Roques Blancos. Understanding the location and size of these shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> is very important in order to assess the volcanic hazards factors in Tenerife Island.|$|R
40|$|Plutons {{are well}} {{preserved}} <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> {{that have been}} preserved in the rock record and allow the study of magmatic processes. <b>Magma</b> <b>chambers</b> are composed of silicate magmas, crystals, and volatiles. Volatiles are a key control in driving eruptive processes, which vent greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thus {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of volatile transport within a pluton is necessary. Microscopy was used to analyze the size and density of cavities and feldspars from various stratigraphic sections of the pluton. Microscopy showed that cavities were a result of volatile partial pressure, as well as, a progressive increase in cavity size with decreasing pluton dept...|$|R

50|$|Granites are {{cooler and}} are {{therefore}} less able to melt and assimilate country rocks. Wholesale contamination is therefore minor and unusual, although mixing of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into granitic <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{trace element}} {{concentrations}} and isotopic ratios in the magma erupted on mid-ocean ridges {{may differ from}} those in the source material due to physical effects such as porous flow dispersion, exchange of trace elements between the fluid and solid phases during magma migration, and convective mixing in <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> These differences are in addition to those produced by better known processes such as fractional crystallization and partial melting. The effects of the three former processes are described. It is predicted that magma typically reaches the subridge <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> with a spatial heterogeneity only slightly reduced from that of the source material, but with a subdued variation in time. Convective mixing then further reduces the spatial heterogeneity. Application of the results for convective mixing to a recent Fourier analysis of Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 variations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggests that the falloff in amplitude of variation observed with decreasing wavelength in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge data cannot be explained by convective mixing in <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> Instead, it is postulated that this falloff is due to the mechanics of the production and/or the solid-state convective mixing of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities in the solid mantle...|$|R
