40|$|Abstract—Providing {{information}} can be expanded to include systems that deliver information-like artifacts. They provide such “things ” as advertisements, propaganda pieces, and meme artifacts. Memes {{are the subject of}} extensive intellectual debate in science and popular culture because it is claimed that parallels can be drawn between theories of cultural evolution manifested in <b>memes,</b> and <b>theories</b> of biological evolution. Memes are described as self-reproducing mental structures, intangible entities transmitted from mind to mind, verbally or by repeated actions and/or imitation. The problem is that researchers describe memes in terms of English-language text or ad hoc diagrams. This paper considers the problem that the field of memetics lacks a uniform language for examining diverse conceptualizations of memes. The paper presents a unifying diagrammatic representation used in computer science, in which all types of “claimed ” memes can be expressed and their general characteristics observed. Several examples from the literature on memes are recast in terms of this representation. The results point to the capability of the proposed depiction to express various types of memes.

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} explanations for how atonement works is nowadays often called the moral influence theory. In this view the core of Christianity is positive moral change, {{and the purpose of}} everything Jesus did was to lead humans toward that moral change. He is understood to have accomplished this variously through his teachings, example, founding of the Church, and the inspiring power of his martyrdom and resurrection. Some scholars suggest this view was universally taught by the Church Fathers in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, along with what is called by Aulén the classical or patristic view, which can be variously interpreted as Ransom or Recapitulation, or under the general heading of [...] "Christus Victor". The moral influence theory also enjoyed popularity during the Middle Ages and is most often associated in that period with Peter Abelard. Since the Reformation it has been advocated by modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant, and many theologians such as Hastings Rashdall and Paul Tillich. It remains the most popular view of atonement among theologically liberal Christians.

40|$|Up to {{this point}} many of the social- {{scientific}} discussions {{of the impact of}} Chaos theory have dealt with using chaos concepts to refine matters of prediction and control. Chaos theory, however, has far more fundamental consequences which must also be considered. The identification of chaotic events arise as consequences of the attempts to model systems mathematically. For social science this means we must not only evaluate the mathematics but also the assumptions underlying the systems themselves. This paper attempts to show that such social-structural concepts as class, race, gender and ethnicity produce analytic difficulties so serious that the concept of structuralism itself must be reconceptualised to make it adequate to the demands of Chaos theory. The most compelling mode of doing this is through the use of Connectionism. The paper will also attempt to show this effectively means the successful inclusion of Chaos theory into social sciences represents both a new paradigm and a new epistemology and not just a refinement to the existing structuralist models. Research using structuralist assumptions may require reconciliation with the new paradigm. (January 10, 1996).

40|$|Abstract Recent {{debates about}} {{memetics}} have revealed some widespread misunderstandings about Darwinian approaches to cultural evolution. Drawing from these debates, this paper disputes five common claims: (1) mental representations are rarely discrete, and therefore models that assume discrete, gene-like particles (i. e., replicators) are useless; (2) replicators {{are necessary for}} cumulative, adaptive evolution; (3) content-dependent psychological biases are the only important processes that affect the spread of cultural representations; (4) the “cultural fitness” of a mental representation can be inferred from its successful transmission; and (5) selective forces only matter if the sources of variation are random.

40|$|Conventional {{economic}} theory assumes that economic agents are rational decisionmakers {{in the sense}} that they act as if they were trying to maximize some one-dimensional criterion. A well-known body of experimental work has increasingly shed doubt on the assumption that human beings are rational in this sense, however. Recently, some economic theorists have tried to justify the assumption of rationality by appealing to a cultural analogue of natural selection. Robert Sugden’s interesting paper is highly critical of this strategy – the evolutionary strategy, for short. Indeed, some of Sudgen’s remarks might be read to suggest that Darwinian theorizing about cultural evolution is a sterile enterprise of “manipulating tautologies about replicators” that can have no relevance to the empirical question of whether human beings are rational. On this reading of Sugden’s paper, the evolutionary strategy is a failure, and, more generally, a Darwinian theory of cultural change – <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> – can have no explanatory value. Sugden’s arguments, however, do not warrant this dismissiveness toward the evolutionary strategy or toward <b>meme</b> <b>theory.</b> A better way to read Sugden’s paper, I suggest, is as a plea for empirical investigation in addition to relatively a priori theorizing. The larger interest of Sugden’s paper is less its critique of a particular application of <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> than its suggestiveness for further work in <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> generally. Contrary to the implication of some of his remarks, Sugden’s paper itself illustrates that theoretical work on Darwinian theories of cultural change can fruitfully complement empirical investigation...|$|E
40|$|Darwinian {{theories}} of culture {{need to show}} that they improve upon the commonsense view that cultural change is explained by humans’ skillful pursuit of their conscious goals. In order for <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> to pull its weight, {{it is not enough to}} show that the development and spread of an idea is, broadly speaking, Darwinian, in the sense that it proceeds by the accumulation of change through the differential survival and transmission of varying elements. It could still be the case that the best explanation of why the idea has developed and spread is the conscious pursuit of human goals. <b>Meme</b> <b>theory</b> has the potential to do explanatory work in diverse ways. It can challenge the goal-based account of cultural change directly. Other possibilities for <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> include explaining the acquisition of our goals and showing that memes and genes evolve together, each affecting the selective forces acting on the other. Raising the question of meme theory’s explanatory payoff brings out the importance of the “selfish-meme” idea and the idea of non-content biases. Both have the potential to challenge the claim that our goals are in the driver’s seat.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the applicability of cultural economy theory and <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> in adaptation studies. These theories have experienced increasing attention lately; however, so far no one has attempted to apply these theories in comprehensive analyses. For adaptation studies to thrive and develop it needs a framework that can explain why adaptations are performed and how {{they ought to be}} studied. The field can look back on a century of repeated claims, and has not yet reached a consensus of opinion; thus, recently some scholars have proposed new directions going forward. In the first section of the thesis, the theoretical background is presented, and Simone Murray’s cultural economy theory and Linda Hutcheon’s appropriation of <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> are suggested as two theories that can offer an explanation to why adaptations are made and how they ought to be studied. In the second part, a case study of the film adaptation The Blind Side is conducted according to the proposed methodology. The final part of the analysis section discusses three recent theories of how to understand and study the relationship between versions of works that have been adapted, and what the implications are for adaptation studies. In conclusion, the thesis argues that both cultural economy theory and <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> prove applicable and offer meaningful explanations for why adaptations are made, based on cultural and economical perspectives on the adaptation industry, and on the evolution of stories in society by means of replication and change. Murray proposes a methodology for the study of adaptations that stakes out a new course for the field. <b>Meme</b> <b>theory</b> is still largely unexplored and to date no methodology has been proposed, but the theory is promising and may be developed into a fruitful methodology, as demonstrated by the case study of The Blind Side. In addition, Jørgen Bruhn, John Bryant and Linda Hutcheon provide distinct, but applicable approaches to understanding why a story is sometimes adapted multiple times, and how the versions influence each other, and their points are incorporated into the proposed framework. This thesis hopes to offer a small contribution to the discourse on a new direction for adaptation studies through its analysis of the applicability of the two recently developed theories...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose: The paper {{describes}} the difficulties encountered by researchers {{who are looking}} to operationalise theoretical memetics and provides a methodological avenue for studies that can test <b>meme</b> <b>theory.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach: The application of evolutionary theory to organisations is reviewed by critically reflecting on the validity of its truth claims. To focus the discussion a number of applications of <b>meme</b> <b>theory</b> are reviewed to raise specific issues which {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical investigation. Subsequently, the empirical studies conducted to date are assessed in terms of the progress made and conclusions for further work are drawn. Findings: The paper finds that the key questions posed by memetic theory have yet to be addressed empirically and that a recurring weakness is the practice of assuming the existence of a replicating unit of culture which has, however, yet to be demonstrated as a valid concept. Therefore, an 'extra-memetic' methodology is deemed to be necessary for the development of memetics as a scientific endeavour. Narrative analysis is abducted as an appropriate avenue for the operationalisation of extra-memetic empirical research. Originality/Value: The paper highlights inconsistencies, embedded in much of the memetic literature, which have not previously been recognised and the colloquial nature of the discipline is challenged from a positive but critical perspective. Consequently, the paper develops a rationale for the adoption of a widely recognised social science methodology for memetics which has been absent to date. In proposing narrative orientated research, knowledge concerning memes' validity can be facilitated whilst avoiding the current circularity in memetic truth claims.
