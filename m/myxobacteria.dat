5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the <b>myxobacteria,</b> individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The <b>myxobacteria</b> move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as <b>myxobacteria</b> can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, <b>Myxobacteria</b> detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and <b>myxobacteria.</b> In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by <b>Myxobacteria</b> and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E
25|$|Multicellularity {{has evolved}} {{independently}} at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, <b>myxobacteria,</b> actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), {{once or twice}} for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae. Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.|$|E

500|$|The {{first model}} {{known as the}} [...] "syntrophic model" [...] proposes that a {{symbiotic}} relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern <b>myxobacteria,</b> eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory {{is analogous to the}} accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that <b>myxobacteria</b> are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.|$|E

40|$|Seven {{strains of}} the <b>myxobacterium</b> Chondromyces crocatus, {{isolated}} from widely separated geographic regions, were investigated {{for the presence of}} an associate gram-negative, rod-shaped companion bacterium that is phylogenetically related to the genus Sphingobacterium and has been named "Candidatus comitans" (C. A. Jacobi, E. Stackebrandt, H. Reichenbach, and B. J. Tindall, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 46 : 119 - 122, 1996). Five of the Chondromyces strains were found to be associated with a companion bacterium, and one strain lost its companion during the study. A 16 S ribosomal DNA (16 S rDNA) clone library was generated for each Chondromyces culture. Sequence similarity was > 99. 1 % for all but one strain of C. crocatus and all but one strain of "Candidatus comitans". The three analyzed 16 S rDNA clone sequences of the companion of Cm c 7 indicated that this companion strain is slightly less related to the other companion strains. The association between the companion and the <b>myxobacterium</b> including the sporangioles was determined by in situ hybridization with fluorescently labeled rRNA probes and scanning confocal laser microscopy.

2500|$|Some {{microbes}} are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using {{organic compounds}} as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as commensals or parasites) or find in {{dead organic matter}} of all kind (saprophages). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are heterotrophic by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and <b>Myxobacteria</b> such as Myxococcus (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of <b>Myxobacteria).</b> Most pathogenic bacteria {{can be viewed as}} heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes. [...] There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products. [...] Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in bioremediation.|$|E

One of the <b>myxobacteria,</b> Minicystis rosea, has the largest bacterial genome with16.04 million nucleotides followed by another <b>myxobacteria</b> Sorangium cellulosum. <b>Myxobacteria</b> are included among the delt{{a group of}} proteobacteria, a large taxon of Gram-negative forms.|$|E
50|$|Stigmergy {{has even}} been {{observed}} in bacteria, various species of which differentiate into distinct cell types and which participate in group behaviors that are guided by sophisticated temporal and spatial control systems. Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the <b>myxobacteria.</b> <b>Myxobacteria</b> travel in swarms containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Most <b>myxobacteria</b> are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into fruiting bodies, within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls. The fruiting process is thought to benefit <b>myxobacteria</b> by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of <b>myxobacteria,</b> rather than isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the cellular slime molds. The best known of the <b>myxobacteria,</b> Myxococcus xanthus and Stigmatella aurantiaca, are studied in various laboratories as prokaryotic models of development.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe jaspamide/chondramide {{family of}} depsipeptides are mixed PKS/NRPS natural {{products}} isolated from marine sponges and a terrestrial <b>myxobacterium</b> that potently affect {{the function of}} the actin cytoskeleton. As a first step to improve production in heterologous host cells and permit genetic approaches to novel analogs, we have cloned and characterized the chondramide biosynthetic genes from the <b>myxobacterium</b> Chondromyces crocatus Cm c 5. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes a rare tyrosine aminomutase for β-tyrosine formation and a previously unknown tryptophan- 2 -halogenase. Conditions for gene transfer into C. crocatus Cm c 5 were developed, and inactivation of several genes corroborated their proposed function and served to define the boundaries of the cluster. Biochemical characterization of the final NRPS adenylation domain confirmed the direct activation of β-tyrosine, and fluorinated chondramides were produced through precursor-directed biosynthesis...|$|R
