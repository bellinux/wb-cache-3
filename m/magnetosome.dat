50|$|Pure {{magnetite}} {{particles are}} biomineralized in <b>magnetosomes,</b> which {{are produced by}} several species of magnetotactic bacteria. <b>Magnetosomes</b> consist of long chains of oriented magnetite particle that are used by bacteria for navigation. After the death of these bacteria, the magnetite particles in <b>magnetosomes</b> may be preserved in sediments as magnetofossils.|$|R
50|$|In {{certain types}} of applications, {{bacterial}} magnetite offers several advantages compared to chemically synthesized magnetite. Bacterial <b>magnetosome</b> particles, unlike those produced chemically, have a consistent shape, a narrow size distribution within the single magnetic domain range, and a membrane coating consisting of lipids and proteins. The <b>magnetosome</b> envelope allows for easy couplings of bioactive substances to its surface, a characteristic important for many applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetosome</b> {{chains are}} {{membranous}} prokaryotic structures present in magnetotactic bacteria. They contain 15 to 20 magnetite crystals that together {{act like a}} compass needle to orient magnetotactic bacteria in geomagnetic fields, thereby simplifying their search for their preferred microaerophilic environments. Each magnetite crystal within a <b>magnetosome</b> {{is surrounded by a}} lipid bilayer, and specific soluble and transmembrane proteins are sorted to the membrane. Recent research has shown that magnetosomes are invaginations of the inner membrane and not freestanding vesicles. Magnetite-bearing magnetosomes have also been found in eukaryotic magnetotactic algae, with each cell containing several thousand crystals.|$|E
50|$|While {{a single}} <b>magnetosome</b> chain {{would appear to}} be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic {{bacteria}} have magnetosomes or <b>magnetosome</b> arrangements that depart from the ideal. One reported example includes large (up to 200 nm) magnetosomes found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells have enough magnetosomes so that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical cell of Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. There are also examples of magnetotactic bacteria that contain hundreds of magnetosomes, many more than required for orientation. One large, rod-shaped organism, Magnetobacterium bavaricum, contains up to 1000 bulletshaped magnetosomes arranged in several chains traversing the cell. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but are clustered {{on one side of the}} cell. In such an arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the <b>magnetosome</b> chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may be pointing to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes, possibly related to metabolism.|$|E

40|$|A {{brackish}} lagoon at Itaipu, Brazil, contains {{magnetotactic bacteria}} with unusually large magnetite <b>magnetosomes</b> (lengths 100 – 200 nm).

The results are consistent with theoretical predictions of the transition dimension between stable and metastable single-domain structure in magnetite...|$|R
50|$|Another {{trait that}} shows {{considerable}} diversity is {{the arrangement of}} <b>magnetosomes</b> inside the bacterial cell. In the majority of MTB, the <b>magnetosomes</b> are aligned in chains of various lengths and numbers along the cell's long axis, which is magnetically the most efficient orientation. However, dispersed aggregates or clusters of <b>magnetosomes</b> occur in some MTB, usually at {{one side of the}} cell, which often corresponds to the site of flagellar insertion. Besides <b>magnetosomes,</b> large inclusion bodies containing elemental sulfur, polyphosphate, or poly-β-hydroxybutyrate are common in MTB.|$|R
50|$|Overall, <b>magnetosome</b> {{crystals}} {{have high}} chemical purity, narrow size ranges, species-specific crystal morphologies and exhibit specific arrangements within the cell. These features {{indicate that the}} formation of magnetosomes is under precise biological control and is mediated biomineralization.|$|E
50|$|Magnetococcus marinus is {{a species}} of Alphaproteobacteria that has the {{peculiar}} ability to form a structure called a <b>magnetosome,</b> a membrane encased single-magnetic-domain mineral crystals formed by biomineralisation, which allows the cells to orientate along the Earth’s geomagnetic field.|$|E
50|$|The {{particle}} morphology of <b>magnetosome</b> crystals varies, but {{is consistent}} within cells {{of a single}} magnetotactic bacterial species or strain.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{here the}} potential of single step production of genetically engineered <b>magnetosomes,</b> bacterial biogenic iron-oxide nanoparticles embedded in a lipid vesicle, as a new tailorable magnetic resonance molecular imaging probe.

50|$|However, the {{prerequisite}} for any large-scale commercial application is mass cultivation of magnetotactic bacteria or the introduction and {{expression of the}} genes responsible for <b>magnetosome</b> synthesis into a bacterium, e.g., E. coli, that can be grown relatively cheaply to extremely large yields. Although some progress has been made, the former has not been achieved with the available pure cultures.|$|E
50|$|Several clues {{led to the}} {{hypothesis}} that different genetic sets exist for the biomineralisation of magnetite and greigite. In cultures of Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, iron can not be replaced with other transition metals (Ti, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Hg, Pb) commonly found in the soil. In a similar manner, oxygen and sulfur are not interchangeable as nonmetallic substances of the <b>magnetosome</b> within the same species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetosome</b> {{crystals}} {{are typically}} 35-120 nm long, {{which makes them}} single-domain. Single-domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. Smaller crystals are superparamagnetic - that is, not permanently magnetic at ambient temperature, and domain walls would form in larger crystals. In most magnetotactic bacteria, the magnetosomes are arranged {{in one or more}} chains. Magnetic interactions between the <b>magnetosome</b> crystals in a chain cause their magnetic dipole moments to orient parallel to each other {{along the length of the}} chain. The magnetic dipole moment of the cell is usually large enough such that its interaction with Earth's magnetic field overcomes thermal forces that tend to randomize the orientation of the cell in its aqueous surroundings. Magnetotactic bacteria also use aerotaxis, a response to changes in oxygen concentration that favors swimming toward a zone of optimal oxygen concentration. In lakes or oceans the oxygen concentration is commonly dependent on depth. As long as the Earth's magnetic field has a significant downward slant, the orientation along field lines aids the search for the optimal concentration. This process is called magneto-aerotaxis.|$|E
40|$|The {{organic matrix}} {{surrounding}} bullet-shaped, cubo-octahedral, D-shaped, irregular arrowhead-shaped, and truncated hexa-octahedral <b>magnetosomes</b> was analysed {{in a variety}} of uncultured magnetotactic bacteria. The matrix was examined using low- (80 kV) and intermediate- (400 kV) voltage TEM. It encapsulated <b>magnetosomes</b> in dehydrated cells, ultraviolet-B-irradiated dehydrated cells and stained resin-embedded fixed cells, so the apparent structure of the matrix {{does not appear to be}} an artefact of specimen preparation. High-resolution images revealed lattice fringes in the matrix surrounding magnetite and greigite <b>magnetosomes</b> that were aligned with lattice fringes in the encapsulated <b>magnetosomes.</b> In all except one case, the lattice fringes had widths equal to or twice the width of the corresponding lattice fringes in the <b>magnetosomes.</b> The lattice fringes in the matrix were aligned with the { 311 }, { 220 }, { 331 }, { 111 } and { 391 } related lattice planes of magnetite and the { 222 } lattice plane of greigite. An unidentified material, possibly an iron hydroxide, was detected in two immature <b>magnetosomes</b> containing magnetite. The unidentified phase had a structure similar to that of the matrix as it contained { 311 }, { 220 } and { 111 } lattice fringes, which indicates that the matrix acts as a template for the spatially controlled biomineralization of the unidentified phase, which itself transforms into magnetite. The unidentified phase was thus called pre-magnetite. The presence of the magnetosomal matrix explains all of the five properties of the biosignature of the magnetosomal chain proposed previously by Friedmann et al. and supports their claim that some of the magnetite particles in the carbonate globules in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001 are biogenic. Two new morphologies of magnetite <b>magnetosomes</b> are also reported here (i. e. tooth-shaped and hexa-octahedral <b>magnetosomes).</b> Tooth-shaped magnetite <b>magnetosomes</b> elongated in the [110] direction are reported, and are distinct from arrowhead-shaped and bullet-shaped <b>magnetosomes.</b> Elongation of magnetite <b>magnetosomes</b> in the [110] direction has not been reported previously. A Martian hexa-octahedral magnetite particle was previously characterized by Thomas-Keptra et al. and compared with truncated hexa-octahedral magnetite <b>magnetosomes.</b> Hexa-octahedral magnetite <b>magnetosomes</b> with the same morphology and similar sizes and axial ratios as those reported by Thomas-Keptra et al. are characterized here.

5000|$|An unequivocal {{demonstration}} {{of the use of}} magnetic fields for orientation within an organism has been in a class of bacteria known as magnetotactic bacteria. These bacteria demonstrate a behavioural phenomenon known as magnetotaxis, in which the bacterium orients itself and migrates in the direction along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The bacteria contain magnetosomes, which are nanometer-sized particles of magnetite or iron sulfide enclosed within the bacterial cells. The magnetosomes are surrounded by a membrane composed of phospholipids and fatty acids and contain at least 20 different proteins [...] They form in chains where the moments of each <b>magnetosome</b> align in parallel, causing each bacterium cell to essentially act as a magnetic dipole, giving the bacteria their permanent-magnet characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{diversity}} of MTB is {{reflected by the}} high number of different morphotypes found in environmental samples of water or sediment.

One of the more distinctive morphotypes is an apparently multicellular bacterium referred to as the many-celled magnetotactic prokaryote (MMP). Regardless of their morphology, all MTB studied so far are motile by means of flagella and are Gram-negative bacteria of various phyla: Despite the majority of known species' being proteobacteria, e.g. Magnetospirillum magneticum an alphaproteobacterium, members of various phyla possess the <b>magnetosome</b> gene cluster, such as Candidatus Magnetobacterium bavaricum a Nitrospira.

40|$|Although membrane-bounded {{compartments}} {{are commonly}} considered a unique eukaryotic characteristic, {{many species of}} bacteria have organelles. Compartmentalization is well studied in eukaryotes; however, the molecular factors and processes leading to organelle formation in bacteria are poorly understood. We use the <b>magnetosome</b> compartments of magnetotactic bacteria as a model system to investigate organelle biogenesis in a prokaryotic system. The <b>magnetosome</b> is an invagination of the cell membrane that contains {{a specific set of}} proteins able to direct the synthesis of a nanometer-sized magnetite crystal. A well-conserved region called the <b>magnetosome</b> island (MAI) is known to be essential for <b>magnetosome</b> formation and contains most of the genes previously implicated in <b>magnetosome</b> formation. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of the MAI genes in a magnetotactic bacterium, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1. By characterizing MAI deletion mutants, we show that parts of its conserved core are not essential for <b>magnetosome</b> biogenesis and that nonconserved genes are important for crystal formation. Most importantly, we show that the mamAB gene cluster encodes for factors important for <b>magnetosome</b> membrane biogenesis, for targeting of proteins to this compartment and for several steps during magnetite production. Altogether, this genetic analysis defines the function {{of more than a dozen}} factors participating in <b>magnetosome</b> formation and shows that magnetosomes are assembled in a step-wise manner in which membrane biogenesis, <b>magnetosome</b> protein localization, and biomineralization are placed under discrete genetic control...|$|E

40|$|Magnetosomes in magnetotactic {{bacteria}} (MTB) {{are among the}} most intriguing examples of subcellular structures in prokaryotes.

This work displays the first comprehensive biochemical and molecular investigations of the magnetosomes in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense. The biochemical characteristics of the MM were investigated by using various proteomic approaches to analyze the protein composition. In total, a number of 17 <b>magnetosome</b> membrane-associated proteins were found to constitute the <b>magnetosome</b> subproteome, and most of these proteins are novel for Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense.
