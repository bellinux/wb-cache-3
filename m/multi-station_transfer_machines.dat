40|$|International audienceNew {{generation}} of rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> processing different models of parts is considered. In order {{to enhance the}} costeffectiveness of mixed-model rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machines,</b> the problems of process planning for the parts to be machined and the configuration of a rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> are integrated in the same optimisation problem. This problem is modelled as a combinatorial optimisation problem. The decisions to be taken simultaneously concern the orientation of parts for machining, the machining parameters for processing the parts {{as well as the}} configuration of machining units to be used at working positions of the machine. Constraints related to the design of such units – spindle heads, turrets – and working positions, as well as precedence constraints related to machining operations, are taken into account. The problem consists in minimising an estimated cost of the rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machine,</b> while reaching a given output and satisfying all the constraints. The proposed methods to solve theproblem are based on its MIP formulation. The optimisation techniques are validated on an industrial case study.

And if you pass the vehicle at the speed limit, you can safely move into the lane ahead of it. Oncoming motorists, meanwhile, are prevented from entering the zipper's lane by the concrete barriers in front of it, and they can move into a lane after they have passed the truck.” --Ann L.

50|$|An {{important}} part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre Bézier. Bézier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a tool setter, moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the Tool Design Office. As Director of Production Engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or <b>transfer</b> <b>machines)</b> producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV. The <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> were high-performance work tools designed to machine engine blocks. While imprisoned during World War II, Bézier developed and improved on the automatic machine principle, introduced before the war by General Motors (GM). The new transfer station with multiple workstations and electromagnetic heads (antecedents to robots), enabled different operations on a single part to be consecutively performed by transferring the part from one station to another.|$|R

30|$|The {{transferring}} cost of each machine type {{between two}} periods is known. All machine types {{can be moved}} to the machine depot or any location in the cells. Even if a machine is removed from or returned to the cells, this transferring cost is incurred. This cost is paid for several situations: (1) to install a new purchased machine or a machine returned from the machine depot; (2) to uninstall a machine removed from a cell and kept in the machine depot; and (3) to <b>transfer</b> a <b>machine</b> between two different locations. <b>Transferring</b> <b>machine</b> contains uninstallation of a machine from a location and installation of that machine in another location.
