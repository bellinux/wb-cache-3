50|$|First, the accessions of {{a variety}} stored at a {{germplasm}} bank {{and those of the}} same variety <b>multiplied</b> by <b>farmers</b> are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and soil fertility constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.|$|R
40|$|Small {{ruminant}} {{production is}} widespread throughout all the ecological zones of West and Central Africa. The seasonal {{climate of the}} area influences growth and reproduction of the animals through its effects on forage availability and disease prevalence. Distribution of the breeds show evidence of ecological adaptation, the dwarf, trypanotolerant breeds being predominant in the humid areas while the larger, long-Iegged breeds predominate in the drier areas. There exist at least 11 sheep and 4 goat breeds indigenous to the regions but many are still poorly characterized. There is a great need for the standardization of breed names across national boundaries. Large gaps still exist in the available performance data {{for most of the}} breeds. Generally however, their reproductive rates are fairly high while growth rates and milk yields are low. Genetic improvement should be focussed on growth and reproductive traits. I for breed improvement on a national or regional scale, an open nucleus breeding scheme is recommended, involving central nucleus, <b>multiplier</b> and <b>farmers</b> flocks. Such a scheme should be backed by an effective extension service for maximum effect...|$|R
40|$|Most of the 25 viruses {{found in}} globe {{artichoke}} (Cynara scolymus L.) and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) were recorded from Europe and the Mediterranean basin, where they decrease both the productivity {{and the quality}} of the crop. Although, sometimes, these viruses are agents of diseases of different severity, most often their infections are symptomless. These conditions have contributed to spread virus-infected material since <b>farmers</b> <b>multiply</b> traditional artichoke types vegetatively with no effective selection of virus-free plants. This review reports the main properties of these viruses and the techniques used for their detection and identification. ELISA kits are commercially available for most of the viruses addressed in this review but have seldom been used for their detection in artichoke. Conversely, nucleic acid-based diagnostic reagents, some of which are commercially available, have successfully been employed to identify some viruses in artichoke sap. Control measures mainly use virus-free stocks for new plantations. A combined procedure of meristem-tip culture and thermotherapy proved useful for producing virus-free regenerants of the reflowering southern Italian cultivar Brindisino, which kept earliness and typical heads shape...|$|R
40|$|Sweet potato {{production}} in Central Luzon, Philippines {{has been plagued}} by a virus disease complex locally known as “camote kulot. ” Aside from causing more than 50 % reduction in yield, the disease was also responsible for the loss of an important variety with good and well-accepted agronomic characteristics. Interagency efforts resulted in a technology in the production of clean planting materials through thermotheraphy and meristem culture. A sweetpotato variety has been cleaned up, reproduced and <b>multiplied</b> for <b>farmers</b> use. CIP-UPWARD supported the use of participatory R&D approaches to adapt CPM in sweetpotato-associated livelihood systems in the region. The program implemented livelihood systems analysis, farmer field schools and farmer participatory researches. Several technical and socio-economic evaluation activities were also conducted to determine the contribution of these projects and CPM in livelihood systems. The results indicated the role of participatory approaches in facilitating project outputs and outcomes. PR&D approaches intensify awareness of research and development institutions about “kulot” and the potential of CPM in solving it leading to their provision of resources and other support to its solution. CPM were produced and used by 117 farmers in 19 villages of the provinces of Tarlac and Bataan. Local government units provided their own resources to so that their constituents will benefit from the technology. They build nethouses, finance FFS and mobilize communities leading to establishment of enterprises out of CPM technology. Unfortunately, {{there are a number of}} technical, socio-economic and policy issues that limits more widespread use of CPM and improvements in contributions of sweetpotato to the livelihood systems of households in the region. The paper also looks at the various elements of participatory research and development, how they have been operationalized within the project context and how they have contributed to achieving project outcomes and impacts. These elements evolved from UPWARD’s own field-based experiences and from efforts by other organizations to develop a wide range of participatory approaches. The paper explores the use of the following elements - problem-based agenda, impact-driven objectives, field-based action, user responsiveness, household orientation, livelihood systems framework, integration of scientific and local knowledge, interdisciplinary mode and inter-institutional partnerships, as touchstones for assessing PR&D processes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Leaf chicory (Cichorium intybus subsp. intybus var. foliosum L.) is a diploid {{plant species}} (2 n = 18) of the Asteraceae family. The term "chicory" {{specifies}} {{at least two}} types of cultivated plants: a leafy vegetable, which is highly differentiated with respect to several cultural types, and a root crop, whose current industrial utilization primarily addresses the extraction of inulin or {{the production of a}} coffee substitute. The populations grown are generally represented by local varieties (i. e., landraces) with high variation and adaptation to the natural and anthropological environment where they originated, and have been yearly selected and <b>multiplied</b> by <b>farmers.</b> Currently, molecular genetics and biotechnology are widely utilized in marker-assisted breeding programs in this species. In particular, molecular markers are becoming essential tools for developing parental lines with traits of interest and for assessing the specific combining ability of these lines to breed F 1 hybrids. RESULTS: The present research deals with the implementation of an efficient method for genotyping elite breeding stocks developed from old landraces of leaf chicory, Radicchio of Chioggia, which are locally dominant in the Veneto region, using 27 microsatellite (SSR) marker loci scattered throughout the linkage groups. Information on the genetic diversity across molecular markers and plant accessions was successfully assessed along with descriptive statistics over all marker loci and inbred lines. Our overall data support an efficient method for assessing a multi-locus genotype of plant individuals and lineages that is useful for the selection of new varieties and the certification of local products derived from Radicchio of Chioggia. CONCLUSIONS: This method proved to be useful for assessing the observed degree of homozygosity of the inbred lines as a measure of their genetic stability; plus it allowed an estimate of the specific combining ability (SCA) between maternal and paternal inbred lines {{on the basis of their}} genetic diversity and the predicted degree of heterozygosity of their F 1 hybrids. This information could be exploited for planning crosses and predicting plant vigor traits (i. e., heterosis) of experimental F 1 hybrids on the basis of the genetic distance and allelic divergence between parental inbred lines. Knowing the parental genotypes would allow us not only to protect newly registered varieties but also to assess the genetic purity and identity of the seed stocks of commercial F 1 hybrids, and to certificate the origin of their food derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Local rice {{varieties}} are commonly grown by the farmers locatedin acid sulfate soil area of South Kalimantan. In South Kalimantan, more than 100 local rice varieties can be found. In 1999, a farmer found one hill (with 5 tillers) rice plant near a canal, later called Padi Panjang. The rice had panicle lengthof 50 cm. The panicle length of common local rice {{varieties are}} 25 cm. Since the finding, the <b>farmer</b> <b>multiplied</b> the seedfor 3 {{years to get}} {{a reasonable amount of}} seeds for nearby farmers to use. In 2004, there were 25 farmers grow the PadiPanjang by themselves. Their paddocks are widely spread out in Aluh-Aluh and Gambut districts. We take thisopportunity to investigate yield variation of the Padi Panjang that may be affected by soil properties variability. Tenpaddocks out of the 25 paddock were selected. At harvest time (in July-August), we measured the rice yield andcollected soil sample from the 10 paddocks. We found that the soil condition in the selected paddocks were marginallysuitable for growing improved rice. Without fertilizer, however, the rice yield varied from 3. 21 to 8. 09 Mg ha- 1. We alsoobserved that the rice yield variations associated with tillers number. We did not find any correlation between riceyields with some selected soil properties, except it was observed that the tillers number was negatively correlated withsoil electrical conductivity (EC). The extreme yield of Padi Panjang might be explained the involvement of N fixingbacteria and P solubilizing bacteria, large rooting system and the ability of Padi Panjang root in modifying the rhizospheresoi...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{structure}} and performance of the sorghum and millet seed sector in Mali. The Sahel is the origin of pearl millet and sorghum, seed selection and management of these crops is embedded in local cultures, and most producers of these crops are subsistence oriented. Despite seed sector reform, no certified seed of these crops is sold in local markets and farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. The dominant source of certified seed is the national seed service. Certified seed is <b>multiplied</b> by contracted <b>farmers</b> and seed producer groups, and supplied to farmers through farmers' associations, development organizations, and extension services. The informal sector supplies farmers with non-certified seed directly and indirectly through village grain markets. There is no consensus about whether it is lack of effective demand or supply that constrains farmer use of certified sorghum and millet seed, but researchers generally conclude {{that the process of}} certifying seed is too lengthy, some mechanism must be established for production and trade of locally-adapted landraces, and Mali's highly structured farmers' associations could play an even stronger role in testing and promoting demand for certified seed. Recommendations have included the use of small packs and seed auctions where market infrastructure is sparse, and in more commercialized areas, involvement of agro-input dealers, shopkeepers and traders. Still, estimated adoption rates for improved millet (under 10 percent of crop area) and sorghum seed (under 20 percent of crop area) could be as high as can be expected in this challenging natural environment and institutional context.

40|$|Chickpea until {{recently}} {{was a major}} winter pulse crop in Nepal normally grown on residual moisture after harvest of rice. A severe botrytis gray mold disease (BGM) epidemic in 1997 / 98 devastated the crop in Nepal and the damage was two-fold. Not only did farmers lose their crop, they did not cultivate chickpea in the following season {{due to lack of}} seed and disillusionment with the crop. A collaborative program between the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and Natural Resources Institute (NRI) was launched on the Integrated Crop Management (ICM). The focus was on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to fight diseases (BGM and wilt) and insect-pests (pod borer) to rehabilitate chickpea in the rainfed rice and maize based cropping systems in Nepal. The components of ICM technology included high yielding chickpea variety, Avarodhi (tolerant to BGM), treating seed with fungicide (Bavistin), wider row spacing, and applying need-based sprays of fungicide (Bavistin) to control BGM, and need based application of insecticide, Monocrotophos® or tndosuljan® (Ihiodan) and biocide (Nuclear Poly neurosis Virus NPV) for the management of pod borer. In the 1998 / 99 seasons, ICM technology was evaluated in 110 farmers' fields, and large yield responses were obtained. The following season saw a five-fold increase in adoption of chickpea using the ICM package. This number <b>multiplied</b> to 1100 <b>farmers</b> in 2000 / 01, 7000 farmers in 2001 / 02, 15, 000 farmers in 2002 / 03 and 21, 000 farmers in 2003 / 04. The overall mean grain yield obtained by adopting ICM (2. 5 t/ha) was 124. 5 % greater than yield from non-ICM farmers. The increase in net income for chickpea cultivation attributable to ICM was two to six-fold. Further on-farm ICM of chickpea resulted in: 1) increase in family income by 80 - 100 %, 2) increase in protein consumption by 40 %, 3) increase in brick and mortar houses by 22 %, 4) increase in labor use by 20 %, 5) increase in household expenditures by 45 %), and 6) increase in livestock ownership by 30 %). Chickpea performance for profit and wealth was $ 216 per farmer that resulted in increase in overall wealth of 3500 project farmers by $ 750, 000. In addition to these contributions, a farmer-friendly BGM disease forecasting system was developed and village level farmer-owned seed systems and IPM schools were initiated to sustain chickpea in Nepal. The ICM technology used so successfully in Nepal also holds great potential for chickpea in BGM-prone areas in India and Bangladesh...|$|R

Approximately 80 % of the smallholder farmers in Africa depend for their seed on the informal seed system, consisting of farmers involved in selection, production and dissemination of seed. The lack of overhead, distribution and seed testing costs enables seed-producing farmers to offer seed for low prices, but seed quality is not always good. Seed-producing <b>farmers</b> <b>multiply</b> their seed on-farm without frequent seed renewal, referred to as seed recycling, which may lead to low seed quality. This research analysed the effect of seed recycling on physiological quality and seed health of cowpea and maize, and compared seed quality of the formal and informal seed system.   We tested the physical and physiological quality of cowpea seeds produced by the formal and informal seed system. Five out of six foundation seed samples, 79 out of 81 samples of farmers’ seed, and six out of six seed company samples failed to meet standards for foundation and certified seeds of the National Agriculture Seed Council (NASC), the seed industry regulatory agency in Nigeria. No evidence was found for a negative effect of seed recycling on physiological quality of cowpea seeds. We analysed 45, 500 cowpea seeds for seed-borne bacteria and fungi to compare the performance of formal and informal seed systems. All samples were heavily infected with seed-borne pathogens, including  Fusarium oxysporum (69 % of the samples) and Macrophomina phaseolina (76 %). No evidence was found that seed recycling in the informal seed system did lead to increased levels of seed-borne pathogens. We also analysed seed quality of farmer-produced maize seed to compare it with the formal seed system. The seed company samples had significantly higher germination (99. 3 %) than farmer-produced seed (97. 7 %), but not a single sample passed the requirements for certified seed of the NASC. Twelve seed-borne pathogens were identified including Bipolaris maydis (found in 45 % of the farmer-produced samples), Botryodiplodia theobromae (97 %) and Fusarium verticillioides (100 %). Seed recycling had no {{negative effect on the}} physiological quality or seed health of maize seed. We analysed formal and informal seed systems to assess the opportunities to prevent mycotoxigenic fungi infection in maize seeds. A range of control methods to avoid fungal infection and mycotoxin production is discussed in relation to three criteria for sustainable implementation in developing countries. An integrated approach is recommended, with special attention towards the local seed system. As an overall conclusion of the work it can be stated that the informal seed system did not underperform compared to the formal seed system for cowpea, but did underperform in relation to seed company samples of maize. There was no evidence that seed recycling reduces seed quality of cowpea and maize seed samples, so frequent seed renewal will not improve seed quality of the informal seed system. We recommend a new quality assurance system for the informal seed system based on seed quality testing by farmers themselves, without interference by government or external laboratories. Farmers publish their seed testing results on the bag, while buyers can retest the seed to verify the quality. Further research is required to develop and implement this system in different countries, agro-ecologies and crops, and to develop methods that enable farmers to test seed health quality themselves...|$|R
