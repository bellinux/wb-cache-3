30|$|The LiMn 2 O 4 {{nanofiber}} with porous hollow {{structure and}} morphology {{has been successfully}} synthesized by modified electrospinning method. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification. Firstly, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing 2  g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw[*]≈[*] 1, 300, 000) in 20  ml ethanol under vigorous stirring for 4  h. 1.224  g Li(CH 3 COO) · 2 H 2 O and 5.88  g Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O were dissolved into the solution. And the acetic acid (1  ml) was then added to the above solution under continuous stirring for 2  h. After that, the precursor solution was transferred into a syringe with the <b>metal</b> <b>syringe</b> needle. The 20  kV high voltage was applied across the collector (aluminum foil or luorine-doped tin oxides (FTOs)) and metal needle, whose distance maintained at 20  cm. The precursor collected on collectors was dried at 60  °C for 1  h. LiMn 2 O 4 cathode was obtained by calcining the precursor nanofibers in air under different heating rates and temperatures.|$|E

This technique, on the other hand, uses passive acoustic listening combined with active ultrasonic Doppler observation to study all aspects of the evolution. The setup consists of a <b>metal</b> <b>syringe</b> needle positioned vertically {{at the bottom of a}} water-filled tube. A small aquarium pump forces air through the needle, forming a series of evenly spaced, mm-sized air bubbles. A hollow cylindrical transducer is located around the needle and a dual-element transducer is positioned several centimeters above the tip of the needle. To continuously monitor the motion of the bubbles, I constructed a frequency-mixing-based Doppler system and used the Short-Time Fourier Transform technique. The cylindrical transducer detects the resonance of the bubble following its detachment. The Doppler setup detects both the growth an...|$|E
40|$|The {{reason why}} the issue of {{diabetes}} mellitus is a frequent topic is that diabetes is ranked among the most frequent diseases of infant as well as adult age. Diabetes has been accompanying the mankind for several centuries and the long-term research into diabetes treatment has brought substantial changes in recent years. From the original treatment, which our grand-parents still remember, by means of metal needles and <b>metal</b> <b>syringes</b> via disposable syringes with integrated needles, treatment with insulin pens, an insulin pump is becoming a great revolution in diabetes treatment. More and more diabetics are being converted to the insulin pump treatment and it is becoming a routine work of diabetologic nurses. Diabetologic nurses {{are those who are}} responsible for mastering the specifics of nursing care about diabetics during education in conversion to the insulin pump treatment. The late diabetes complication ? diabetic retinopathy {{is one of the most}} frequent indications for introduction of insulin pump treatment. The visual impairment caused by diabetic retinopathy means remarkable limitation for a diabetic in activities that might be a problem for a person without visual deficit. This is why these problems inspired me to elaboration of my Bachelor Thesis called ?Nursing care about patients with diabetes mellitus with heavy visual impairment, treated by insulin pump?. The theoretical part deals with the diabetes mellitus disease in general. It briefly summarizes definitions and the disease history, causes of occurrence and clinical picture of diabetes with complications. It also focuses on diabetes treatment. We are detailing the problems of diabetic retinopathy, visual impairment, insulin pump treatment and the specific of nursing care linked to the insulin pump treatment. The practical part is aimed at selected targets and research questions. The research sample consists of six respondents, diabetics with heavy visual impairment treated by insulin pump. Deep semi-standardized interviews were conducted with the respondents, extended by observation of the respondents during mastering the insulin pump operation. Sets of questions relating to the selected targets and research questions were prepared for all the respondents. The interviews were elaborated into case reports the research data into the output tables. Observation of the respondents during mastering the insulin pump operation was recorded into a prepared observation sheet. The output data were used for drawing conclusions and elaboration of recommendation for diabetologic nurses for providing nursing care to diabetics with heavy visual impairment, treated by insulin pump. The conclusion of the thesis summarizes the data obtained from interviews with the respondents and observation of the respondents during mastering the insulin pump operation and recommendation of possible procedures in problems arisen in providing nursing care to diabetics with heavy visual impairment, treated by insulin pump. This Bachelor Thesis may be applied as educational material for future medical staff ? students of secondary schools, higher professional schools and colleges focused on health care. It may also be used as study material for improvement of awareness among general nurses working not only in hospitals, but also external nurses from home care agencies at public seminars for general nurses...|$|R
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A <b>metal</b> tray containing <b>syringes,</b> small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts.

This study aims to evaluate {{the effect of a}} cartoon syringe on reducing the pain and dental anxiety in children. In the cross-over clinical trial, two groups with twenty-set each of cooperative healthy children aged 6 - 8 years were tested with two treatment sessions. At the beginning of appointments and following the display of the relevant <b>syringe</b> (<b>metal</b> or cartoon), the child’s dental anxiety was assessed by Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS),Venham Picture Test (VPT) and Facial Image Scale (FIS). A score of pain was evaluated by Face Scale at the end of injection. Statistical analysis of data was done using the T-test and paired T-test. Only based on FIS, a lower level of dental anxiety was shown by cartoon <b>syringe</b> comparing with <b>metal</b> injector significantly. We failed to found the pain perception associated with any type of syringe while it was increased by elevating the anxiety level.

40|$|Local {{anaesthesia}} is {{the most}} common medium for pain control in most dental treatments. Physical appearance of syringe itself can be considered as a provoking factor for the emergence of dental fear and anxiety (DFA). In this research the patient reactions to local anaesthesia application devices, as one of the main causes for DFA emergence, were inquired. The sample comprised of 120 patients, divided in three age groups, formed of 40 patients aged 8, 12 and 15 years. DFA prevalence was quantified by Children Fear Survey Schedule–Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS). Three different syringes were offered to the patients. Reasons for choosing one of the syringes were detected. Patients assigned statistically highest rank to plastic syringe. Boys chose metal and intraligamental syringe statistically more often than girls. Patients with higher CFSS-DS scores chose <b>metal</b> <b>syringe</b> as last option. None of the reasons for selection was dominant, except pain that could be caused by usage of any of the three syringes. A large number of patients did not mention any of the reasons for choosing particular syringes.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to assess {{injection}} flow rates of metal syringes, with an emphasis on injection speed and the generation of flow pulsations. A cohort of 64 operators (32 practitioners and 32 students) performed 3 consecutive ex vivo simulated injections (SIs) of 1. 8 -mL cartridges of anesthetic solution. Two needle diameters were tested (27 -gauge and 30 -gauge). Each SI was filmed and analyzed using a computer. In most cases, the SI lasted longer than 60 seconds with the 30 -gauge needle (75 %) but not with the 27 -gauge needle (47. 9 %) (P <. 0001). Practitioners and men delivered a full cartridge significantly faster than students and women, respectively (P =. 0007 in both cases). All operators generated 1 pulse in at least 1 of the 3 SIs with both types of needles, especially during the first 3 seconds (254 / 384; 66. 1 %). Pulses occurred more frequently with practitioners (P =. 0176) and with the 27 -gauge needle (P =. 005).

40|$|Phakoemulsification as a {{procedure}} is only complete with flexible foldable lens. Preliminary studies show good {{acceptance of the}} procedure though the injector is cumbersome. Phakoemulsification {{has now become a}} reality with advanced instrumentation techniques available. Phakoemulsification has to its greatest advantage the ability to remove a cataract though a 3 mm opening. Not only does this enhance the safety and the speed of healing, but it reduces postoperative astigmatism significantly. However, the very advantages listed above stand negated if the wound is to be opened to 6 mm to accommodate an implant. The extra effort needed as compared to regular extra capsular cataract extraction, the enhanced cost of the instrumentation, the more sophisticated technique needed and the superior magnification devices required were all rendered negative till the flexible lenses made their debut. With foldable lenses, phakoemulsification has come into its own. Thomas Mazaco was first credited with the concept of folding and inserting lenses. The ocular lenses were foldable with a forcep (Faulker Folder) and inserted into the eye through a 4 mm incision. It was a tight fit and the compression exerted by the forceps often left a bend on the lens. These problems led to the manufacture of a injective inserter which was in essence a single <b>metal</b> <b>syringe</b> with a piston, either longitudinal pressure or screw movement. Of these the Bartel injector was perhaps the earliest. Now virtually every company making flexible lenses has come out with an injector. The Staar Softrans injector has proven in my hands to be the most useful of all these devices...|$|E
40|$|LITERATURE 1. Previous work, {{that has}} {{led up to the}} present {{knowledge}} of artificial insemination of birds, is reviewed. INTRAPERITONEAL INSEMINATION 2. The technique of intraperitoneal insemination in pigeons and fowls is described. Data collected on- (a) 62 intraperitoneal inseminations with 21 control matings of pigeons: and (b) the first 117 intraperitoneal inseminations with 33 control inseminations or matings of fowls, which included 3421 "Hen-days" of observation before and after the operation, as well as 978 "Hen-days" of observation before and after the control inseminations or matings, showed the following results :- (1) The egg-production of the female birds was not seriously affected, {{but in the case of}} fowls it was temporarily inhibited after the operations, similar to the results of the artificial insemination by other methods (controls). A characteristic notch in the curve of recovery is reported and an explanation suggested. (2) The health of females was not affected by the operations, although under unfavourable conditions a few deaths from peritonitis occurred. (3) In fowls and pigeons the onset of fertility was usually immediate, i. e. the first ovum to be liberated after the operation was as a rule fertile if fertility was produced at all. (4) The length of the period of fertility in the fowl was similar to that reported by other workers after separation of the cocks from the hens, but the average length of the period in the 45 consecutive cases of fertility tested for duration (10 • 78 days) was slightly less than in the thirteen control cases fertilized after coitus or artificial insemination per vaginam (13 • 85 days). The maximum duration (25 days) however, exceeded by three days the maximum recorded locally in controls, although the maximum reported in the literature, 32 - 34 days, (Crew, 1926; Nalbandov and Card, 1943; Barfurth, 1896) was not attained. (5) The number of eggs fertilized from one injection in the fowl (4 • 78), showed an average figure below that of the control cases (6 • 69), in which other methods of insemination had been employed but the maximum on record (fourteen eggs; Nicolaides, 1934) was exceeded in three out of the 46 cases tested: Sixteen fertile eggs were obtained once and fifteen twice. In the thirteen control cases the number of eleven fertile eggs was the maximum. (6) The percentage of fertility of fowl eggs laid during the period between 24 hours after injection of semen and the laying of the last fertile egg in the 46 cases tested, was slightly higher (82 • 7 per cent.) than in the fertile control cases (82 • 0 per cent.). (7) The decline in percentage of eggs fertile after the middle of the fertile period in fowls was only barely detectable in the cases of intraperitoneal insemination, whereas in the control cases, it amounted to a 50 per cent. drop (Table 26). Fertility during the second half of the fertile period was considerably higher after intraperitoneal insemination than after other methods tested. (64 per cent. against 44 per cent.). The fertile periods of different lengths showed no difference in fertility following intraperitoneal insemination (Table 25). (8) The percentage of inseminations proved fertile in fowls was measurably higher after intraperitoneal inseminations than after insemination per vaginam. (9) The hatchability of fowl eggs after intraperitoneal insemination did not as a rule differ from that found after other methods of obtaining fertility, except that in several individual cases chicks were hatched from eggs laid a few days later after the day of introduction of the fertilizing semen into the hen, viz. : Twenty fourth day twice, twenty-first day once and the twentieth day thrice, than had been recorded in the Literature (nineteenth day: Nalbandov and Card, 1943). (10) The number of chicks hatched from one intraperitoneal insemination reached a maximum of thirteen, with an average of 3 • 3 in the 36 consecutive cases in which hatchings were recorded. In the 12 control cases the maximum was seven and the average 1 • 7 chicks. (11) In fowls the seasonal influences on the results were strikingly absent, under the given conditions; but the results on hens kept indoors, showed a decreased fertility, which was slightly compensated for by a better hatchability of the fertile eggs collected indoors. (12) Effects of breed, age (or conformation), on previous production and on previous insemination in fowls show that (a) fertility was better in birds of the " heavy " than in birds of the "light" breeds, but this lower fertility in the "light" hens was compensated for to some extent by a larger number of chicks obtained per dozen fertile eggs incubated; (b) second-year hens performed better than pullets in respect of the number of inseminations followed by fertility and hatchings and in percentage fertility, but pullets showed better hatchability and duration of fertility; (c) birds with a production of over 60 per cent. in the ten days prior to intraperitoneal insemination showed all round superior results over birds with a production below 60 per cent.; but the lower fertility of birds with a less than 60 per cent. previous production was again partly compensated for by higher hatchability. The egg-production of the higher producers was more seriously affected. (13) The influence of the instruments used for the intraperitoneal operation was variable in respect of egg-production and incubation results, viz. : as far as the shape of the penetrating instruments was concerned, those with less adverse influence on production: "blunt" and "fine" needles, were followed by incubation results inferior to the results from the use of "sharp" and "coarse" instruments. The contact between semen and metal parts was shown to be a factor grossly implicated in the selection of instruments for the intraperitoneal insemination technique. The elimination of <b>metal</b> from the <b>syringes</b> used, was highly favourable to the incubation results, but the wax-coating of the metal needles showed no marked benefit. The contrast between the positive correlation between fertility and hatchability percentages in connection with factors concerning the semen and the negative correlation between the fertility and hatchability encountered in connection with factors concerning solely the hen is submitted for further investigation. The conclusion is reached that all-glass (non-metal) instruments with passages of a relatively wide lumen (e. g. 1 mm.), and with blunt penetrating ends, were most suitable for the technique of intraperitoneal insemination. Two special instruments evolved viz. : (a) an all-glass syringe with long: glass nozzle (rather fragile) and (b) a modified "Holborn" sheep inseminator made to fit an all-glass insulin syringe, are described. (14) The best site for performing the operation in the fowl was a point on the abdominal wall, at the anterior border of the left pubic bone at the ventral border of the superficial muscles that pass over its posterior process. In pigeons the obturator fossa was the site of choice in view of the greater extent of the lateral air-sac. (15) The optimum depth of penetration from the best site was 6 • 0 cm. for smaller hens (e. g., White Leghorn pullets) and 8 • 0 cm. for larger birds. (16) The optimum direction of penetration was in a plane parallel to the backbone in an antero-medial direction at a ratio of 2 : 1, i. e. : 6 • 0 cm. forward for every 3 • 0 cm. in a medial direction. SEMEN COLLECTION AND INSEMINATION 3. Observations were made on 1, 163 collections of pigeon semen of which 805 were made by means of a new technique whereby excitable birds could be more satisfactorily controlled. The method was a modification of that described by Burrows and Quinn (1935) as adapted to pigeons by Owen (1941). The methods of semen collection from male fowls by fixing a receptacle to a male cloaca during coitus (Parker 1939) and by manual ejaculation (Burrows and Quinn 1935, 1937) were carried out, and a new modification of the latter evolved, by which 292 consecutive collections were executed of which 98 • 6 per cent. were successful. An average of 0 - 45 c. c. semen per collection was obtained by this method including the primary failures, and no assistance was required for the holding of the birds or the semen receptacles. A wire leg-holder for the control of birds without assistance was evolved. (a) The semen of pigeons had a density of approximately 2 million sperms per c. mm. when collected with a pipette direct from the vent. The volume obtained averaged 0 • 005 c. c. A relatively small number of racing homer pigeons proved to be good semen producers. There was a very large variation between individual birds and separate collections. One bird produced markedly pathological spermatozoa for a time. (b) The semen of fowls was measured, examined and tested during all seasons in the first, third and fourth series of inseminations, using a variety of males which supplied semen with- (1) an average volume of 0 • 45 c. c. per. collection; (2) a viscosity which varied in different males and in the same male at different collections, from a watery semen to a thick oily semen, estimated to run 0 • 25 times as fast as water through a glass tube of 0 • 2 mm. bore at room temperature; (3) the colour of pure semen was as a rule ivory white; (4) the percentage of samples soiled varied in different males to average about one quarter, when untrained males were included; (5) motility in fresh samples at room temperature was almost 100 per cent. progressive in all samples tested. (6) The estimated density of the samples varied between one million and 5 • 5 million sperms per c. mm. but in the small number of samples checked by haemocytometer counts, the density was found to be usually higher than the rough estimate from semen smears, 7 • 9 million per c. mm. being the maximum counted. Two samples counted by the technique of milk-" Breed "-clump-counts, showed a figure of 8 • 5 millions. (7) the pH measurements on semen by the "B. D. H. Capillator" gave readings of 7 • 1 to 7 • 4. Accurate determinations with "Beckman's pH meter" gave readings of 7 • 0 to 7 • 4; (8) morphological abnormalities were very rarely observed and only occurred in large numbers in the semen samples from a very young cockerel and a relatively infertile but not sterile cock. The most striking abnormality noticed was the curled up head which was often also seen in semen samples aged in vitro. (9) the fertilizing qualities of semen samples were tested in a total of 220 intraperitoneal inseminations and 71 control matings and inseminations on 81 hens used in the first, third and fourth series of inseminations with the following results: - (i) The fertility of semen samples inseminated by the intraperitoneal method was higher for most males, than from samples introduced into the vagina, and the duration and percentage hatchability in the largest group (cock No. 6 Table 48), was also higher for intraperitoneal insemination. (ii) Larger doses of semen were followed by better fertility and a fertile period of longer duration. (Table 49.) (iii) The samples of semen subjected to storage and dilution gave a markedly lower fertility than fresh samples (Tables 51 and 52) although storage up to 2 hours under liquid paraffin had little effect. (iv) The results of insemination with mixed samples of semen were often inferior to those with pure separate semen and provided some evidence that a mixed semen sample tends to be reduced to the quality of the poorest of its components, rather than that the poor quality of a given sample of semen can be offset by admixture with semen of better quality. Except in two isolated instances in the third series of inseminations all the chicks hatched from each insemination with a mixed sample of semen, were the progeny of only one of the males which contributed semen to the sample. (v) Simultaneous insemination with different samples of semen, with different instruments by the intraperitoneal method had results in agreement with the findings mentioned earlier: - (i) Deposition of the semen in the region of the ovary was more successful in producing fertility, than deposition in the posterior peritoneal cavity near the point of entry, irrespective of which was the larger dose. (ii) The coarse needle was more favourable to successful insemination than the fine needle (Table 56). (iii) Pure semen produced fertility although injected through a fine needle, whereas mixed semen injected through a coarse needle into the same bird at the same time, failed (Table 57) to be successful. (vi) Insemination with different samples of semen by the various methods showed that- (i) the fertilizing quality of semen was more important than the route of introduction in determining which of two kinds of sperm would gain the advantage in the competition for fertilization of ova when present in the hen at the same time (table 58); (ii) the same was true in respect of the doses of semen used, unless smaller doses than 0 • 1 c. c. were given; (iii) the superior fertilizing quality of a given semen sample, was lost on admixture with a sample of indifferent quality. STORAGE OF SPERMATOZOA IN THE HEN 4. Storage of fowl spermatozoa in vivo in the body of the fertile hen was studied by examinations made on thirty-three hens during the first, third and fourth series of inseminations. A new technique was evolved whereby sperm cells could be picked up from serous and mucous surfaces by means of capillary action of small, very fine, glass tubes. (1) The lumen of the infundibulum was the only locality where spermatozoa were demonstrated in a morphologically normal and progressively motile state, during the period 3 to 14 days (72 to 336 hours) following insemination by various methods. (2) The discovery of sperm concentrations contained in the mucosa of the chalaziferous region in the infundibulum in one hen eight days after intraperitoneal insemination has been confirmed by demonstration of similar structures containing sperm in two hens four and six days after natural copulation and separation from the male. (3) The term "Spermnests" has been proposed for this structure and the significance of this finding is discussed. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

30|$|Polymer nanofibres are {{prepared}} by electrospinning a polymer solution, with a high-voltage electric field {{applied to a}} polymer solution ejected from a <b>metal</b> <b>syringe</b> needle. Electrospinning is when the electric forces are utilised within the polymer solution to produce the varied morphology. Moreover, by varying viscosity, surface tension, molecular structure, molecular weight, solution concentration, solvent structure, additive and operational conditions such as rotating speed, spinning head diameter, nozzle diameter and nozzle-collector distance of the same solution may produce a nanofibre web with the various fineness, orientation and surface morphology (Zhang and Lu 2014). Many researchers focus on how to synthesise high surface area nanofibres (less than 1000 [*]nm), which make them useful in fuel cell membranes, tissue engineering, catalysis, sensors, separations, electrochemical cells, drug delivery and chemical filtration (Choi et al. 2008). Some of the researchers also focus on the proton conductivity of electrospun nanofibrous mats (Choi et al. 2008). Nafion® membrane is a perfluorinated state-of-the-art polymer developed by DuPont in the 1970 s. Nafion® at low temperature maintained a high proton conductivity and chemical resistance due to its hydrophobic tetrafluoroethylene backbone and sulfonate groups. Electrospinning Nafion® solution increases the proton conductivity of nanofibres with the reduced nanometre scale (Dong et al. 2010). Electrospinning the plain Nafion® solution is impossible due to the low shear viscosity that makes Nafion® aggregates in the solution (Tran and Kalra 2013; Zhou et al. 2010). Nafion® solution was blended with other polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (Ballengee and Pintauro 2011), poly(acrylic) (PAA) (Mauritz and Moore 2004), or poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) (Chraska et al. 2000) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (Tran and Kalra 2013; Sharma et al. 2014) {{in order to enhance}} the mechanical properties and electrospinning. Furthermore, blending Nafion® solution with electron-conducting polymers may enhance their protons’ conductivity and their electrons. PAN is mostly the chosen copolymer for the preparation of fibrous filter media as it can be fabricated easily into nanofibres by electrospinning due to their superior mechanical properties, excellent weatherability and chemical stability (Nie et al. 2013). Moreover, PAN also maintains a good thermal stability at a higher temperature of 130 [*]°C and has a good resistance to many organic solvents. PAN has been studied as a separator material, and PAN-based separators show promising properties, including high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability, high electrolyte uptake and good compatibility, with lithium metal (Gopalan et al. 2008). Electrospinning of composited PAN nanofibres has been found to have multifaceted applications (Sahay et al. 2012), such as electrode materials in supercapacitors and fuel cells (Kim et al. 2004). Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) has several properties that make it a useful material. These properties include high density, hardness, electrical conductivity, wear resistance, high fracture toughness, low thermal conductivity and relatively high dielectric constant. Because of its high refractive index and high oxygen-ion conduction, ZrO 2 has been applied as resistive heating elements, oxygen sensors, catalysts and fuel cells (Chraska et al. 2000). The use of a totally stabilised zirconia in fuel-cell technology obtains a good ionic conductivity of cubic zirconia at medium and high temperatures (Jones and Rozière 2001). Zirconium phosphates (ZrPs) are inorganic cation-exchange material with high thermal stability. Zirconium phosphate has the features of increasing conductivity due to high proton mobility on the surface of its particles and good water retention. The reduced methanol permeability of the polymer membrane, while maintaining a high power density, is obtained by impregnating it with zirconium phosphate (Jones and Rozière 2001; Carriere et al. 2003). In this work, we study the effect of ZrP nanofillers on the improvement of the morphology and conductivity of blended Nafion®-PAN nanofibres compared with pure PAN nanofibres, which can be fabricated by electrospinning into nanofibre mats.|$|E
