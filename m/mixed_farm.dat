There are frontage roads {{on both sides of}} the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US41/US141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and Abrams in Oconto County. At Abrams, US141 splits from US41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the Oconto River in Stiles south of the interchange with WIS22. The freeway bypasses Lena to the east and continues north through <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US141 continues to the Marinette County communities of Coleman and Pound as an expressway. Through Coleman and Pound there is also a Business US141. Past the latter town, US141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>farming</b> {{systems have}} {{potential}} agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over specialized farming systems. This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. A <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system at regional level {{is characterized by}} intensive cooperation between two or more specialized farms, each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such a <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a specialized arable farm, a specialized dairy farm and both combined into a <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system was assessed in a qualitative way. In the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, labour income per ha was 25 % higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The remaining 30 % resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both specialized farms {{and that of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system could not be found. It was concluded that in a <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, it is possible to realize a higher income without increasing environmental pollution. Key factor is the ratio between animal and arable production, determining the extent to which crop rotations can be widened and the relative amounts of slurry that can be applied to grassland...|$|R
5|$|On {{the east}} side of town, M-55 leaves the freeway and turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two {{highways}} approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt.

Hence, the present study was conducted in Tafresh area of Iran to examine factors influencing participation of rural women in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> activities in 1999. This was a descriptive- correlation research project in which a total number of 300 rural women were selected through stratified random sam-pling technique and interviewed. A questionnaire was used as measurement tool for which the reliability coefficient was 0. 90. According to the findings, sixteen characteristics of ru-ral women had significant relationships with their overall participation in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming.</b> Nine variables, namely, women’s age, husband’s age, crop farming experience, animal husbandry experience, perceived role overload, total energy expenditure, energy expendi-ture in animal husbandry, time spent in animal husbandry and time spent in mixed farm-ing were positively and significantly correlated with overall participation of rural women in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming.</b> Whereas, energy expenditure in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> activities, women’s education, husband’s education, animal ownership, extension contact, energy and time spent in household activities were negatively and significantly correlated with the overall participation of rural women in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming.</b> Stepwise regression analysis revealed that 48 per cent of variation in the overall participation of rural women in <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> was explained by three variables: marital status, woman’s education and time spent in animal husbandry...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>farming</b> systems {{involving}} {{varying degrees}} of crop–livestock integration are found {{in many parts of}} Sub-Saharan Africa. 1 Increasing population combined with climatic, economic, social, and institutional changes are transforming systems for producing crops and livestock—from systems based on extensive, shifting cultivation and grazing to ones that are more intensively managed and are based on <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> systems. A variety of economic and biological interactions between crops and livestock make <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> systems attractive to farmers. <b>Mixed</b> <b>farming</b> is a risk-coping strategy, with livestock providing an important avenue for farm diversification and consumption smoothing. Animals furnish manure to sustain crop yields, while crop residues and forage on fallow lands provide feed for livestock. As demographic pressure increases or new market opportunities arise, more intensive modes of agricultural production that involve increased use of labor per unit of land are sometimes adopted. The use of animal power at this stage can alleviate labor shortages, improve the quality and timeliness of farmin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims at {{examining the}} benefits of <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness to strengthen food sustainability of poor farmer households at agro-tourism areas. The research is designed using a case study method based on qualitative and quantitative approach. This research is intentionally conducted in Karangreja Sub-district, Purbalingga Regency of Central Java Province.  Based on the research results, it shows that <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness may provide the practical and economic benefits to strengthen food sustainability of the 12 adopting farmer households as the research respondents.

Furthermore, the development of <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness also directly provides practical benefits to 67 percent of respondents in obtaining several food types, including corn and chicken. The other research results show that all respondents who have been well implemented <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness management may indirectly obtain the economic benefits, especially to the staple food providers of rice since those respondents generally first sell their <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness yields in order to purchase rice.

40|$|Agriculture is a {{topic of}} concern for rural {{development}} programs in Kenya {{because of the high}} poverty incidents among farmers. Fundamentally, smallholder agriculture contributes substantially to total agricultural production and total employment.

This paper therefore aims at establishing the entrepreneurial indicators of farming activities that lead to improved rural livelihoods.
