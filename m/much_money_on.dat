25|$|When the Supreme Court Building {{opened in}} 1935, McReynolds, {{like most of}} the other justices, refused to move his office into the new building; he {{continued}} to work out of the office he maintained in his apartment. His reason was that with the country in the turmoil of the Great Depression, it was unconscionable to have spent so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> a single building.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E

He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the album." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E

The promotion was rigged, as was said in the episode, where every game card was {{to be in an}} event that [...] "Communists never lose". However, almost immediately after that is said, word of the boycott is spread and the rigging backfires.

2500|$|While the Chaparrals {{had been}} {{modestly}} successful on the court, they were sinking financially by their third season, {{largely because the}} ownership group refused to spend <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the team. After missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time in their existence in the 1972–73 season, nearly all of the owners wanted out. A group of 36 San Antonio businessmen, led by Manager/Angelo Drossos, Chairman of the Board/John Schaefer and President/Red McCombs, worked out a [...] "lend-lease" [...] deal with the Dallas ownership group. Drossos and his group would lease the team for three years and move it to San Antonio, and agreed to return the team to Dallas if no purchase occurred by 1975.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the games tended to be low scoring, {{dominated}} by such pitchers as Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, and Grover Cleveland Alexander {{to the extent that}} the period 1900–1919 is commonly called the [...] "Dead-ball era". The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. Baseballs cost three dollars apiece, which in 1900 would be equal to $ today; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> new balls if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game. By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat. Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands—a practice unthinkable today.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{recording}} of the album, The Byrds' record producer, Gary Usher, who had worked on the band's three previous albums, had been fired by Columbia Records for spending too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> {{the recording}} of the Chad & Jeremy album, [...] Of Cabbages and Kings. [...] Faced {{with the need to}} find a replacement producer, The Byrds elected to bring in Bob Johnston, who had been Bob Dylan's producer since 1965. [...] Ultimately, the band were unhappy with Johnston's production work on Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde and as a result, it was the only Byrds' album to be produced by him. [...] However, Johnston was employed once more as the band's producer on their May 1969 non-album single, [...] "Lay Lady Lady". [...] He incurred the band's wrath, however, by overdubbing a female choir on to that recording, allegedly without The Byrds' consent. [...] When the single then stalled at number 132 on the Billboard charts the band decided that they would not work with Johnston again.|$|E
2500|$|The Tenderloin {{took its}} name from an older {{neighborhood}} in New York with similar characteristics. There are several explanations of how that neighborhood was named. Some {{said it was a}} reference to the neighborhood as the [...] "soft underbelly" [...] (analogous to the cut of meat) of the city, with allusions to vice and corruption, especially graft. Another popular explanation, probably folklore, attributes the name to a New York City police captain, Alexander S. Williams, who was overheard saying that when he was assigned {{to another part of the}} city, he could only afford to eat chuck steak on the salary he was earning, but after he was transferred to this neighborhood he was making so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the side soliciting bribes that now he could eat tenderloin instead. Another version of that story says that the officers who worked in the Tenderloin received a [...] "hazard pay" [...] bonus for working in such a violent area, and thus were able to afford the good cut of meat. Yet another story, also likely apocryphal, is that the name is a reference to the [...] "loins" [...] of prostitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Carlson's {{abundant}} culinary skills, {{his restaurant}} Schwa {{has struggled to}} stay afloat. Carlson has described the restaurant as living [...] "from paycheck to paycheck". This {{has been attributed to}} a complete lack of business acumen, and is a source of frustration for Achatz and Trotter. Despite long reservation waiting lists, on any given night Schwa is usually half empty, partly by choice, partly because Carlson rarely answers the phone. The restaurant's voice mail is frequently full, meaning potential customers are unable to make, or cancel, reservations. Schwa does not have a liquor license, which takes away a large source of potential income (and an even larger source of potential profit). [...] Carlson has claimed limited size of Schwa makes storing wine bottles and glasses difficult, and that it allows him to be educated by the sophisticated customers who bring in their own wines. [...] Achatz called Carlson's decision not the offer wine [...] "stupid," [...] while Trotter said he was [...] "crazy" [...] for [...] "leaving so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the friggin' table." [...] For a portion of 2007, Carlson even closed Schwa on Saturdays – traditionally the most profitable day for restaurants – to spend time with his family.|$|E

2500|$|Jean Chrétien testified for the Gomery {{commission}} {{regarding the}} sponsorship scandal in February 2005. Earlier that year his lawyers tried, but failed, to have Justice John Gomery {{removed from the}} commission, arguing that he lacked objectivity. Chrétien contends that the Gomery commission {{was set up to}} tarnish his image, and {{that it was not a}} fair investigation. He cites comments Gomery made calling him [...] "small town cheap", referring to the management of the sponsorship program as [...] "catastrophically bad", and calling Chuck Guité a [...] "charming scamp". Subsequent to the release of the first report, Chrétien has decided to take an action in Federal Court to review the commission report on the grounds that Gomery showed a [...] "reasonable apprehension of bias", and that some conclusions didn't have an [...] "evidentiary" [...] basis. Chrétien believes that the appointment of Bernard Roy, a former chief of staff to former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney, as chief counsel for the commission was a mistake, as he failed to call some relevant witnesses such as Don Boudria and Ralph Goodale. In his report of November 1, 2005 on responsibility for the sponsorship scandal, Justice Gomery ruled that Chrétien was not responsible for the awarding of advertising contracts in Quebec in which millions were stolen, but did accept Charles Guité's claim that he received his instructions on what program to sponsor and to spend how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> each program from Jean Pelletier, the chief of staff at the PMO between 1993 and 2001 and Jean Carle, the director of operations at the PMO between 1993 and 1998 as the truth.|$|E
