Her parents, Kathleen Krahenbuhl and Mose Winston Godwin, were both from North Carolina, but visiting cousins in Alabama when Godwin was born. Godwin's parents {{divorced}} two years later. After the breakup, Gail and her mother {{moved in with her}} grandparents in Durham, North Carolina. They moved again to Weaverville, NC and then to Asheville, NC. Her grandfather died in 1939, so Godwin was raised by her <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother</b> in Asheville, where they lived until 1948.|$|E

5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother.</b> She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bute {{was brought}} up at Dumfries House by his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother,</b> but {{following}} their deaths he passed into the care of his grandfather, the 1st Marquess of Bute, and travelled with him across England and Europe. His family considered him to be clever {{and he went to}} study at Christ's College in Cambridge in 1809. Over the next few years he visited the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Russia, taking a keen interest in land economics. He developed an eye condition during this period and became partially blind, leaving him unable to travel without assistance or to tolerate bright lights, and finding it difficult to read or write.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother</b> {{became the first}} women to be allowed into the Senate, and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus ("Mother of the army camp and of the Senate"). They held the title of Augusta as well, suggesting {{that they may have}} been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised great influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, and can be found on many coins and inscriptions—a rare honor for Roman women.|$|E

40|$|Intake of sugary {{beverages}} {{is strongly}} associated with weight gain and obesity among children; however, differences between mothers' and grandmothers' attitudes and practices concerning young children's beverage consumption remain unclear. This is notable since {{about a quarter of}} families in the US and the UK rely on grandparents as the main providers of informal childcare. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine mothers' and maternal grandmothers' attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding preschool-age children's beverage consumption. The analysis focuses on identifying intergenerational similarities and differences, given the potential impact that such differences might have on young children's beverage consumption habits. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews, representing eleven families, were analyzed using thematic analysis. The sample included all mother-maternal grandmother dyads from The Grandparents Study, which took place in Eugene, Oregon, USA. More than half of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> met overweight/obesity criteria. Among the children (mean age 4. 7 years; five girls and six boys), seven met overweight/obesity criteria. Most <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> were unemployed, <b>and</b> reported an annual household income below 30, 000 USD. The analysis identified three thematic categories: 1) <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> agree about the hierarchy of healthiness between and within beverages, though juice occupies an ambivalent position; 2) <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> cite role modeling and the home environment as important in regulating preschoolers' beverage intake; 3) <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> balance between restricting sugar-sweetened beverages and using these beverages as treats. The results suggest that when <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmothers</b> use soda, juice, and juice-drinks as treats, they do so within a wider dynamic of balancing practices, and within two intersecting domains: the hierarchy of beverages, including the still ambivalent status of juice as healthy or unhealthy, and the definition of 'special occasion'...|$|R
5|$|Parsons {{graduated}} from University School in 1933, and moved with his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother</b> {{to a more}} modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College {{with the hope of}} earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandmother</b> loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
