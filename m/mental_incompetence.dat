5000|$|Lack of {{disposing}} {{mind and}} memory or testamentary capacity claims {{are based on}} assertions that the testator lacked mental capacity when the will was drafted, {{and they are the}} most common types of testamentary challenges. Testamentary capacity in the United States typically requires that a testator has sufficient mental acuity to understand the amount {{and the nature of the}} property, the family members and the loved ones who would ordinarily receive such property by the will, and (c) how the will disposes of such property. It is a very low standard, and one may possess testamentary capacity but still lack mental capacity to sign other contracts. Other nations like Germany may have more stringent requirements for writing a will. Lack of <b>mental</b> capacity or <b>incompetence</b> is typically proven by medical records, irrational conduct of the decedent, and the testimony of those who observed the decedent at the time the will was executed. Simply because an individual has a form of mental illness or disease, undergoes mental health treatment after repeated suicide attempts, or exhibits eccentric behavior, does not mean the person automatically lacks the requisite mental capacity to make a will. Furthermore, a testator with serious dementia may have [...] "lucid periods" [...] and then is capable of writing or modifying a will.|$|R

40|$|No sponsorships or {{competing}} interests have been disclosed for this article. Objective. Solid silicone augmentation mentoplasty {{is a common}} procedure with consistent aesthetic results in prop-erly selected patients. While many plastic surgeons employ the external approach, the intraoral method affords excellent aes-thetic outcomes while avoiding an external scar. This is the largest series in the literature describing the midline intraoral incision approach with minimal disruption of soft tissues. Study Design. Case series. Setting. Academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. One hundred twenty-five patients under-went chin augmentation with solid silicone implants between 2004 and 2010. Among these implants, 105 were placed transo-rally. Eighty-five patients were followed for at least 1 year. Demographic information, indications, patient satisfaction ques-tionnaire results, and complications were recorded. Results. All implants yielded satisfactory results with no displa-cement, infection, tissue reaction, lower lip <b>incompetence,</b> <b>mental</b> nerve injury, or intraoral implant contamination. Two cases of superficial mucosal irritation at the suture site were observed and resolved without consequence. Symmetry, pro-jection, and overall balance of facial components were excel-lent. Although all patients {{were satisfied with the}} functional and aesthetic results, 20 % stated they would like further aug-mentation. Patients were extremely satisfied with the lack of an external scar. Conclusions. Based on our series, the intraoral technique with a midline incision avoiding disruption of the mentalis muscle is recommended for its ease, simplicity, patient satis-faction, low complication rate, and circumvention of an external scar. The external approach should be considered in cases that require a very large implant. Keywords chin augmentation, augmentation mentoplasty, facial implants, microgeni...|$|R
40|$|Two {{prominent}} historians, David Cannadine and Brad Gregory, {{have recently}} contended {{that history is}} distorted by overemphasis on human difference and division across time and space. This problem has been acute in studies of Native-Newcomer relations, where exaggeration of Native pre-contact stability and post-contact change further emphasized Native-Newcomer difference. Although questioned in economic, social and political spheres, emphasis on cultural difference persists. To investigate the problem, {{this study examined the}} Algonquian wihtiko (windigo), an apparent exemplar of Native-Newcomer difference and division. With a focus on the James Bay Cree, this study first probed the wihtiko phenomenon’s Native origins and meanings. It then examined post- 1635 Newcomer encounters with this phenomenon: from the bush to public opinion and law, especially between 1815 and 1914, and in post- 1820 academia. Diverse archives, ethnographies, oral traditions, and academic texts were consulted. The cannibal wihtiko evolved from Algonquian attempts to understand and control rare but extreme mental and moral failures in famine contexts. It attained mythical proportions, but fears of wihtiko possession, transformation and violence remained real enough to provoke pre-emptive killings even of family members. Wihtiko beliefs also influenced Algonquian manifestations and interpretations of generic mental and moral failures. Consciously or not, others used it to scapegoat, manipulate, or kill. Newcomers threatened by moral and mental failures attributed to the wihtiko often took Algonquian beliefs and practices seriously, even espousing them. Yet Algonquian wihtiko behaviours, beliefs and practices sometimes presented Newcomers with another layer of questions about <b>mental</b> and moral <b>incompetence.</b> Collisions arose when they discounted, misconstrued or asserted control over Algonquian beliefs and practices. For post-colonial critics, this has raised a third layer of questions about intellectual and moral incompetence. Yet some critics have also misconstrued earlier attempts to understand and control the wihtiko, or attributed an apparent lack of scholarly consensus to Western cultural incompetence or inability to grasp the wihtiko. In contrast, this study of wihtiko phenomena reveals deeper commonalities and continuities. They are obscured by the complex evolution of Natives’ and Newcomers’ struggles to understand and control the wihtiko. Yet hidden in these very struggles and the wihtiko itself is a persistent shared conviction that reducing others to objects of power signals mental and moral failure. The wihtiko reveals cultural differences, changes and divisions, but exemplifies more fundamental commonalities and continuities...|$|R

2500|$|Once these federal habeas {{proceedings}} had ended, {{the state}} trial judge, Steven Ables, set an execution date of February 5, 2004.

[...] On February 4, 2004, the federal district court stayed Panetti's execution {{in order to allow}} the state courts to adjudicate Panetti's claim of <b>mental</b> <b>incompetence.</b> The state trial court, in turn, appointed two mental health experts to evaluate Panetti. Lawyers defending Panetti were given a one-week notice to also acquire mental health experts to also evaluate Panetti. Both of the experts for the state concluded that Panetti was malingering in order to avoid execution. Panetti responded by arguing that the trial court's procedures did not comply with the procedures set forth in Ford v. Wainwright. The state trial court responded by closing the case, ruling that Panetti did not show he was incompetent to be executed. [...] He did not appeal to either the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
