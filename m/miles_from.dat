40|$|Background: Technological {{advances}} (e. g. directional drilling, hydraulic fracturing), {{have led}} to increases in unconventional natural gas development (NGD), raising questions about health impacts. Objectives: We estimated health risks for exposures to air emissions from a NGD project in Garfield County, Colorado {{with the objective of}} supporting risk prevention recommendations in a health impact assessment (HIA). Methods: We used EPA guidance to estimate chronic and subchronic non-cancer hazard indices and cancer risks from exposure to hydrocarbons for two populations: (1) residents living> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> wells and (2) residents living ≤ <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> wells. Results: Residents living ≤ <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> wells are at greater risk for health effects from NGD than are residents living> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> wells. Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤ <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0. 4. fo...|$|R
