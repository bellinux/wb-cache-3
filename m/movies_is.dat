The episode was the fifty-second of the series, a number that allows for an even distribution of reruns of the series; Small noted that the technique is normally used on animated children's shows, though Home <b>Movies</b> <b>is</b> actually created for an adult audience.|$|E
5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against opposing forces. However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' that shows the motions and voices of the officers. A gallery of character artworks and game <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E

50|$|Distinct {{from the}} centers are the {{locations}} where <b>movies</b> <b>are</b> filmed.

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> how conventional they are, and then you have people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said, [...] "The {{mockery of}} comic book based <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> perfectly done...Though {{not quite as}} funny as last week’s 'The Ring', 'The Coon' is right up there as a classic episode, ... A beacon of hope in the sometimes drab world of television," [...] {{while at the same}} time, he believed the episode title, [...] "The Coon" [...] (being a well-known ethnic slur against black people) was a jab intended for Barack Obama, the first African American U.S. President.|$|E

500|$|Like other baboons, {{the olive}} baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. In fact, {{along with the}} muzzle, the animal's tail (...) and four-legged gait can make baboons seem very canine. The tail almost {{looks as if it}} is broken, as it is erect for the first quarter, after which it drops down sharply. The bare patch of a baboon's rump, famously seen in {{cartoons}} and <b>movies,</b> <b>is</b> a good deal smaller in the olive baboon. The olive baboon, like most cercopithecines, has a cheek pouch with which to store food.|$|E
500|$|Well, my {{favorite}} scene {{in all of}} Monroe's <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> when she does that dance sequence for 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'. And {{when it came time}} to do the video for the song , I said, I can just redo that whole scene and it will be perfect. [...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and I can relate to that. Her sexuality was something everyone was obsessed with and that I can relate to. And there were certain things about her vulnerability that I'm curious about and attracted to.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, {{when you think about}} it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pinter in 2006, conducted by critic Michael Billington {{as part of the}} cultural programme of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Pinter confirmed that he would continue to write poetry but not plays. [...] In response, the audience shouted No in unison, urging him to keep writing. [...] Along with the international symposium on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, curated by Billington, the 2006 Europe Theatre Prize theatrical events celebrating Pinter included new productions (in French) of Precisely (1983), One for the Road (1984), Mountain Language (1988), The New World Order (1991), Party Time (1991), and Press Conference (2002) (French versions by Jean Pavans); and Pinter Plays, Poetry & Prose, an evening of dramatic readings, directed by Alan Stanford, of the Gate Theatre, Dublin. [...] In June 2006, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) hosted a celebration of Pinter's films curated by his friend, the playwright David Hare. [...] Hare introduced the selection of film clips by saying: [...] "To jump back into the world of Pinter's <b>movies...</b> <b>is</b> to remind yourself of a literate mainstream cinema, focused as much as Bergman's is on the human face, in which tension is maintained by a carefully crafted mix of image and dialogue." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie <b>movies</b> <b>is</b> you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
