40|$|Thesis (MSc (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 High voltage {{transmission}} system availability and system security are key performance criteria for electricity utilities worldwide. System disturbances {{need to be}} cleared quickly and accurately in order to minimise the impact of faults and to facilitate speedy system restoration. In this context, the South African utility, Eskom has maintained a process of refreshing protective relaying technology as older equipment becomes obsolete {{and is no longer}} capable of meeting the utility’s requirements. The difficulties which a process of equipment renewal presents the organisation with include the risk of incorrectly applying the newer technologies within the complex electrical network. The application of new technology is affected by the complexities of the newer technology with respect to the older, more familiar technologies. Some of the difficulties can be addressed with revised commissioning procedures or the use of modern test equipment. Enhanced relay algorithms and settings calculation methodologies can however not be simplified. Protective relay <b>maloperations</b> cannot always be completely avoided and when they do occur, these must be investigated and addressed to prevent future recurrences. The research covered by this dissertation focuses on a number of protective relay <b>maloperations</b> on transmission lines using impedance protection algorithms. The research undertaken identifies the previously unidentified causes of the <b>maloperations</b> and describes a relay settings solution for improving the accuracy of the protective relays. The methodology that was followed in the research covers the following aspects: • Identification and highlighting of some of the protection relay <b>maloperations</b> that occurred during system faults, • Review of the fundamental principles involved in system fault analysis, • Comprehensive study of the theory involved in the calculation of an overhead line conductor self and mutual-inductance, as well as the calculation of the positive, negative and zero sequence impedances of an overhead line, • Brief evaluation of the effect of load impedance on relay measurements and the impact on fault clearing operation, • Analysis of the theoretical operation of various numerical relays during singlephase- to-earth faults in radial and meshed (complex) network conditions, • Mathematical calculations using typical Newton-Raphson methods to study the impact of resistive single-phase-to-earth faults on the voltage and current measurements at the relaying position with the exclusion of the capacitive components between conductors and conductors and earth, • Comparison and evaluation of mathematical calculations and system studies using network simulation software which included all steady state network parameters, • Review and analysis of actual system faults that had been previously analysed without definitive conclusion. The faults were re-analysed in an attempt to correlate findings with the hypothesis of the research, • Comparison of the performance of protective relay impedance charactersitics using positive sequence domain versus loop domain analysis techniques. This study concluded that significant benefits can be achieved by analysing system faults and relay operation using loop quantities in primary impedance values as opposed to positive sequence or apparent impedance quantities in secondary values. The inherent differences between the positive or apparent impedance characteristics of the relays are nullified when considered in the loop impedance domain, provided that the relays reach settings were calculated correctly. The study also showed that load current cannot be ignored when calculating settings as it has significant impact on the actual impedance measured during fault conditions. It is therefore crucial that when relays from different manufacturers are being used to protect the same circuit that the differences between the relays and the subsequent measurements are clearly understood and compensated for. Finally relay setting changes have been proposed for implementation based on the findings of this research. The combination of the theory, network simulations and secondary injections performed on the relays all correlate and therefore validate the research. It is left for the utility and or users of these relays to evaluate the results of this research and implement the necessary changes as applicable. Master...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behaviour}} of a distance relay on a double circuit transmission line is analyzed and simulated using EMTDC/PSCAD software. The {{positive and negative}} sequence couplings between two circuits of a double circuit transmission line are small and negligible. However, the zero sequence coupling is not small. Indeed, if the zero sequence coupling is not compensated in impedance calculations, distance relay may either seriously overreach or underreach under different operational situations. These <b>maloperations</b> become more severe specially in {{the case that the}} two networks connected {{to the ends of the}} protected lines have extraordinary different equivalent impedances. Under these conditions if the zero sequence mutual coupling is not compensated, distance relay operation would not be reliable. However, in the compensated scheme relay performance is acceptably improved and the impedance estimated by the relay is close to the actual value. In this paper, a double circuit transmission line is simulated and operation and setting of line protective distance relay is analyzed by simulation. Mathematical analysis also confirms the results of simulations. The same results are also valid for two transmission lines in close proximity...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{progress}} in renewable energy (RE) technologies {{has led to}} the erection of RE power plants (REPPs) up to the order of several hundred megawatts. Unlike their predecessors, which generally appeared in the form of dispersed generation (DG) coupled mainly with distribution systems, such large REPPs are naturally part of high-voltage transmission networks and hold non-negligible proportions of the generation. On the other hand, RE-based DGs are becoming pervasive in modern distribution systems. As a result, the fault ride-through (FRT) requirement has become an essential part of modern grid codes. This dissertation investigates the challenges brought about by the FRT requirement now affecting protection of systems with which REPPs are integrated. On the transmission level, it explores the performance of distance relays that are installed at an REPP substation and protect the neighboring line. The analyses are founded upon time-domain simulation of detailed REPP models with FRT capability. The studies include squirrel cage induction generator and doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) -based wind farms, as well as full-scale converter-interfaced REPPs. The exclusive fault behavior of REPPs is scrutinized to identify possible relay <b>maloperations</b> and their root causes. The relay malfunctions revealed by this dissertation are restricted to systems with REPPs, and are not among the known distance relay failures that can occur in conventional power systems. If a communication link with minimal bandwidth requirement is in place, distance relays provide non-delayed fast tripping over {{the entire length of the}} line. This feature is retained by devising modified relaying algorithms. On the distribution level, the dissertation examines the effects of RE-based DGs on directional relays and on fault type classification methods. DFIG-based wind turbines constitute an appreciable portion of today's DG power. Conventional directional elements are shown to be adversely affected when a distribution system incorporates DFIG-based wind DG. An effective method is proposed to identify the fault direction using the waveshape properties of fault signals. Microgrids are the building blocks of future smart distribution systems. Protective devices of smart and fault-resilient microgrids are not expected to trip the healthy phases during unbalanced short-circuits. Thus, some utilities as well as relay manufacturers have started contemplating single- and double-pole tripping for distribution systems. Selective phase tripping demands fault type classification. This dissertation reveals that existing industrial methods that exploit the phase difference between sequence currents and the magnitudes of phase and sequence currents misidentify the fault type in microgrids that include photovoltaic and/or Type IV wind DGs. Using phase and sequence voltages, two new classifiers are proposed to determine the fault type for not only microgrids with different DGs, but for any three-phase system. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 45 - 52 The paper {{summarizes}} {{experience of}} the results of check valve operation (and <b>maloperation)</b> over a number of years, concentrating on data gathered during the last three years in an olefine plant. Continuous tape recording is employed, and variables such as speed, pressures, valve position and vibration can be made available for study after a machine trip. Much concern was caused by the discovery of very rapid decelerations in the ethylene and HP process gas compressors. Careful analysis proves that reverse rotation can occur after rapid deceleration, and speeds over 4000 rpm in reverse have been detected. Observed deceleration rates are compared for typical frictional rundowns and process pressure driven rundown, with and without reverse rotation occurring. The physical details are explained by reference to the tape records. Calculation of the process energy levels and machine internals are used to show the magnitude of the driving forces and to establish limits to the processes. The concept of limiting runaway speed in reverse is introduced. Finally, recommendations are made for check valve characteristics and location to minimize the risk of problems due to inefficiency or <b>maloperation...</b>|$|E

When the system is under such stressed condition, the occurrence of a static phenomenon like load encroachment or dynamic phenomena like power swings may result in <b>maloperation</b> of distance relays [1 – 5].

However, balanced measures of security and dependability in a protection system are required for the reliable operation of the power system under any operating conditions [7]. Therefore, developing an adaptive coordinated control of the protection system is a growing need for maintaining security-dependability balance [8, 9]. Emerging synchrophasor measurements based supervised backup protection methodologies can effectively maintain this balance and hence enhances reliability of the power system [10, 11].|$|E
