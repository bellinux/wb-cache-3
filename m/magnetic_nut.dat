We also discover a duality transformation which is the symmetry of the spacetime metric and it leads in a natural manner to a vacuum spacetime dual to the Kerr solution describing the gravitational field of rotating gravo <b>magnetic</b> (<b>NUT)</b> charge.

40|$|Asymptotic {{behaviour}} {{of gravitational}} and electromagnetic fields of exact type D solutions {{from the large}} Plebanski-Demianski family of black hole spacetimes is analyzed. The amplitude and directional structure of radiation is evaluated in cases when the cosmological constant is non-vanishing, so that the conformal infinities have either de Sitter-like or anti-de Sitter-like character. In particular, explicit relations between the parameters that characterize the sources (that is their mass, electric and <b>magnetic</b> charges, <b>NUT</b> parameter, rotational parameter, and acceleration) and properties of the radiation generated by them are presented. The results further elucidate the physical interpretation of these solutions and may help to understand radiative characteristics of more general spacetimes than those that are asymptotically flat.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the structure of extremal stationary spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the STU model of D= 4, N= 2 supergravity in terms of four-qubit systems. Our analysis extends the results of previous investigations based on three qubits. The basic idea facilitating this four-qubit interpretation {{is the fact that}} stationary solutions in D= 4 supergravity can be described by dimensional reduction along the time direction. In this D= 3 picture the global symmetry group SL(2,R) ^× 3 of the model is extended by the Ehlers SL(2,R) accounting for the fourth qubit. We introduce a four qubit state depending on the charges (electric, <b>magnetic</b> and <b>NUT)</b> the moduli and the warp factor. We relate the entanglement properties of this state to different classes of black hole solutions in the STU model. In the terminology of four qubit entanglement extremal black hole solutions correspond to nilpotent, and nonextremal ones to semisimple states. In arriving at this entanglement based scenario the role of the four algebraically independent four qubit SL(2,C) invariants is emphasized. Comment: 47 pages LATE...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the Plebański class of electrovacuum {{solutions to the}} Einstein equations with a cosmological constant. These space-times, which are {{also known as the}} Kerr-Newman-NUT-(anti-) de Sitter space-times, are characterized by a mass m, a spin a, a parameter β that comprises electric and <b>magnetic</b> charge, a <b>NUT</b> parameter ℓ and a cosmological constant Λ. Based on a detailed discussion of the photon regions in these space-times (i. e., of the regions in which spherical lightlike geodesics exist), we derive an analytical formula for the shadow of a Kerr-Newman-NUT-(anti-) de Sitter black hole, for an observer at given Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (r_O, ϑ_O) in the domain of outer communication. We visualize the photon regions and the shadows for various values of the parameters. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

More precisely, under the assumptions {{of the existence of}} two commuting axial isometries and a non-degenerate connected event horizon of the cross section topology S^ 3, or lens space, we prove that a stationary charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole in five-dimensional minimal supergravity is uniquely characterized by its mass, two independent angular momenta, electric charge, <b>magnetic</b> flux and <b>nut</b> charge, provided that there does not exist any nuts in the domain of outer communication. We also show that under the assumptions of the same symmetry, same asymptotics and the horizon cross section of S^ 1 × S^ 2, a black ring within the same theory [...] -if exists [...] -is uniquely determined by its dipole charge and rod structure besides the charges and magnetic flux.

40|$|Abstract The exact {{solution}} for the electromagnetic field occuring when the Kerr-NUT black hole is immersed (i) in an originally uniform magnetic field aligned along the axis of axial symmetry (ii) in dipolar magnetic field generated by current loop has been investigated. Effective potential of motion of charged test particle around slowly rotating Kerr-NUT black hole immersed in magnetic field with different values of external <b>magnetic</b> field and <b>NUT</b> parameter has been also investigated. In both cases presence of <b>NUT</b> parameter and <b>magnetic</b> field shifts stable circular orbits {{in the direction of}} the central gravitating object. Finally we find analytical solutions of Maxwell equations in the external background spacetime of a slowly rotating magnetized NUT star. The star is considered isolated and in vacuum, with monopolar configuration model for the stellar magnetic field.

40|$|We present {{unfolded}} {{description of}} AdS 4 black hole with generic parameters of mass, <b>NUT,</b> <b>magnetic</b> and electric charges {{as well as}} two kinematical parameters one of which is angular momentum. A flow with respect to black hole parameters, that relates the obtained black hole unfolded system to the covariant constancy condition for an AdS 4 global symmetry parameter, is found. The proposed formulation gives rise to a coordinate-independent description of the black hole metric in AdS 4. The black hole charges are identified with flow evolution parameters while its kinematical constants are the first integrals of the black hole unfolded system expressed via invariants of the AdS 4 global symmetry parameter. It is shown how the proposed method reproduces various known forms of black hole metrics including the Carter and Kerr–Newman solutions. Free flow gauge parameters allow us to choose different metric representations such as Kerr–Schild, double Kerr–Schild or generalized Carter–Plebanski in th...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the results}} of arXiv: 0804. 0009, where all timelike supersymmetric {{backgrounds}} of N= 2, D= 4 matter-coupled supergravity with Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging were classified, we construct genuine nut-charged BPS black holes in AdS_ 4 with nonconstant moduli. The calculations are exemplified for the SU(1, 1) /U(1) model with prepotential F=-iX^ 0 X^ 1. The resulting supersymmetric black holes have a hyperbolic horizon and carry two electric, two <b>magnetic</b> and one <b>nut</b> charge, which are however not all independent, but are given in terms of three free parameters. We find that turning on a nut charge lifts the flat directions in the effective black hole potential, such that the horizon values of the scalars are completely fixed by the charges. We also oxidize the solutions to eleven dimensions, and find that they generalize the geometry found in hep-th/ 0105250 corresponding to membranes wrapping holomorphic curves in a Calabi-Yau five-fold. Finally, a class of nut-charged Nernst branes is constructed as well, but these have curvature singularities at the horizon. Comment: 21 pages, no figures, uses JHEP 3. cl...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is about an}} analytic way to describe the shadow of black holes. As introduction, {{a survey of the}} attempts to observe the shadow of the black holes in our Galaxy near Sgr A* and in the neighbouring galaxy M 87 is presented. Black holes are described by metrics of the general Plebanski-Demianski class of space-times. All these metrics are axially symmetric and stationary type D solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant. The space-times are characterized by seven parameters: mass, spin, electric and <b>magnetic</b> charge, gravitomagnetic <b>NUT</b> charge, a so-called acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant. Based on a detailed discussion of the metrics, analytical formulas are derived for the photon regions (regions that contain spherical lightlike geodesics) and for the boundary curve of the shadow as it is seen by an observer at given Boyer-Lindquist coordinates in the domain of outer communication. They make it possible to analyze the dependency of the shadow of a Kerr black hole on the motion of the observer. For all cases, the photon regions and shadows are visualized for various values of the parameters. The analytical formulas are used to find explicit expressions for the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the shadow. Finally, these values are estimated for the black holes at the centers of our Galaxy and of M 87...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper we have {{analytically}} determined the photon regions and {{the shadows of}} black holes of the Plebański class of metrics which are {{also known as the}} Kerr [...] Newman [...] NUT [...] (anti-) deSitter metrics. These metrics are characterized by six parameters: mass, spin, electric and <b>magnetic</b> charge, gravitomagnetic <b>NUT</b> charge, and the cosmological constant. Here we extend this analysis to the Plebański [...] Demiański class of metrics which contains, in addition to these six parameters, the so-called acceleration parameter. All these metrics are axially symmetric and stationary type D solutions to the Einstein [...] Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant. We derive analytical formulas for the photon regions (i. e., for the regions that contain spherical lightlike geodesics) and for the boundary curve of the shadow as it is seen by an observer at Boyer [...] Lindquist coordinates (r_O, ϑ _O) in the domain of outer communication. Whereas all relevant formulas are derived for the whole Plebański [...] Demiański class, we concentrate on the accelerated Kerr metric (i. e., only mass, spin and acceleration parameter are different from zero) when discussing the influence of the acceleration parameter on the photon region and on the shadow in terms of pictures. The accelerated Kerr metric is also known as the rotating C-metric. We discuss how our analytical formulas can be used for calculating the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the shadow and we estimate these values for the black holes at the center of our Galaxy and at the center of M 87.
