5000|$|... 20's Plenty for Us is a {{voluntary}} organisation that campaigns for {{the introduction of}} a default 20 mph speed limit for streets in built up areas. By seeking to obtain implementation across a complete local authority or community then the organisation believes that worthwhile speed reductions can be achieved without the usual physical calming features. It terms this type of intervention as [...] "Total 20". No physical calming is required and the local traffic authority can <b>make</b> exceptions <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> It is based in Warrington, England with self-employed campaign managers in York and London and has local campaign groups throughout the UK and some overseas.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the Cold War and subsequent downsizing, the U. S. Army has struggled with the challenge of recruiting and retaining the highest quality soldiers to ensure future readiness. Each year, the Army plans and executes over 100, 000 permanent change of station assignments for its 345, 000 enlisted soldiers. The inherently complex challenge of assignment planning consists of balancing Army requirements and readiness with soldiers' professional needs and personal preferences. The Army's centralized and hierarchical assignment process could be improved using proven information technologies. Specifically, the process could be made more efficient using web- based markets and intelligent agents to more effectively plan and assign soldiers to billets. This thesis evaluates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the Army's assignment process and its outcomes, compares and contrasts it with the Navy's assignment process, estimates and evaluates the utility of one- and two- sided matching processes using a computer simulation, and <b>makes</b> recommendations, <b>where</b> <b>appropriate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Patient {{and public}} {{criticism}} of care in many South African public hospitals {{has resulted in}} negative media reports. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the effect of appointing Quality Assurance Nurse Managers (QANMs) on the provision of quality patient care in selected public hospitals of the Limpopo Province and to <b>make</b> recommendations <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The study was quantitative, exploratory and descriptive in nature. Data was collected by means of a self-developed questionnaire from 112 respondents, consisting of 10 QANMs and 102 Quality Assurance Team members (QAT). The response rate was 100 % for the QANMs and 57 % for the QAT members. The study found that most of the ten selected hospitals have a good QA foundation with a vision, mission and goals, QA programme and manual. Moreover, the appointment of the QANMs had a positive impact on the nursing care. Regarding the improvement and change in the provision of nursing care, the majority of the respondents indicated that patients’ complaints about nursing care had declined considerably; the in-service training assisted in improving nursing care, and patients were nursed in totality because of the quality guidelines in the QA manuals. However, the study found that the shortage of equipment, which interferes with the delivery of quality patient care, is a serious problem that hinders the QA programme and needs to be tackled. Recommendations were made for practice and further research. Health Studie...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{the spring of}} 1999, The Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary all entered the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These were the first former Warsaw Pact members to gain NATO accession since the Cold War ended with the dismemberment of the Soviet Union and {{the disintegration of the}} Warsaw Pact between 1989 and 1991. Now, seven more states are near the end of their accession talks. Barring unforeseen events, all are expected to join the alliance in 2004. This thesis studies the 1999 round of NATO accessants, particularly in the short time period since they achieved membership, and garners lessons for the new round of NATO candidates. It notes other significant events that led to NATO's enlargement, including NATO's post-Cold War transformation and the war in the Balkans along with courageous leadership. The thesis summarizes common themes, identifies differences, and suggests solutions that could be implemented for the next round of NATO entrants, as well as for NATO as a whole, based on the three cases studied. It <b>makes</b> policy recommendations <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Lieutenant Colonel, Colorado Air National Guar...|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} in 1977 by the Four State Indian Health Board, Aberdeen, South Dakota for the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service. The first phase evaluated IHS {{health care delivery}} to Indian people in the Aberdeen area, and accomplished three general objectives: 1) described the contract health care situation for Indian people in the Aberdeen Area; 2) discussed four possible alternatives for improving Indian health care delivery; and 3) made projections of the additional data and analysis required for choosing among these alternatives. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide information to permit conclusions to be formed about the quality of medical care received by Indian people and to <b>make</b> recommendations, <b>where</b> <b>appropriate,</b> with the aim of insuring the adequacy of that care. The study uses both qualitative and quantitative data. Data has been collected and categorized, from records, and results produced in table form. There is an extensive narrative description of the procedures used. Fourteen Tribes/health organizations have submitted either a resolution or a letter of supporting one of the health care alternatives. The large majority of these support Alternative 4 [...] a major Medical Referral Center. Data demonstrates a well-defined need for improved health services for the Indian people of the Aberdeen Area. The Indian people know that necessary measures must be taken, and they have made the following suggestions: 1) an evaluation project be continued into Phase III; 2) steps be taken to bring the health status of the Indian people in the Aberdeen Area to a level comparable to that enjoyed by the general population; 3) a Major Medical Referral Center be established in the Aberdeen Area; 4) a Major Medical Referral Center be a separate appropriation and that funding for the present Service Units or funding for contract care monies not be cut; 5) the location for the Medical Center be determined in accordance with Tribal preferences; 6) the provision for transportation be allowed; 7) the Major Medical Center be fully staffed; and 8) cultural values be considered...|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that health-related {{quality of life}} is impaired in people with chronic hepatitis C whereas little is known about similar effects of chronic hepatitis B. A study was conducted to explore differences in HRQoL (including perceived stigma) between CHB and CHC participants. As expected, CHB participants scored substantially lower on perceived stigma. However, {{there was no difference in}} HRQoL between the two groups, indicating that other factors must impact negatively on people with CHB. The current research aims to reduce unrecognized and untreated cases of CHB. Two priority populations and several priority action areas in the First National Hepatitis B Strategy are being addressed. Migrant populations from endemic areas represent the majority of people with CHB in Australia. Studies in the U. S. show that Hmong people are worse affected than most. Therefore, the Hmong community living in Cairns area (Far North Queensland) will likely benefit from -and has expressed interest in participating in this research. Routine antenatal screening offers great opportunities for increasing awareness about CHB, especially in people at increased risk. However, follow-up care for women who test positive during pregnancy is often neglected, partly due to a lack of CHB knowledge and awareness in primary health care providers. Phase 1 of this project aims to assess current hepatitis B awareness and antenatal practice in order to identify gaps and barriers. This includes CHB-related information currently provided to pregnant women; barriers preventing health-seeking behaviours; and to what extent and through whom contact tracing (screening/immunization/monitoring) occurs. Considering that the majority of people with CHB were infected at birth or during early childhood, it is important to not only trace household contacts but also parents and siblings living elsewhere. The objectives for Phase 1 are to survey local GPs, a high risk population (using psychosocial constructs based on behavioural theory), and new/expectant mothers from the general population, and to <b>make</b> comparisons <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The results will form the basis for the development and evaluation of suitable interventions in Phase 11. This presentation will cover the work that has been done so far...|$|R
