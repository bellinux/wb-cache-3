2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the <b>multiple</b> <b>switchboard,</b> could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final selector performed a sleeve test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|E
5000|$|Early switchboards {{in large}} cities usually were mounted floor to ceiling {{in order to allow}} the {{operators}} to reach all the lines in the exchange. The operators were boys who would use a ladder to connect to the higher jacks. Late in the 1890s this measure failed {{to keep up with the}} increasing number of lines, and Milo G. Kellogg devised the Divided <b>Multiple</b> <b>Switchboard</b> for operators to work together, with a team on the [...] "A board" [...] and another on the [...] "B." [...] These operators were almost always women until the early 1970s, when men were once again hired. Cord switchboards were often referred to as [...] "cordboards" [...] by telephone company personnel. Conversion to Panel switch and other automated switching systems first eliminated the [...] "B" [...] operator and then, usually years later, the [...] "A". Rural and suburban switchboards for the most part remained small and simple. In many cases, customers came to know their operator by name.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1880s, Kellogg {{had been}} a manager at Western Electric (he was {{superintendent}} of Western Electric's Chicago manufacturing and research plant) and the Southern Telephone and Telegraph Company. In 1897, with [...] expiring, Kellogg set up his own manufacturing firm, Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company. Kellogg himself held more than 150 patents, and he had invented and patented the Divided <b>Multiple</b> telephone <b>switchboard.</b> The new company manufactured the equipment as its flagship product. This switchboard offered greater flexibility and efficiency than earlier designs in handling large numbers of telephone subscribers at each urban exchange. Kellogg Switchboard & Supply primarily supplied local independent telephone companies.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} telephone {{services were}} installed as {{point to point}} systems. That is from a telephone in one premise of a company to a second telephone in a separate property. The idea of linking <b>multiple</b> telephones via <b>switchboards</b> to become a network was to come later. One such isolated private system was the first use of telephones in Bathurst. The following article in the local newspaper reports of the first telephone.|$|R
