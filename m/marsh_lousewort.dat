50|$|Bog-bean, {{grass of}} Parnassus' western <b>marsh</b> orchid and <b>lousewort</b> {{are found in}} the wet meadows and low marshes; and the {{extremely}} rare large brown clover, hairy stonecrop and Pyrenean scurvygrass in the springwater marshes of the Hohe Rhön.|$|R
5000|$|The Dommelbeemden. This divers area is {{designated}} as a natural monument in 1977. There are wet meadows in which rare plants such as <b>Marsh</b> <b>Lousewort</b> can be found. There is a hiking path and a watchtower has been built.|$|E
50|$|At {{the base}} of the valley slopes there are boggy areas with common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), common {{bilberry}} (Vaccinium myrtillus), <b>marsh</b> <b>lousewort</b> (Pedicularis palustris), and many-stalked spike-rush (Eleocharis multicaulis). The wet pasture supports uncommon species such as whorled caraway (Carum verticillatum), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), and heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. ericetorum).|$|E
50|$|The wetland {{contains}} {{a collection of}} marshland plants. County rarities such as bog pimpernel are recorded, together with <b>marsh</b> <b>lousewort,</b> common cotton-grass, skull-cap, ragged-robin and southern marsh-orchid. Many sedges may be found. These include the only recorded Gloucestershire population of dioecious sedge. A particular feature of the marsh is tussock-sedge, with about forty different flowering plants living as epiphytes on the 2-3 ft high tussocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep slopes}} at Tissø's {{northern}} end {{is also to}} be protected. Here sunloving plants like small pasque flower, sunrose and dwarf everlast are found, with the rare and threatened fragrant scabious in between. The meadows below the cliffs are also of botanical interest, supporting plants like <b>marsh</b> <b>lousewort,</b> bog-star and various true sedges like blue sedge along with orchids like early marsh orchid, western marsh orchid and marsh helleborine, in a biotope of calcium-rich springs.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet {{is located}} on the B6270 between Thwaite and Keld below Great Shunner Fell and close to a small beck named Skeb Skeugh. The area around this beck, known as Angram Bottoms, has been {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is made of seven fields covering 24.2 acres supporting a diverse habitat of flora. A combination of mire and wet grassland, due to many sinkholes and springs. Plants in the wet grasslands that can be found here include sharp-flowered rush, lesser spearwort, slender tufted-sedge, bottle sedge, common marsh-bedstraw, northern marsh-orchid, marsh-marigold and meadowsweet. Other areas of marsh support <b>marsh</b> <b>lousewort,</b> carnation sedge, flea sedge, star sedge, marsh valerian and marsh violet.|$|E
5000|$|The Dommelbeemden {{consist of}} species-poor meadows with willows and include rattles and orchids. There are wet meadows in which rare {{plants such as}} <b>Marsh</b> <b>Lousewort</b> can be found. A {{clogging}} old meander of the Dommel there is filled with water lilies. At a higher elevation, {{which is part of}} the Central Brabant Sand Ridge, there are traditional [...] "bolakkers" [...] (high fields). The meadows are the low-lying grasslands directly along the Dommel. Through regular flooding these grounds were once only suitable as a hayfield. This hay was important because it served as winter feed for livestock. Originally, this landscape was interspersed with carrs and coppice hedges. On the upper parts of the river valley, there are bolakkers (high fields) where mainly cereals were cultivated. The area is known to have rare plants and animals.|$|E
5000|$|The Račna Karst Field {{has several}} habitats, {{some of which}} are {{significant}} at the European level. The land is predominantly grassland, with patches of woods and brush here and there. Brush is especially present along the river channels, along with areas covered in sedge or rushes. Spring flowers include the bog violet (Viola uliginosa), snake's head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum), spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza spp.), and marsh orchid (Orchis palustris). Specimens of <b>marsh</b> <b>lousewort</b> (Pedicularis palustris) and march gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe) are still present but in decline, and due to fertilizer use the oblong-leaved sundew (Drosera intermedia) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) have disappeared in the last decade. The area is also a habitat for the swamp cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), and in some drier areas there are also less hygrophilous plants.|$|E
