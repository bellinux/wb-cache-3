50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> levers were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|E
50|$|Power {{interlockings}} {{may also}} use <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> {{to ensure the}} proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the locking bed, contacts on the levers actuate the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, an indication must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power interlocking machine.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{inexpensive}} safes sold to households for under $100 use <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms that {{are vulnerable to}} bouncing. Many cheap safes use a magnetic locking pin to prevent lateral movement of an internal locking bolt, and use a solenoid to move the pin when the correct code is entered. This pin can also be moved by {{the impact of the}} safe being dropped or struck while on its side, which allows the safe to be opened. One security researcher taught his three-year-old son how to open most consumer gun safes. More expensive safes use a gear mechanism that is less susceptible to mechanical attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic locks {{as well as}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> are {{available}} on many models of safes. The highest reliability exists for <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks,</b> although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic <b>locks.</b> [...] Some <b>mechanical</b> combination <b>locks</b> have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations {{in the hopes of}} unlocking the safe.|$|R

50|$|Automatic Systems {{has been}} the first company to use the {{principle}} of the crankshaft rod (movement transmission by crankshaft-rod) in the development and manufacturing of automatic barriers and gates. This system, already in use in numerous applications, has become a reference in access control equipment for many years ahead. The advantages of a movement by crankshaft-rod are twofold: it allows a perfect <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> of the boom in both end positions (open and close), thus peventing any external influence (e.g. attempt to raise the boom...); it ensures a smooth speed acceleration of the boom till 45° and a speed deceleration up to 90° avoiding shocks at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement (see below sample of mechanism with crankshaft - rod device.|$|E

50|$|If {{performed}} improperly, bedding {{can destroy}} a rifle. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> occurs when bedding material {{is allowed to}} harden in holes or around protrusions on the action. If locking occurs, the action can be permanently fixed to the stock. Extreme measures {{may have to be}} taken to separate the stock from the action, possibly destroying one or both. Locking can be prevented by carefully filling all holes and crevices in the action with clay and removing or taping any protrusions on the action. Never apply bedding material on the upper half of the action or anything that is wider at the bottom than the top. Improperly applied or insufficient release agent can cause the bedding material to bind to the metal. If the trigger assembly is not removed prior to bedding, epoxy can seep into the trigger assembly and ruin it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> security {{from the}} perspective of computer science and cryptology. We focus on new and practical attacks for amplifying rights in <b>mechanical</b> pin tumbler <b>locks.</b> Given access to a single master-keyed lock and its associated key, a procedure is given that allows discovery and creation of a working master key for the system. No special skill or equipment, beyond a small number of blank keys and a metal file, is required, and the attacker need engage in no suspicious behavior at the lock’s location. Countermeasures are also described that may provide limited protection under certain circumstances. We conclude with directions for research in this area and the suggestion that <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> are worthy objects for study and scrutiny. ...|$|R
50|$|The prototype, EF63 1, was {{produced}} in 1962 by Toshiba for testing before full production of the class started in 1963 spread between manufacturers Kawasaki, Mitsubishi and Toshiba. The class was equipped {{with a number of}} special safety features to cope with the unique conditions of operating on the 66.7‰ gradient of the Usui Pass. These included independent dynamic brakes on all six axles (hence the large louvres along the bodysides for heat dissipation), magnetic adhesion brakes operating directly on the rails, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> brakes. Small wheels attached to the centre bogie were used to measure the train speed and apply the brakes in the case of run-away. The class used the same 425 kW MT52 traction motors used on the EF62s and also the EF70s.The entire class was based at Yokokawa depot, and they were always used in pairs at the Yokokawa end of trains travelling in both directions, and were capable of operating in multiple with Class EF62 locomotives and a wide range of EMU types (including 115, 185, 189, 489 series) - hence the impressive array of jumper cables and connectors on the Karuizawa ends of the locos. Trains ascending the incline from Yokokawa were driven by the driver in the rearmost cab of the EF63 pair {{at the rear of the}} train, with the driver in the front cab of the train acting only as signal look-out.|$|E

40|$|Following {{testing methods}} have been {{compared}} and their response assessed to parameter changes {{in the process of}} plasma spraying and substrate pretreatment: Pull-off-test, hardness-indentation-test, shear test, and fracture mechanics by 4 -point-bend test and double- torsion-test. Different effects on the adhesion properties like <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking,</b> physical bonding forces, residual stress enter the test results in a different way. Thus the results prove, that the shear test is revealing the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> of coating material with the roughened substrate surface better, while the interfacial hardness indentation test is more sensitive to the physical bonding forces between coating and substrate. Between those two methods the pull-off test takes an intermediate position.
