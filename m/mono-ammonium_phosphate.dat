40|$|Phosphate Hill is a {{mine site}} located in North West Queensland. At the site, mined phosphoric rock is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is {{combined}} with ammonia in a reactor known as the pre-neutraliser. The reaction forms a very hot and viscous slurry which is later further ammoniated in a cylindrical vessel known as a granulator, to produce solid fertiliser granules of <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) or di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). Two important parameters used in the processing of ammonium phosphate slurries are the nitrogen to phosphorous mole ratio (MR) and the specific gravity (SG). Both of these parameters can affect the rheology of the slurry produced inside the reactor. The impurities carried over in the phosphoric acid from the reaction with the phosphate rock can also have significant effects on the rheology of the slurry. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the rheological characteristics of the ammonium phosphate slurries formed in the pre-neutraliser (PN) and determine how the viscosity changes with mole ratio, impurity composition and specific gravity. There is a lot of variability in the literature on the rheology of ammonium phosphate slurries. Previous work did not take into account the non-Newtonian nature of the slurry, whilst also basing their findings on plant based measurements, where proper control of the slurry properties would have been difficult. A bulk quantity of phosphoric acid was collected from Phosphate Hill and used as a baseline for testing the effect of adding impurities. Laboratory grade FePO 4, AlPO 4 and Mg 3 (PO 4) 2 were added to the plant acid to form acids of varying impurity content. Further to the viscosity experiments, work was conducted to determine the slurry particle size, chemical composition (by XRD/XRF analysis), solubility of precipitates and physical characteristics, in an attempt to explain the mechanisms behind the observed viscosity changes. Testing the viscosity of ammonium phosphate slurry was found to be very time consuming and problematic. The experimental work was complicated by a multitude of factors, including high temperatures, slow reaction and evaporation times, the precipitation of impurities and the solidification of the slurry. The trend in the viscosity with mole ratio for the as-received acid was similar to that seen in the literature. The addition of both aluminium and iron caused an increase in the viscosity around the MAP minimum solubility point of 0. 9 MR. In both cases, the formation of hydrolysis products were shown to have reduced the particle size of the precipitating ammonium phosphate crystals, thus increasing the viscosity. As the mole ratio is increased, <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> combines with the additional ammonia to form di-ammonium phosphate. The hydrolysis products for iron also changed at the same time and the resultant slurry formed particles with high interparticle attractive forces which in turn formed a flocculated suspension. Increasing the iron content not only increased the viscosity in this region, but also lowered the mole ratio whereby the increase in viscosity is seen to occur. An increase in the aluminium content had no effect on the viscosity at higher mole ratios. Based on the findings, it is recommended that slurries containing high iron be preferentially processed to make <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and slurries with high aluminium be preferentially processed to make di-ammonium phosphate. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was conducted on the mixing dynamics of the PN vessel. The CFD model showed that the upper region of the vessel was the least well mixed. The potential for stagnation of the flow field and subsequent solidification increases when the viscosity of the slurry also increases. To counteract this threat, the volume of slurry in the reactor must be decreased, or the agitation speed increased. The most effective method to ensure proper mixing dynamics in the vessel was to lower the viscosity, by preferentially processing each slurry by its impurity content as mentioned above...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{behavior}} of organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) transport including membrane fouling was assessed in fertilizer-drawn forward osmosis (FDFO) during treatment of the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluent. The flux decline was negligible when the FO membrane was oriented with active layer facing feed solution (AL-FS) while severe flux decline was observed with active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) with di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer as DS due to struvite scaling inside the membrane support layer. DAP DS however exhibited the lowest OMPs forward flux or higher OMPs rejection rate compared to other two fertilizers (i. e., <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) and KCl). MAP and KCl fertilizer DS had higher water fluxes that induced higher external concentration polarization (ECP) and enhanced OMPs flux through the FO membrane. Under the AL-DS mode of membrane orientation, OMPs transport was further increased with MAP and KCl as DS due to enhanced concentrative internal concentration polarization while with DAP the internal scaling enhanced mass transfer resistance thereby lowering OMPs flux. Physical or hydraulic cleaning could successfully recover water flux for FO membranes operated under the AL-FS mode but only partial flux recovery was observed for membranes operated under AL-DS mode because of internal scaling and fouling in the support layer.

Boron phosphate compounds were synthesized by mixing boric acid (H 3 BO 3) and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) and heating at temperatures of 25 to 1000 °C for 1 or 24 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and chemical analysis confirmed the formation of BPO 4. The crystallinity of these compounds increased with increasing temperature and heating time. The compounds synthesized at 300 °C or less were hygroscopic and clumped together, while those synthesized at 500 to 1000 °C were non-hygroscopic and free-flowing. The solubility of these compounds was assessed at different pH and P concentrations, and compared to the solubility of ulexite and colemanite. The solubility of the BPO 4 compounds decreased with increasing synthesis temperature and with decreasing pH. The solubility and the kinetics of B release from BPO 4 compounds synthesized at 500 and 800 °C were slower than for most commonly used B sources. Given their slow dissolution, the BPO 4 compounds may have potential to continuously supply B to crops in environments where B leaching is a problem.

In the present study, we investigated the impact of <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) and phosphoric acid on soil pH and chemical transformation of Cd in calcareous soils. Calcareous soils collected from south-west China were treated with three concentrations (0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 molkg(- 1) soil) of MAP and phosphoric acid, and without the addition of acidifying agent, before being incubated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C near field capacity moisture content for 60 days. The chemical forms of Cd in the soils were determined by the Tessier sequential extraction scheme. The concentration of Cd in the form bound to iron and manganese oxides (CdFeOx+MnOy) decreased significantly with increasing levels of the two acidifying agents, but the concentration of exchangeable Cd (Cd-Ex) exhibited a significant increase, indicating that the two acidifying agents can effectively promote the transformation of CdFeOx+MnOy to Cd-Ex. MAP may promote the same amount of CdFeOx+MnOy to Cd-Ex as phosphoric acid at the same rate of addition, but the soil pH clearly differed, implying that an increase in water-soluble P with addition of acidifying agent may be one major factor affecting the chemical transformation of Cd.

40|$|Concern over excess {{phosphorus}} (P) {{input and}} loading in some soils of the Canadian prairie region {{has led to}} a need for {{a better understanding of the}} fate of added manure and fertilizer P. Information on the effects of manure application over long term (i. e., years) and short term (i. e., weeks, months) as related to management practices and manure form is still lacking. Knowledge of the P forms and species present in soil following application of manure and inorganic P fertilizers, and linking this to potential P availability and mobility is needed to make sound P management recommendations. The objective of this thesis project was to assess the speciation of soil P in different manures and inorganic fertilizer-amended Saskatchewan soils as affected by time, presence and absence of plants, landscape position, soil type, and management practices including rate and placement. Three studies were conducted (growth chamber and field-based experiments) to study P behavior in soils. These studies closely followed a time scale, beginning with speciation and fate followed over the very short-term (i. e., days to weeks) to a short-term period (i. e., months to a year) following amendment application, and finally the effects of repeated annual manure additions made over the long term (i. e., 11 years). Soils used in this study were loamy textured Brown and Black Chernozems. Solid cattle manure (SCM) and liquid hog manure (LHM) were applied at low and high rates in the very short-term and long-term studies. The low rate of SCM and LHM application was 7. 6 T ha- 1 yr- 1 (dry weight) and 37, 000 L ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively which was equivalent to approximately 100 kg total N ha- 1 yr- 1 application (agronomic N rate). The high rate was four times this amount. Inorganic fertilizer (<b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> blended with urea) at rate of 54 kg N ha- 1 and 12 kg P ha- 1 and SCM at rate of 60 T ha- 1 were applied in the short-term study. A sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to fractionate P in very short-term and short-term studies and different soil test phosphorus (STP) methods were used to determine effects on the labile P in the long-term study. Changes in P speciation with time and their relative proportions in fertilizered soils were also assessed using the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy in all studies. This study has revealed that manure, especially SCM elevates labile P over all time frames examined. Over the very short-term (i. e., weeks to a month), P was added as manure tends to remain in labile forms like brushite and adsorbed P that is accessible to plants for uptake. In the manure band (months to a year), manure P was relatively unchanged over a period of months while in the <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) fertilizer band, adsorbed and Ca-P was readily formed from fertilizer P. Aging over several years (one to eleven years), along with high soil pH and high Ca:P ratio enhanced formation of more stable Ca-P minerals like apatite, especially in SCM amended soil. Overall, the unique combined use of wet chemical analysis and synchrotron-based techniques in this thesis research has improved our understanding of fate and transformation of P added to prairie soils. It is suggested that future studies of fate of applied P in soil also utilize a combination of wet chemical and spectroscopic techniques, as this was shown to be a rewarding approach...|$|E
40|$|First online: 25 February 2015 Background and aims: Soluble boron (B) sources pose {{a risk of}} B {{toxicity}} to seedlings {{just after}} planting and leaching losses after application and before plant uptake. Boron phosphate (BPO 4) has low water solubility and slowly releases B, and hence could be safe for seedlings. Therefore, we investigated the toxicity of several B sources co-granulated with <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) or co-compacted with potassium chloride referred to as muriate of potash (MOP) on canola seedlings. Methods: Ulexite, borax, colemanite and BPO 4 compounds synthesized at 500 or 800 °C for 1 h were co-granulated with MAP or co-compacted with MOP at inclusion rates of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 % B. The seedling toxicity of these products was evaluated by placing a fertilizer granule in the centre of a soil-filled Petri dish in which canola was seeded. The area of the non-vegetated zone around the granule application site was evaluated after 7 and 12 days of growth. Results: Application of ulexite, borax and colemanite co-granulated with MAP resulted in toxicity symptoms at the lowest concentration of 0. 5 % B, and {{the area of the}} affected zone increased with increasing concentrations of B in the granule, whereas no toxicity symptoms were observed with the application of co-granulated BPO 4 products even at 2. 0 % B content. Similar results were observed for the MOP fertilizers, except for colemanite which showed no toxicity when combined with MOP. Hot water-soluble B concentrations were measured in concentric sections around the granule application site and were in agreement with the toxicity results, with concentration in the toxic range close to the granule for the most soluble B sources.

40|$|A {{population}} balance model is developed {{to describe the}} drum granulation of feeds with a broad size distribution (e. g. recycled fertiliser granules). Granule growth by coalescence is modelled with a sequential two-stage kernel. The first stage of granulation falls within a non-inertial regime as defined by Ennis et al. (Powder Technol., 65 (1991) 257 - 272), with growth occurring by random coalescence. The size distribution is observed to narrow and quickly reach an equilibrium size distribution. Further growth then occurs within a second inertial stage of granulation in which the granule size distribution broadens and requires a size-dependent kernel. This stage is much slower and granule deformation is important. Non-linear regression is used to fit the model to the experimental data of Adetayo et al. (Chem Eng. Sci., 48 (1993) 3951 - 3961) for granulation of ammonium sulfate, <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and di-ammonium phosphate {{for a range of}} moisture contents, granulation times and initial size distributions. The model accurately describes the shape of the granule size distributions over the full range of data. The extent of granulation occurring within the first stage is given by kt; the extent of growth kt is proportional to the fractional liquid saturation of the granule, S, and increases with binder viscosity. Here, k represents the rate constant for the first stage of growth and t represents the time required to reach the final equilibrium size distribution for the first stage. Changes to the initial size distribution affect kt by changing granule porosity and, therefore, liquid saturation. A critical saturation, S, is necessary for the second stage of granulation to occur, leading to further growth. For S≤S, a final equilibrium size distribution is reached before 5 min of granulation time. For S>S, granules are sufficiently deformable to continue growing for up to 25 min. S decreases with increasing binder viscosity. This model is suitable for use in dynamic simulation of granulation circuits where both moisture content and recycle size distribution may vary significantly with time...|$|E

Nitrogen, phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) rates were balanced across treatments (40 kg/ha P, 22 kg/ha S) and fertilizers were broadcast and incorporated immediately prior to planting. Treatment and location main effects were significant (P< 0. 001) on corn yields, whereas the interaction treatment x location was not (P= 0. 33). Maize responded positively to Zn fertilization; average yields across locations increased from 10, 540 kg ha- 1 without Zn to 11, 530 kg ha- 1 with 11. 21 kg Zn ha- 1 applied as a physical blend. The yield response and Zn agronomic efficiency of maize with the application of the complex fertilizer at a rate of 2. 24 kg Zn ha- 1 averaged 1004 kg ha- 1 and 448 kg maize kg Zn- 1, respectively, significantly higher (P< 0. 1) than the yield response and Zn agronomic efficiency with the application of a physical blend with the same Zn rate which averaged 293 kg ha- 1 and 131 kg maize kg Zn- 1, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{has made}} two {{significant}} contributions {{to the field of}} reactive crystallisation. First, new data from batch cooling crystallisation and semi-batch reactive crystallisation experiments of <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) were obtained to describe the key factors that influence crystal nucleation and growth rates, crystal size distribution (CSD), and crystal shape. The second contribution is the development of a numerical scheme for solving the population balance equations, which can be used to describe the evolution of CSD during the crystallisation process. This scheme combines the finite difference method with a wavelet method, and is the first reported application of this approach for crystallisation modelling and simulation. Experiments into the batch cooling crystallisation of MAP were conducted both with and without seed crystals. The effects of key factors such as cooling rate, initial level of supersaturation and seeding technique, including seed concentration and seed size, on the real time supersaturation, final CSD, crystal yield and crystal shape were investigated. It was found that a seed concentration of 20 - 30 % effectively suppressed nucleation. The growth and nucleation rate were estimated by using an isothermal seeded batch approach and their parameters were calculated by non-linear optimisation techniques. The second series of experiments involved the semi-batch reactive crystallisation of MAP. Both single-feed and dual-feed systems were investigated. In the single-feed arrangement, an ammonia solution was fed into a charge of phosphoric acid. In the dual-feed system, phosphoric acid and ammonia solution were fed into a charge of saturated MAP solution. The molar ratio of the reactants, initial supersaturation, presence or absence of seed crystals, initial MAP concentration, reactants’ flow rate, feeding time and stirring speed were varied, and the effects upon the real time supersaturation, final CSD, crystal yield, crystal shape and solution temperature were measured. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that MAP can be produced in both the single-feed and dual-feed arrangements. For the single feed system, the N/P mole ratio controlled the degree of reaction and the CSD of the product. Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was not be observed in the single-feed system due to its high solubility. In the dual-feed system, a seeded solution with slow feed addition, moderate stirring speed and a low initial supersaturation provided the most favourable conditions for generating a desirable supersaturation profile, and thus obtaining a product with good CSD and crystal shape. A comparative numerical study was undertaken in order to evaluate the existing numerical schemes for solving the population balance equations (PBE) that describe crystallisation. Several analytical solutions to the PBE were used to benchmark the following numerical schemes: Upwind Finite Difference, Biased Upwind Finite Difference, Orthogonal Collocation with Finite Elements, and Wavelet Orthogonal Collocation. The Wavelet Finite Difference (WFD) method has been applied {{here for the first time}} for solving PBE problems. The WFD scheme was adapted to solve the batch cooling and the semi-batch reactive crystallisation models, and the solutions were validated against experimental data that we obtained. In summary, the experimental data provide an improved understanding of MAPreaction and crystallisation mechanisms. The adaptability of the WFD method has beendemonstrated validating the two crystallisation systems, and this should help extendthe application of wavelet-based solutions beyond crystallisation processes and intomore diverse areas of chemical engineering...|$|E
40|$|Boron (B) {{deficiency}} and/or toxicity {{have caused}} significant impacts on agricultural crop production worldwide. The {{most commonly used}} sources of fertilizer B are water soluble, and are therefore susceptible to leaching in high rainfall environments. This may result in insufficient supply of B for plant growth later in the crop growth cycle (e. g. flowering), when B supply is most needed. Moreover, these highly soluble sources pose {{an increased risk of}} B toxicity to seedlings just after planting. One possible way to reduce nutrient losses and avoid seedling toxicity is by using slow-release fertilizer. Slow-release fertilizers provide an effective means to overcome the low use-efficiency and problems associated with highly soluble fertilizers in soils prone to nutrient leaching. This study has identified boron phosphate (BPO₄) compounds as potential raw materials for incorporation into macronutrient fertilizers to produce compound fertilizers containing slow-release B. The BPO₄ compounds were found to differ significantly from most commercially available B sources in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics. Boron phosphate compounds synthesized at 500 and 800 °C had low water solubility, with solubility decreasing with decreasing pH, slow kinetics of B release and B concentrations released initially from this B source by water were below the toxicity level for most crops. Products synthesized at these two temperatures were free flowing and were readily incorporated into granular <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) granules. The solubility of other slow-release B sources, namely ulexite and colemanite, were enhanced when co-granulated with MAP due to the low pH and high P concentrations in this macronutrient fertilizer – they therefore lost their slow release characteristics when co-granulated with MAP. This limitation did not apply to BPO₄ compounds where low pH and high P concentrations did not affect, or even slowed, B release. A rapid method to screen fertilizers for possible adverse effects of high B concentrations on germinating seedlings was developed, by assessing canola (Brassica napus L.) germination in Petri dishes using image analysis. The MAP fertilizers co-granulated with ulexite, borax and colemanite had an adverse effect on emerging canola seedlings even at a low total B concentration in the product (0. 5 % B). On the other hand, no toxicity symptoms were observed with the application of MAP co-granulated with BPO₄ even at higher B concentrations in the fertilizer (2. 0 % B). Concentrations of hot-water soluble B measured around the granule application site were in agreement with the toxicity results, with concentrations in the toxic range close to the granule for the most soluble B sources. In plant uptake experiments examining the recovery of B by plants from the various slow-release formulations by two crops of canola, the application of co-granulated soluble B sources led to toxicity in the first crop and deficiency in the second crop. The canola shoot dry weight was increased in treatments using co-granulated BPO₄ products compared with the unfertilized control for both crops. This result suggested that a single application of a macronutrient fertilizer containing co-granulated BPO₄ would be an effective slow-release B fertilizer for several cropping cycles. In summary, co-granulated BPO₄ products have potential as sources of slow-release B for incorporation into macronutrient fertilizers designed for high rainfall environments. This research work could have important implications for future B fertilizer development. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 201...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de estudar, por meio de dois modelos matemáticos, o metabolismo do cálcio (Ca) em ovinos recebendo dietas suplementadas com diferentes fontes de Ca. Foram utilizados 20 cordeiros mestiços Santa Inês (6 a 8 meses de idade) alimentados com uma dieta basal composta de milho, farelo de soja, bagaço de cana hidrolisado, uréia, fosfato monoamônio (MAP) e mistura mineral suplementada com cinco fontes de cálcio: polpa cítrica (PC), feno de alfafa (FA), calcário calcítico (CC), farinha de conchas de ostras (FC) e fosfato bicálcico (FB). Os animais receberam, via jugular, solução contendo 7, 7 MBq de 45 Ca. Durante sete dias, realizaram-se coletas de fezes, sangue e urina. Após o período de coleta, os animais foram sacrificados para retirada de amostras de tecidos (fígado, rins, coração, músculo e 12 ª costela) para análises. O metabolismo de Ca foi avaliado pelos modelos de Vitti et al. (2000) e Fernandez (1995). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado e as médias foram comparadas pelo teste Duncan. Não houve diferença significativa para o consumo de Ca entre os tratamentos. A excreção fecal foi menor para o CC. O balanço de Ca foi negativo para FA e PC. A absorção de Ca pode ter sido prejudicada pela presença de pectina e oxalato na polpa cítrica e no feno de alfafa, respectivamente. Os fluxos entre o compartimento central e o trato digestivo indicaram maior absorção de Ca para o CC. As fontes CC, FB e FC apresentaram maior disponibilidade cálcio, com valores respectivos de 65, 38; 34, 12 e 32, 43 %. A comparação entre os modelos comprovou diferenças nos fluxos entre o sangue e os tecidos e ossos, todavia, o balanço entre esses compartimentos foi similar. As diferenças entre os modelos possivelmente foram ocasionadas pela sua estrutura. This {{research was}} conducted to compare the accuracy of two mathematical models to predict calcium (Ca) metabolism in sheep supplemented with different Ca sources. Twenty Brazilian male sheep averaging 7 to 8 months of age were fed a basal diet containing corn, soybean meal, hydrolyzed sugarcane bagasse, urea, <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> mineral mixture {{and one of the}} following Ca sources: limestone (LM), alfalfa hay (AH), dicalcium phosphate (DP), oyster shell meal (SM), and citrus pulp (CP). On day 22 each animal received an intravenous injection of 7. 7 MBq of radio-calcium (45 Ca) followed by collection of blood, feces, and urine every 24 h for 7 days. Total Ca and radioactivity were measured in all samples. At the end of the collection period, animals were slaughtered and samples of liver, heart, kidney, muscles and 12 th rib were taken for analysis. Calcium metabolism was evaluated by the models proposed by Vitti et al. (2000) and Fernandez (1995). A completely randomized design was used and means were compared by the Duncan test. No significant differences were observed for Ca intake among treatments. However, total fecal excretion of Ca differed and was lowest in animals fed LM. Calcium balance was negative in sheep receiving AH and CP because Ca absorption might have been compromised by the high contents of pectin and oxalate in these two supplements, respectively. Flows of Ca between the central pool and the digestive tract showed the greatest absorption of Ca on animals fed LM. Diets supplemented with LM, DP, and SM had highest Ca availability with values of 65. 38, 34. 12 and 32. 43 %, respectively. The models differed in the predictions of Ca flows among blood, bone and soft tissues but showed similar values for Ca balance in the different compartments. These discrepant results may be explained by structural difference between models...|$|E

As mudas foram transplantadas em setembro de 2008, no espaÃamento de 3, 5 m entre fileiras duplas, 1, 9 m entre fileiras simples e 1, 6 m entre plantas na linha. As parcelas foram constituÃdas de 8 plantas, considerando como parcela Ãtil as 4 plantas centrais. Cinco doses de nitrogÃnio (70, 490, 700, 910 e 1329 kg N ha- 1), cinco de fÃsforo (17, 122, 174, 227 e 332 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1) e cinco de potÃssio (44, 310, 443, 576 e 842 kg K 2 O ha- 1) foram combinadas {{conforme}} a matriz experimental Pan Puebla II e distribuÃdas em um delineamento em blocos casualizados, com cinco repetiÃÃes. A fonte de nitrogÃnio utilizada foi urÃia, de fÃsforo foi o fosfato monoamÃnico, e de potÃssio foi o cloreto de potÃssio. As doses de NPK foram divididas em sete aplicaÃÃes, sendo a primeira realizada em outubro de 2008 e repetida mensalmente. Foram realizadas coletas de dados biomÃtricos (comprimento e circunferÃncia do pseudocaule e nÃmero de folhas) no perÃodo de 120 atÃ 210 dias apÃs o transplantio (DAT). Coletaram-se folhas das plantas para a anÃlise dos teores de NPK. Aos 305 DAT colheram-se os cachos, que foram despencados, pesados e avaliados quanto ao nÃmero de palmas e nÃmero de frutos. A combinaÃÃo das doses que proporcionou melhores resultados de crescimento e produÃÃo da bananeira âPacovan Apodiâ foi de 490, 227 e 576 kg ha- 1 ciclo- 1. O incremento nas doses de nitrogÃnio influenciou negativamente o comprimento do pseudocaule e o nÃmero de palmas. A adubaÃÃo fosfatada proporcionou resposta positiva para nÃmero de folhas, peso do cacho e produtividade, e nÃo houve resposta da bananeira Ã adubaÃÃo potÃssica nas caracterÃsticas avaliadas. Os teores foliares de N, P e K nÃo foram significativamente influenciados pelas doses de N, P 2 O 5 e K 2 O. This research {{aimed to}} study the effect of different NPK rates related to growth and production of banana tree âPacovan Apodiâ, carrying out an experiment on the experimental field of enterprise FRUTACOR, {{in the district of}} Cercado do Meio, located in the municipality of QuixerÃ, CearÃ State (Northeast Brazil). The experiment was conducted in September 2008, using seedlings of banana tree âPacovan Apodiâ, developed from tissue culture and placed in a 3, 5 m planting space in double rows, 1, 9 m in single rows and 1, 6 m between simple plant lines. Experimental plots consisted of 8 plants, considering 4 centralized plants as useful. Five doses of nitrogen (70, 490, 700, 910 and 1329 kg N ha- 1), five of phosphorus (17, 122, 174, 227 and 332 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1) and five of potassium (44, 310, 443, 576 and 842 kg K 2 O ha- 1) were arranged according to experimental matrix Pan Puebla II and distributed using the experimental design of randomized blocks, with five replications. The nitrogen source used was urea, phosphorus was the <b>mono-ammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and potassium was potassium chloride. NPK doses were divided in seven applications, being the first one conducted in October 2008 and the other monthly. Biometric data (pseudostem length, pseudostem diameter and number of leaves) was collected from 120 to 210 days after transplanting (DAT). Leaves were collected from each plot for analysis of NPK nutrient content. At 305 DAT grapes were harvested, tumbled down, weighed, evaluated and related to the number of palms and also the number of fruits. The combination of doses which promoted the best growth results and production of banana tree âPacovan Apodiâ was composed by 490, 227 and 576 kg ha- 1 cycle- 1. Increase in N rates affected pseudostem length and number of palms. Phosphate fertlization reached positive results facing the number of leaves, weight of bunch and productivity, and banana tree âPacovan Apodiâ presented no answer to potassium fertilization considering characteristics evaluated on the experiment. There was no significant effect of N, P 2 O 5 and K 2 O rates on foliar nutrient concentration...|$|E
