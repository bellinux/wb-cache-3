25|$|With an {{estimated}} 650,000 {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS and an ever-greater number of people at risk of infection, the government has embarked upon a formidable task. The provision of accessible testing and treatment services not only requires financial resources, but also, in many cases, reorganization and supplementary funding of existing local health services infrastructure, especially in rural areas where most of Chinese HIV-positive individuals reside. In particular, rural areas do not have adequately trained staff capable of providing effective treatment and prevention services, {{as well as the}} laboratory and clinical infrastructure necessary to monitor treatment. The problem of inadequate human resources is not restricted to health departments – in rural areas, there are few adequately trained technical and <b>management</b> <b>personnel</b> at all levels and across all sectors. The combination of insufficiently trained staff, inadequate technical resources, and a largely remote, poorly educated, rural population represents a challenge to the implementation of effective programmes.|$|E

For analysis of the enterprise <b>management</b> and <b>personnel</b> <b>management</b> were used two research methods: a semicontrolled interview and a reseach method using questionnaires. The semicontrolled interview was applied {{to find out how}} management sees the current state of enterprise <b>management</b> and <b>personnel</b> <b>management.</b> The research method using questionnaires was applied to find out what would employees change to their satisfaction and to find out how employees see {{the current state of the}} <b>personnel</b> <b>management.</b> Altogether the employees are satisfied with the work. In general, the enterprise <b>management</b> and the <b>personnel</b> <b>management</b> in the selected enterprise can be evaluated as good and effective but with minor deficiencies. The management could be more open to change and respond to significant changes more quickly. To eliminate deficiencies were suggested the improvements of possibilities of proposing amendments by employees, to improve communication from the bottom up, support career development, training and staff development. For improving the atmosphere in the workplace and strengthening relationships was suggested organizing social event and sports day.
