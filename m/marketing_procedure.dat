40|$|We {{identify}} {{an important}} class of economic problems that arise naturally in several applications: {{the allocation of}} multiple resources when there are uncertainties in demand or supply, unresponsive supplies (no inventories and fixed capacities), and significant demand indivisibilities (rigidities). Examples of such problems include: scheduling job shops, airports, or supercomputers; zero-inventory planning; and the allocation and pricing of NASA's planned Space Station. Using experimental methods, we show that the two most common organizations used {{to deal with this}} problem, <b>markets</b> and administrative <b>procedures,</b> can perform at very low efficiencies (60 - 65 % efficiency in a seemingly robust example). Thus, {{there is a need to}} design new mechanisms that more efficiently allocate resources in these environments. We develop and analyze two mechanisms that arise naturally from auctions used to allocate single-dimensional goods. These new mechanisms involve computer-assisted coordination made possible by the existence of networked computers.
