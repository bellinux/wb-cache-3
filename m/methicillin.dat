5|$|The {{detected}} compounds are polyols {{and have}} an antifungal and antibacterial effect, especially in connection with Gram-positive bacteria. H.olivaceoalbus is therefore {{an important source of}} antibiotics, especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are resistant against contemporary antibiotics such as <b>methicillin,</b> ciprofloxacin or vancomycin. The fungus has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known for its curing components, such as 4-, 6- or 4,5,6-tri-O-acetyl hygrophorones B14.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable {{than many}} other {{penicillins}} and can be given orally, in addition to parenteral routes. However, like <b>methicillin,</b> it is less potent than benzylpenicillin against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{flucloxacillin}} being {{insensitive to}} beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance {{to it and}} other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including <b>methicillin.</b> Such organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has developed resistance to flucloxacillin and other penicillins by having an altered penicillin-binding protein.|$|E
25|$|Among {{people with}} staphylococcal {{bacteremia}} (SAB), {{one study found}} a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in nosocomial SAB. However, only 2% of strains were resistant to <b>methicillin</b> and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of β-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam {{ring of the}} penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as <b>methicillin,</b> nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin, are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to <b>methicillin</b> is {{mediated}} via the mec operon, {{part of the}} staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Resistance is conferred by the mecA gene, which codes for an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a or PBP2') that has a lower affinity for binding β-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). This allows for resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections. As such, the glycopeptide vancomycin is often deployed against MRSA.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result {{from the use of}} antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level <b>methicillin</b> was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E

2500|$|... β-Lactamase-resistant semisynthetic {{penicillins}} such as <b>methicillin</b> (and its successors, nafcillin and cloxacillin) {{were subsequently}} developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci.|$|E
2500|$|Today, S. aureus {{has become}} {{resistant}} to many commonly used antibiotics. [...] In the UK, only 2% of all S. aureus isolates {{are sensitive to}} penicillin, with a similar picture {{in the rest of}} the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (<b>methicillin,</b> oxacillin, cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant S. aureus, and are still used as first-line treatment. [...] <b>Methicillin</b> was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of MRSA was reported in England.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is the potential}} to predict antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria. A single mass spectral peak can predict <b>methicillin</b> resistance of Staphylococcus aureus [...] MALDI can also detect carbapenemase of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including Acinetobacter baumannii [...] and Klebsiella pneumoniae.|$|E
2500|$|Penicillinase was {{the first}} β-lactamase to be identified: It was first {{isolated}} by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from Gram-negative [...] E. coli even before penicillin entered clinical use, but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or produced it only rarely. [...] Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as <b>methicillin</b> were developed, but there is now widespread resistance to even these.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 the FDA {{cleared the}} first bacteriophage-based product for in vitro {{diagnostic}} use. [...] The KeyPath MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test uses a cocktail of bacteriophage to detect Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures and determine <b>methicillin</b> resistance or susceptibility. [...] The test returns results in about 5 hours, compared to 2–3 days for standard microbial identification and susceptibility test methods. [...] It {{was the first}} accelerated antibiotic susceptibility test approved by the FDA.|$|E
5000|$|Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It {{is similar}} to <b>methicillin,</b> and has {{replaced}} <b>methicillin</b> in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and <b>methicillin,</b> antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA is treated using vancomycin.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} semi-synthetic {{production}} involves the drug ampicillin. A beta lactam antibiotic just like penicillin, ampicillin {{was developed by}} adding an addition amino group (NH2) to the R group of penicillin. This additional amino group gives ampicillin a broader spectrum of use than penicillin. <b>Methicillin</b> is another derivative of penicillin and was discovered in the late 1950s, the key difference between penicillin and <b>methicillin</b> being the addition of two methoxy groups to the phenyl group. These methoxy groups allow <b>methicillin</b> to be used against penicillinase producing bacteria {{that would otherwise be}} resistant to penicillin.|$|E
50|$|The tea {{component}} epicatechin gallate {{is being}} researched because in vitro experiments showed it can reverse <b>methicillin</b> resistance in bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. If confirmed, {{this means the}} combined intake of a tea extract containing this component might also enhance the effectiveness of <b>methicillin</b> treatment against some resistant bacteria in vivo.|$|E

50|$|In a 2005 study, Fernandes et al. {{determined}} that cefoxitin {{serves as an}} appropriate replacement for <b>methicillin</b> in determining if a bacteria displays <b>methicillin</b> resistance. Likewise, Funsun et al. found in a 2009 study that cefoxitin disk assays correctly identified all 60 mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA isolates, to be resistant to cefoxitin.|$|E
5000|$|... mecA is a {{biomarker}} gene {{responsible for}} resistance to <b>methicillin</b> and other β-lactam antibiotics. After acquisition of mecA, the gene must be integrated and localized in the S. aureus chromosome. mecA encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind <b>methicillin</b> or other β-lactam antibiotics. As such, PBP2a {{can continue to}} catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for peptidoglycan cross-linking, enabling cell wall synthesis {{in the presence of}} antibiotics. As a consequence of the inability of PBP2a to interact with β-lactam moieties, acquisition of mecA confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to <b>methicillin.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... paper must be {{purchased}} from the publisher. In Elk's view, orismology includes etymology {{and should not}} be confused with terminology, which focuses on current and immediate interpretations of words. He gives this example: The drug name penicillin was coined by Alexander Fleming from the Latin for paintbrush, which is penicillus. <b>Methicillin,</b> a type of penicillin, gained its name by attaching the stem -cillin (from the United States Adopted Names Council's list of stems) to a prefix meth which has no inherent meaning. The study of penicillin and <b>methicillin</b> individually would be an etymological study of terminology. However, the study of <b>methicillin</b> as its name derived from penicillin historically might best be described, according to Elk, as orismologic.|$|E

5000|$|Due, in part, to the {{unavailability}} of <b>methicillin</b> in the United States, cefoxitin {{has replaced}} <b>methicillin</b> for disk diffusion tests, which determine {{the sensitivity of}} a bacterial specimen to a given antibiotic. Cefoxitin also yields more accurate results for disk diffusion tests. Interpretive criteria for determining susceptibility to cefoxitin via disk diffusion are {{greater than or equal}} to 22mm resulting in a [...] "susceptible" [...] result for Staphylococcus aureus and {{greater than or equal to}} 25mm for coagulase-negative staphylococci to be considered susceptible.|$|E
50|$|Meticillin (INN), {{also known}} as <b>methicillin</b> (USAN), is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam {{antibiotic}} of the penicillin class. It {{should not be confused}} with the antibiotic metacycline.|$|E
