5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> adaptations show it early in the play, because the audience {{is familiar with the}} story.

5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue {{and a few}} brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> conclusions to a league season in the history of the English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was lifted a year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title decider also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book Fever Pitch.|$|E

A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority.

5|$|From May2 to 8, 1999, a large tornado {{outbreak}} {{took place}} {{across much of}} the Central and parts of the Eastern United States, as well as southern Canada.

The <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> events unfolded during the afternoon of May3 through {{the early morning hours of}} May4 when more than half of these storms occurred. Oklahoma experienced its largest tornado outbreak on record, with 70confirmed. The most notable of these was the F5 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado which devastated Oklahoma City and suburban communities. The tornado killed 36people and injured 583others; losses amounted to $1billion, making it the first billion-dollar tornado in history. Overall, 50people lost their lives during the outbreak and damage amounted to $1.4billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} affairs the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> event during Douglas-Home's premiership was {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy in November 1963.

Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods. The beginning is recalled {{in the middle and}} at the end. The following table is based on the score and on an analysis by Katherine FitzGibbon. The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The work is in D minor and common time. The tempo marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} other events {{during the year}} in which Houses compete which are not sports related, notably House Music, a day set aside for the Houses to compete in a music event, {{involving}} a choir incorporating the entire House, and House Drama, another day that promotes theatre throughout the school. The difference between these events is that House Music is compulsory for all students in all Houses, but House Drama is not because, as with <b>most</b> <b>dramatics,</b> auditions are held. House Drama and House Music happen in alternate years. House dance also takes place although participation is also not compulsory. In 2016-17 several other events have been added during the academic year such as Chess, Biology Challenge and Languages to name but a few.|$|R

5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} of the <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E
