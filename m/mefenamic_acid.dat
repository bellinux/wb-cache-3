40|$|In {{cultures}} of mouse or chick embryo ceils several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, Ibufenac, phenylbutazone, Indomethacin, flufenamic and <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acids,</b> CI- 583, and chloroquine) inhibit the multi-plication of various viruses (encephalomyocarditis, S ndbis, influenza A 2, Newcastle disease, herpes implex and vaccinia). Two factors were {{critical for the}} virus inhibitory action of these drugs: the concentration of serum and the pH of the medium. The antiviral effect of these drugs seems to be due mainly to limitation of intraceUular synthesis. However, salicylates and anthranilates also inhibit the adsorption and/or penetration of encephalo-myocarditis virus into mouse cells. The antiviral potency shows some correlation with other biochemical, cellular and clinical activities of these drugs...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{conformational analysis}} of fenamates, which are N-arylated derivatives of anthranilic acid or 2 -aminonicotinic acid with different substituents on the aryl (phenyl) group, is reported. The {{analysis of these}} analgesics, which are believed to act through the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, was carried out using semi-empirical potential functions. The results and available crystallographic observations have been critically examined {{in terms of their}} relevance to drug action. Crystallographic studies of these drugs and their complexes have revealed that the fenamate molecules share a striking invariant feature, namely, the sixmembered ring bearing the carboxyl group is coplanar with the carboxyl group and the bridging imino group,the coplanarity being stabilized by resonance interactions and an internal hydrogen bond between the imino and carboxyl groups. The results of the theoretical analysis provide a conformational rationale for the observed invariant coplanarity. The second sixmembered ring, which provides hydrophobicity in a substantial part of the molecule, has limited conformational flexibility in meclofenamic, <b>mefenamic</b> and flufenamic <b>acids.</b> Comparison of the conformational energy maps of these acids shows that they could all assume the same conformation when bound to the relevant enzyme. The present study provides a structural explanation for the difference in the activity of niflumic acid, which can assume a conformation in which the whole molecule is nearly planar. The main role of the carboxyl group appears to be to provide a site for intermolecular interactions in addition to helping in stabilizing the invariant coplanar feature and providing hydrophilicity {{at one end of the}} molecule. The fenamates thus provide a good example of conformation- dependent molecular asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) induce apoptosis in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines. Similar {{actions on}} normal gastric epithelial cells {{could contribute to}} NSAID gastropathy. The present work therefore compared the actions of diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the cyclo-oxygenase- 2 selective inhibitor, NS- 398, on a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells. Cell number was assessed by staining with crystal violet. Apoptotic activity was determined by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and by assay of caspase- 3 -like activity. Necrosis was evaluated from release of cellular enzymes. Ibuprofen (250 [*]μM for 24 [*]h) promoted cell loss, and apoptosis, under both basal conditions and when apoptosis was increased by 25 [*]μM N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C 6 -ceramide). Diclofenac (250 [*]μM for 24 [*]h) reduced the proportion of apoptotic nuclei from 5. 2 to 2. 1 %, and caused inhibition of caspase- 3 -like activity, without causing necrosis under basal conditions. No such reduction in apoptotic activity {{was evident in the}} presence of 25 [*]μM C 6 -ceramide. The inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal caspase- 3 -like activity was also exhibited by the structurally similar <b>mefenamic</b> and flufenamic <b>acids</b> (1 – 250 [*]μM), but not by niflumic acid. Inhibition of superoxide production by the cells increased caspase- 3 -like activity, but the inhibitory action of diclofenac on caspase activity remained. Diclofenac did not affect superoxide production. Diclofenac inhibited caspase- 3 -like activity in cell homogenates and also inhibited human recombinant caspase- 3. In conclusion, NSAIDs vary in their effect on apoptotic activity in a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells, and the inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal apoptosis could involve an action on caspase activity...|$|R

Model drugs were (1) flufenamic acid and (2) <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> ^ A structurally related compound, <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> stabilizes the metastable form of flufenamic acid against solid state polymorphic transformation. It was shown that <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> attached on the (100) face of flufenamic acid crystals or was incorporated into flufenamic acid crystals. Stabilization could be achieved by inhibiting nucleation of the new phase and by decreasing the difference in free energy between two polymorphs. ^ In sublimation study, it was shown that <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> Form I crystals grew on the (100) faces of flufenamic acid Form I and Form III with different affinity and orientations. Differences in affinity and orientations {{can be explained by}} comparing lattice matching pattern, hydrogen bonding patterns and conformational similarities of <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> to those of flufenamic acid polymorphs. ^ Solubility study of flufenamic acid and <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was conducted with solvent having different polarity. From this study, it was shown that (a) the behaviors between flufenamic acid and <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> were similar in solvent with high polarity but different in solvents with low polarity and that (b) the solubility of <b>mefenamic</b> <b>acid</b> could be increased as many as seven times in some solvents when flufenamic acid is present.
