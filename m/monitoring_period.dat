2500|$|In 2002 Singapore {{commissioned}} {{its first}} reclaimed water plant, thus opening a [...] "Third Tap". This was done carefully, after a <b>monitoring</b> <b>period</b> {{of two years}} to ensure safe water quality. There was also an active marketing campaign that included {{the opening of a}} visitor center, the sale of NEWater in bottles and the Prime Minister drinking a bottle of NEWater in front of the cameras. In 2005 Singapore opened its first seawater desalination plant, the [...] "Fourth Tap". In the meantime it also further expanded its reservoirs, the [...] "First Tap". Today's largest reservoir, the Marina Bay reservoir, was inaugurated in 2008. It is located in the estuary of a river that has been closed off by a barrage to keep the seawater out. Two similar barrages were completed in July 2011, forming the Punggol Reservoir and the Serangoon Reservoir. When the 1961 water agreement with Malaysia ended in August 2011, Singapore could thus afford to let it expire.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first direct comparison of variations in seasonal GWS derived from GRACE TWS and simulated SM with GW-level measurements in a semiarid region. Results showed that variations in GWS and SM {{are the main}} sources controlling TWS changes over the High Plains, with negligible storage changes from surface water, snow, and biomass. Seasonal variations in GRACE TWS compare favorably with combined GWS from GW-level measurements (total 2, 700 wells, average 1, 050 GW-level measurements per season) and simulated SM from the Noah land surface model (R = 0. 82, RMSD = 33 mm). Estimated uncertainty in seasonal GRACE-derived TWS is 8 mm, and estimated uncertainty in TWS changes is 11 mm. Estimated uncertainty in SM changes is 11 mm and combined uncertainty for TWS-SM changes is 15 mm. Seasonal TWS changes are detectable in 7 out of 9 <b>monitored</b> <b>periods</b> and maximum changes within a year (e. g. between winter and summer) are detectable in all 5 <b>monitored</b> <b>periods.</b> Grace-derived GWS calculated from TWS-SM generally agrees with estimates based on GW-level measurements (R = 0. 58, RMSD = 33 mm). Seasonal TWS-SM changes are detectable in 5 out of the 9 <b>monitored</b> <b>periods</b> and maximum changes are detectable in all 5 <b>monitored</b> <b>periods.</b> Good correspondence between GRACE data and GW-level measurements from the intensively monitored High Plains aquifer validates the potential for using GRACE TWS and simulated SM to monitor GWS changes and aquifer depletion in semiarid regions subjected to intensive irrigation pumpage. This method {{can be used to}} monitor regions where large-scale aquifer depletion is ongoing, and in situ measurements are limited, such as the North China Plain or western India. This potential should be enhanced by future advances in GRACE processing, which will improve the spatial and temporal resolution of TWS changes, and will further increase applicability of GRACE data for monitoring GWS...|$|R

50|$|A {{sample is}} {{continuously}} {{extracted from the}} gas stream being monitored using a titanium probe, which is water-cooled to below 70 °C. The sample flow rate is automatically adjusted to ensure isokinetic sampling (the velocity of gas entering the sampling system {{is equal to the}} velocity of the gas in the system under test). The sample gas is drawn through a quartz wool pre-filter and then across a cartridge filled with resin, such as XAD 2. The sample gas is also cooled to below 5 °C to condense and remove water vapour. All system parameters are recorded digitally during sampling. The resin cartridge and the condensate are removed {{at the end of a}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>period,</b> and the contents are analysed to determine levels of dioxins and furans.|$|E

The experiment was performed in a completely randomized design, with six treatments (control, bentazon, sulfentrazone, isoxaflutole, atrazine and glyphosate) and five replications. The herbicide treatments were applied with a stationary sprayer, and electron transport rate (ETR) was subsequently analyzed with OS 5 p Multi-Mode Chlorophyll Fluorometer. In the <b>monitored</b> <b>period,</b> guanandi plants subjected to atrazine showed higher sensitivity to chlorophyll fluorescence than the other treatments.
