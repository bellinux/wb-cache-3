5|$|When Thompson assumed <b>majority</b> <b>ownership</b> of the renamed Fairbanks Daily News-Miner {{in early}} 1909, {{it was one}} of three daily {{newspapers}} in Fairbanks. The other two were the Fairbanks Times and the Tanana Daily Tribune. Competition among the three newspapers was intense, and they often clashed about issues such as city council meetings, a permanent bridge over the Chena River, and the mineral prospects of the town of Iditarod, where gold had just been discovered. The intense rivalries were driven by the declining economic situation in Fairbanks, as the initial gold findings that inspired the Fairbanks Gold Rush began to wane.|$|E

We have implemented the DEA methodology to calculate the yearly scores for technical, allocative, and cost efficiencies for the three groups of banks. Moreover, we have extended our study to reveal the factors that shape bank efficiency, by proposing several micro and macroeconomic variables and testing their correlation with this efficiency. Firstly, our results did not prove {{significant differences between the}} efficiency of the three groups of banks. However, the evolution of the efficiency scores over the period under study shows an improvement in the performance of banks with <b>majority</b> foreign <b>ownership,</b> but some deterioration in the performance of banks with <b>majority</b> domestic <b>ownership</b> and the subsidiaries of foreign banks. Secondly, and with respect to the factors affecting bank efficiency, we found that the employed variables have different impacts according to groups, which may confirm that bank efficiency is differently determined, according to bank ownership...|$|R

We consider the political influence of both the board chairs them-selves, by considering {{whether or not they}} ever served as government officials, and that of firm owners, indicated by <b>majority</b> state <b>ownership.</b> We find that politically connected board chairs have greater excess compensation for non-state owned firms, but not for state owned firms. This is consistent with board chair political connections being related to a form managerial entrench-ment, which can be mitigated by <b>majority</b> state <b>ownership...</b>|$|R

30|$|Hansen’s (1982) J Chi square is {{insignificant}} in both models, {{which indicates that}} the instruments are uncorrelated with the error term. A significant first-stage regression partial R-square shows that the instruments are correlated with innovation and <b>majority</b> international <b>ownership.</b> Both these tests, showing that the (1) instruments are correlated with the independent and instrumented variables and (2) uncorrelated with the error term, indicate that we have used valid instruments in our estimations (for a further discussion of the validation of instruments, see, e.g., Stock et al. 2002).
