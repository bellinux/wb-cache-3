5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as <b>malted</b> <b>barley,</b> {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for <b>malted</b> <b>barley.</b> Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E
5|$|Wheat beer is brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of <b>malted</b> <b>barley.</b> Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law).

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from <b>malted</b> <b>barley,</b> though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E

40|$|The {{productivity}} {{and quality of}} <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> were evaluated using factorial combinations of four preceding crops: faba bean, field pea, rapeseed and barley as main plots, and four nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 18, 36 and 54 kg N ha- 1) as sub-plots with three replications, at two sites on Nitisols of the Ethiopian highlands in 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Preceding crops other than barley, and N fertilizer significantly improved yield and quality of <b>malting</b> <b>barley.</b> The highest grain yield, kernel plumpness, protein content and sieve test were obtained for <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> grown after faba bean, followed by rapeseed and field pea. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased yield, protein content and sieve test of <b>malting</b> <b>barley.</b> All protein contents were within the acceptable range for malting quality.

We conclude that to maximize yield and quality of <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> {{it is critical to}} consider the preceding crop and soil nitrogen status.

25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of <b>malted</b> <b>barley)</b> into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E

We evaluated the effects of tillage and cropping sequence combination and N fertilization on dryland <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> and pea yields, grain characteristics, N uptake, and N use-efficiency from 2006 to 2011 in eastern Montana. Treatments were no-tilled continuous <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> (NTCB), no-tilled <b>malt</b> barley-pea (NTB-P), no-tilled malt barley-fallow (NTB-F), and conventional-tilled malt barley-fallow (CTB-F), each with 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha- 1. As N rates increased, <b>malt</b> <b>barley</b> grain yield, protein concentration, and N uptake increased in NTB-F, NTB-P, and NTCB, but test weight, plumpness, and N-use efficiency decreased in all tillage and cropping sequence combinations. Similarly, plant stand, biomass (stems and leaves) yield, and N uptake increased with increased N rates. Grain and biomass yields, N uptake, and N-use efficiency were greater in CTB-F than in NTB-P and NTCB but tillage had no effect on these parameters. <b>Malt</b> <b>barley</b> and pea yields and N uptake varied with cropping sequences and N rates among years.

30|$|The grain protein {{concentrations}} of <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> recorded from all treated plots were within the threshold range of grain protein content set by Assela Malt factory for malting purpose, 9.5 – 11 %. Despite {{the fact that}} integrated applications of organic and mineral fertilizers gave optimum values in this study, care need {{to be given to}} timing of N application as it significantly influences the grain protein contents of <b>malting</b> <b>barley.</b> Previous studies including Kara (2010) showed that grain protein content of <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> increased with late-season N application. Therefore, it should be taken into account that N top-dressing of <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> at its late stage will increase protein content in grain beyond the upper limit for malting use. The N requirement of the crop at its latest stage is expected to be fulfilled by the mineralization of organic amendments so that growers need to be cautious about top-dressing at booting stage. Though grain protein content of <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> did not surpass the upper threshold limit during the 2 -year study, there may be a chance of increased mineralization of N at the late stage of the crop development depending on environmental conditions. Therefore, seeding <b>malting</b> <b>barley</b> with low protein content, such as the variety used in this study, lowers the risk of the grain protein content exceeding beyond the threshold limit (O’Donovan et al. 2015). Besides, monitoring of grain quality on long-term application of organic amendments is required as the buildup and mineralization of N may increase grain protein concentrations.|$|R

500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally <b>malted</b> <b>barley)</b> with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
500|$|The grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat. [...] During the malting process, {{the wheat}} is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning {{furnaces}}.

[...] The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor. [...] This [...] process {{would not be possible}} in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors.

[...] The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content.
