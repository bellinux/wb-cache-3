5|$|The {{disease was}} named after the Brazilian {{physician}} and epidemiologist Carlos Chagas, who first described it in 1909. The disease was not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored). Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now Reduviidae: Triatominae) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the Trypanosoma genus, {{and was able to}} demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to <b>marmoset</b> monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed squirrel monkeys were also vulnerable to infection.|$|E
25|$|This is {{particularly}} true for the <b>marmoset.</b> Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their fraternal twins. 95% of <b>marmoset</b> fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.|$|E
25|$|Contributing {{factors were}} the anthropic {{introduction}} of invasive and predatory species of black rats, feral cats, mongooses and <b>marmoset</b> monkeys which prey on {{the eggs and}} young, and goats, sheep and cattle which destroy the regenerative growth of the woodland trees, particularly the Caraibeira seedlings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marmosets</b> can {{be found}} living wild in city parks in Brazil. Urban-dwelling <b>marmosets</b> tend to return more often to the same {{sleeping}} sites than jungle-dwelling <b>marmosets.</b> Urban-dwelling <b>marmosets</b> tend to prefer to sleep in tall trees with high first branches and smooth bark. It has been suggested they do this to avoid cats.|$|R
40|$|Common <b>marmosets</b> (Callithrix jacchus) {{developed}} {{high levels}} of viremia, clinical signs including fever, weight loss, a decrease in activity and hematuria upon inoculation with dengue virus (DENV). Presence of DENV genome in urine samples and pathological changes in kidneys were examined in the present study. Levels of DENV genome were determined in 228 urine samples from 20 primary DENV-inoculated <b>marmosets</b> and in 56 urine samples from four secondary DENV-inoculated <b>marmosets.</b> DENV genome was detected in 75 % (15 / 20) of <b>marmosets</b> after primary DENV infection. No DENV genome was detected in urine samples from the <b>marmosets</b> with secondary infection with homologous DENV (0 %, 0 / 4). Two <b>marmosets</b> demonstrated hematuria. Pathological analysis of the kidneys demonstrated non-suppressive interstitial nephritis with renal tubular regeneration. DENV antigen-positive cells were detected in kidneys. In human dengue virus infections, some patients present renal symptoms. The results indicate that <b>marmosets</b> recapitulate {{some aspects of the}} involvement of kidneys in human DENV infection, and suggest that <b>marmosets</b> are potentially useful for the studies of the pathogenesis of DENV infection, including kidneys...|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{research}} into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, {{it was found that}} anti-hCG antibodies prevent <b>marmoset</b> embryos from implanting in the endometrium of their mother's uterus.|$|E
25|$|Perceived pitch {{typically}} {{depends on}} the fundamental frequency, though the dependence could be mediated solely {{by the presence of}} harmonics corresponding to that fundamental frequency. The perception of a pitch without the corresponding fundamental frequency in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the missing fundamental. Neurons lateral to A1 in <b>marmoset</b> monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the fundamental frequency of a complex tone, suggesting that pitch constancy may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} a nest in urban São Paulo, {{it was noted that}} the swallow-tailed hummingbird mother drove away ruddy ground doves (Columbina talpacoti) {{attempting}} to nest nearby. Far more placid, cumbersome and meaty birds than the hummingbird, these small doves often become prey to smaller carnivores, and by chasing away the doves the hummingbird would have lowered attractiveness to its nest's surroundings to such predators. Smaller mammals, such as the common <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix jacchus) may occasionally plunder swallow-tailed hummingbird nests, despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.|$|E

5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and <b>marmosets.</b> They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as <b>marmosets.</b> Conversely, <b>marmosets</b> will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The <b>marmosets,</b> on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the <b>marmosets</b> to cover large distances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, several {{papers have}} shown that a small subset of retinal {{ganglion}} cells (RGCs), which project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and contain a new photopigment called melanopsin, are the photoreceptors involved in light-dark entrainment in rodents. In our primate colony, we found a couple of common <b>marmosets</b> (Callithrix jacchus) that had developed progressive and spontaneous visual deficiency, most likely because of retinal degeneration of cones and/or rods. In this study, we evaluated the photoresponsiveness of the circadian system of these blind <b>marmosets.</b> Methods Two blind and two normal <b>marmosets</b> were kept in cages with a controlled light-dark cycle (LD) to study photoentrainment, masking, and phase response to a dark pulse. Results Blind <b>marmosets</b> were entrained with the new LD cycle when light onsets were delayed and advanced by 6 hours. In constant light conditions, blind <b>marmosets</b> free-ran with a period of 23. 2 hours, while normal animals free-ran with a period of 23. 6 hours. All <b>marmosets</b> responded to dark pulses in the early subjective day with phase delays and with phase advances in the late subjective day. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that light can synchronize circadian rhythms of blind <b>marmosets</b> and consequently, that this species {{could be a good}} primate model for circadian photoreception studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{brains of}} three <b>marmosets</b> (Callithrix jacchus) {{injected}} intracerebrally 6 - 7 years earlier with brain tissue {{from a patient}} with early onset Alzheimer's disease were found to contain moderate numbers of amyloid plaques with associated argyrophilic dystrophic neurites and cerebral amyloid angiopathy but no neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques and vascular amyloid stained positively with antibodies to beta (A 4) -protein. The brains of three age-matched control <b>marmosets</b> from the same colony did not show these neuropathological features. The brain of one of two <b>marmosets</b> injected with brain tissue from a patient with prion disease with concomitant beta-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy also showed beta-amyloid plaques and angiopathy but no spongiform encephalopathy. An occasional plaque {{was found in the}} brains of two of four <b>marmosets</b> injected with brain tissue from three elderly patients with age-related pathology, two of whom had an additional diagnosis of possible prion disease. Neither plaques nor cerebral amyloid angiopathy were found in six other <b>marmosets</b> who were older than the injected animals, in 12 further <b>marmosets</b> who were slightly younger but who had been injected several years previously with brain tissue which did not contain beta-amyloid, or in 10 younger <b>marmosets</b> who had been subjected to various neurosurgical procedures.

500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa, such as cheirogaleid lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered [...] "primitive" [...] forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors. Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapis). [...] If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on {{the shape of the}} anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus Callithrix (a type of <b>marmoset).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Pygmy {{marmosets}} {{have been}} studied and found to produce complex vocalizations 2–3 weeks after birth. Both sexes are capable of creating calls {{at a rate of}} 3 calls/second and each bout of calls can last up to 6 or 7 minutes. A normal series of calls by a pygmy <b>marmoset</b> contains approximately 10 different call types. This variety of call forms produced by this creature is comparable to babbling in human infants for a number of reasons. Like reduplicative babbling in humans, the call is often repeated several times before a new sequence of sounds is produced. [...] The vocalizations gain attention from caregivers and provide practice for future vocal behavior. For these reasons, pygmy <b>marmoset</b> calls are seen as babbling behavior.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{total of}} 16 call types in pygmy <b>marmoset</b> {{babbling}} language. Different calls serve different survival functions such as when desiring food, social interaction or during times of alarm. As human infants have, <b>marmoset</b> babies have higher rates of social interaction when producing babbling sounds. During the juvenile age, marmosets often regress back to babbling stages if a new infant is born. It is suggested that their production of babbling calls increases because they are seeking attention and social interaction. Another babbling occurrence during the juvenile age is the addition of territorial calls and mild threat vocalizations. Although babbling is important for practising adult calls during the juvenile age, babbling decreases with age in pygmy marmosets. [...] Overall, babbling progresses {{through a series of}} stages from infancy to adulthood and slowly leads to the construction of adult calls.|$|E

40|$|An adaptive, {{evolutionary}} {{approach to}} animal intelligence predicts variation among species in cognitive abilities favored by different environments. Different foods present diverse {{spatial and temporal}} tracking problems for foragers, possibly favoring disparate learning and memory abilities in different species. Lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) and <b>marmosets</b> (Callithrix kuhli) differ markedly in feeding ecology. <b>Marmosets</b> specialize on gum, a plentiful and renewable resource, whereas lion tamarins focus on ripe fruit, a spatially patchy and temporally ephemeral resource. Lion tamarins apparently need to remember the location and status of food sources for longer time periods than <b>marmosets.</b> I tested individuals of both species on two spatial memory tasks, a radial maze analog and a win-stay task. On both tasks, lion tamarins remembered information about the location of food for longer temporal intervals than did <b>marmosets,</b> but <b>marmosets</b> performed better than lion tamarins after very short retention intervals. A third spatial task showed that increasing memory loads did not differentially affect memory-based performance. On a color delayed match-to-sample task, both species required extensive training and performed poorly compared to the spatial tasks. As in the spatial tasks, lion tamarins remembered information about the color of food sources for longer temporal intervals than did <b>marmosets.</b> The results of these four studies suggest that, relative to <b>marmosets,</b> lion tamarins possess an adaptively specialized system for remembering the location, and perhaps color, of food sources. Differences in brain regions involved in spatial and object memory may underlie these species differences in memory. These studies suggest that diet has been a potent selective force {{in the evolution of}} memory in lion tamarins and <b>marmosets,</b> and perhaps in other primates, including humans, as well. ...|$|R
