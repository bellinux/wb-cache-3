5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} {{are not going to}} secondary school and differences between gross enrolment ration (GER) and net enrolment ratio (NER) indicate that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> are over-age. GER is the percentage of children enrolled out of the population of appropriate age. NER is the percentage of children of appropriate age out of the population of that age.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{the country}} of India {{is home to the}} largest number of {{children}} who are working illegally in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> are forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, a large number of family members, poverty, and lack of parental education. This is often the major cause of the high rate of child labour in India.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman {{first became}} aware of the issue of human {{trafficking}} while he was working for the Christian nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia, where he met child victims of human trafficking, but Kooman later came to realize that human trafficking is an issue in Canada as well; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimate that between 600 and 800 people are trafficked into Canada every year. Kooman has spoken about the cases in which people have been trafficked into Calgary and Edmonton in order to work in the sex industry, and has posited that sex workers have likely been trafficked into his hometown of Red Deer as well since it is also located along Alberta Highway 2. Kooman continued to work in Malaysia with YWAM for two years, towards the end of which time he visited Singapore, where he attended an international conference on human trafficking, there learning details on the issue that shocked him. The conference focused on the military use of children and the prostitution of children. One of the facts that stuck with Kooman was that there are children aged five and under who are forcibly prostituted daily, and that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> end up spending their entire lives as human trafficking victims. Kooman is the director of Raise Their Voice, a creative, justice-driven, nonprofit organisation in Red Deer. The other four members of the organization are his family members.|$|E

500|$|Not My Life {{begins with}} a black screen on which the words [...] "Human {{trafficking}} is slavery" [...] appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} deprivations faced by street children {{is the lack of}} a protective and guiding adult, but some street children manage to find individuals to fulfill this role. Though most live on their own or with friends, some street children form connections with families that live on the streets or in slums and see these families as their substitute families. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> find a [...] "mother-figure" [...] that cares for them when they are ill and is interested in their well-being.|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, UCLES exams {{were taken}} by {{candidates}} based overseas - in Trinidad (from 1863), South Africa (from 1869), Guyana and New Zealand (from 1874), Jamaica (from 1882) and Malaya (from 1891). <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> candidates were <b>children</b> <b>of</b> officers of the British colonial service and exams were not yet designed for non-native speakers of English.|$|R
2500|$|According to Milton Friedman, {{before the}} Industrial Revolution {{virtually}} all children worked in agriculture. [...] During the Industrial Revolution <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> moved from farm work to factory work. [...] Over time, as real wages rose, parents became {{able to afford}} {{to send their children to}} school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went [...] "voluntarily and gladly" [...] to work in factories.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the wars}} Filton {{expanded}} rapidly, {{to become a}} suburb of Bristol. Initially development (semi-detached housing) was concentrated {{on the western side}} of the A38, in an area known as Filton Park. In the 30's, the area on {{the eastern side of the}} A38 started to be developed. Eventually, Filton became part of the Bristol conurbation, although it remained, as it does now, outside the city boundary. During the 20's and 30s, two infant/primary schools and one secondary school were built in Filton to accommodate the growing number of school-age children in the area. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> were evacuated when World War II started in 1939, but returned later, during the Phoney War.

2500|$|In his time, Hepburn was {{notorious for}} his philandering. The {{contemporary}} chronicler Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote that Hepburn [...] "ever {{was a master}} of whores all of his days and committed whoredom and adultery both with maidens and men's wives". By at least five different mistresses he produced at least thirteen illegitimate children. He had four sons and one daughter by Isabel Liddell, namely Patrick, Adam, George, John and Jane; by another mistress, Marion Strang, he had one son, whose name was William; with Janet Urquhart, he fathered another three sons and one daughter, Patrick, David, Thomas, and Joanna; with Elizabeth Innes, he sired a son named Alexander; and by a mistress whose name has not survived he had a further two daughters. Bishop Hepburn eventually had ten of his bastards legitimised, and indeed it is largely down to his efforts to achieve legitimisation that the names of <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> have been recorded in the Register of the Great Seal.|$|E

60|$|One {{band was}} busily {{engaged in a}} game exactly similar to our blind man's buff. Another set were walking on stilts, which raised the {{children}} three feet from the ground. They were very expert at this amusement, and seldom tumbled. In another place I observed a group of girls standing together, and apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I went up {{to see what they}} were doing, and found that they were opening their eyelids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous size, and then thrusting pieces of straw between the upper and lower lids, across the eyeball, to keep them in that position! This seemed to me, I must confess, a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement. Nevertheless, the children seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they made. I pondered this subject a good deal, and thought that if little children knew how silly they seemed to grown-up people when, they make faces, they would not be so fond of doing it. In another place were a number of boys engaged in flying kites; and I could not help wondering that some of the games of those little savages should be so like to our own, although they had never seen us at play. But the kites were different from ours in many respects, being of every variety of shape. They were made of very thin cloth, and the boys raised them to a wonderful height in the air by means of twine made from the cocoa-nut husk. Other games there were, some of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor savages, and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be sent out to them. But the amusement which the greatest number of the children of both sexes seemed to take chief delight in was swimming and diving in the sea, and the expertness which they exhibited was truly amazing. They seemed to have two principal games in the water, one of which was to dive off a sort of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea, and chase each other in the water. Some of them went down to an extraordinary depth; others skimmed along the surface, or rolled over and over like porpoises, or diving under each other, came up unexpectedly and pulled each other down by a leg or an arm. They never seemed to tire of this sport, and from the great heat of the water in the South Seas, they could remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they staggered down the beach, flung their round, fat little black bodies fearlessly into deep water, and struck out to sea with as much confidence as ducklings.|$|E
