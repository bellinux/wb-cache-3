5|$|By September15, shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout}} Tinian and Saipan at local schools, <b>most</b> <b>schools</b> and all governmental buildings {{were closed and}} residents rushed to board up their homes. The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time. Some private schools were open during the morning but let out early to allow students {{to return to their}} families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September15, by which time heavy rain had begun falling. Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands. The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands.

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>schools</b> were {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers}} and students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a job in the government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While <b>most</b> <b>schools</b> had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Scottish missionaries saw the {{construction}} of schools and welfare centres for the British. Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area. The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the Dr. Graham's Homes for destitute Anglo-Indian students. By 1907, <b>most</b> <b>schools</b> in Kalimpong started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population comprised many ethnic groups, including Nepalis, Lepchas, Tibetans, the Anglo-Indian community and the Marwari communities. Hence by 1911, the population had swollen to 7,880.|$|E

Statistics show that 18,208 students {{were enrolled in the}} city's secondary school system during the 1993–94 school year, while a further 7,660 attended one of the 18 professional schools. In the same year, another 37,111 pupils and 9,711 children were registered for primary and pre-school, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although <b>most</b> <b>schools</b> have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|Geralda was {{the second}} cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda {{produced}} wind gusts as strong as , which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including <b>most</b> <b>schools,</b> homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231people and caused over $10million in damage (1994USD). Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination, and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.|$|E
5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of Falcón, Sucre and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The Simón Bolívar International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its oil refinery in Curaçao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its largest oil refinery in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, where about 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one man trying to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage <b>most</b> <b>schools</b> and businesses were closed.

5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. <b>Most</b> <b>schools</b> were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. <b>Most</b> <b>schools</b> were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E
