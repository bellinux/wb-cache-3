40|$|Network coding (NC) is a {{promising}} technique recently {{proposed to improve}} network performance in terms of maximum throughput, <b>minimum</b> <b>delivery</b> delay, and energy consumption. The original proposal highlighted the advantages of NC for multicast communications in wire-line networks. Recently, network coding has been considered as an efficient approach to improve performance in wireless networks, mainly in terms of data reliability and lower energy consumption, especially for broadcast communications. The basic idea of NC is to remove the typical requirement that different information flows have to be processed and transmitted independently through the network. When NC is applied, intermediate nodes in the network do not simply relay the received packets, but they combine several received packets before transmission. As a consequence, the output flow at a given node is obtained as a linear combination of its input flows. This chapter deals with the application of network coding principle at different communications layers of the protocol stack, specifically, the Medium Access Control (MAC) and physical (PHY) Layers for wireless communication networks...|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} a wireless sender (e.g., a base station or a wireless access point) {{that wants to}} broadcast a set of N source packets forming a GOP, N = {P_ 1,...,P_N}, {{to a set of}} M receivers, M = {R_ 1,...,R_M}. Throughout this paper, we use calligraphic letters to denote sets and their corresponding capital letters to denote the cardinalities of these sets (e.g., N = | N|). A network coding scheme is applied on the packets of a single GOP as soon as all the packets are ready, which implies that neither merging of GOPs nor buffering of packets in more than one GOP at the sender is allowed. This significant aspect arises from the <b>minimum</b> <b>delivery</b> delay requirement in real-time video streaming. Time is slotted and the sender can transmit one packet per time slot t. There is a limit on the total number of allowable time slots Θ used to broadcast the N packets to the M receivers, as the deadline for the current GOP expires after Θ time slots. Therefore, at any time slot t∈ [1, 2,…,Θ], the sender can compute the number of remaining transmissions for the current GOP as, Q=Θ−t+ 1.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a distributed optimal Community-Aware Opportunistic Routing (CAOR) algorithm.
