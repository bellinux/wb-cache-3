[...] The last {{telephone}} conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> treasure.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{constant}} thefts, {{particularly of}} livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of Wonderful Adventures describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole {{did some of}} the cooking herself: [...] "Whenever I had a few leisure <b>moments,</b> <b>I</b> used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry." [...] When called to [...] "dispense medications," [...] she did so. Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings, noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit. The Special Correspondent of The Times newspaper wrote approvingly of her work: [...] "...Mrs. Seacole...doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battle-field to aid the wounded, and has earned many a poor fellow’s blessings." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West praised Fischer's [...] "masterful" [...] performance, {{writing that}} it [...] "really {{is nice to}} see Pam coming into her own... And I love that she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in — she just ran right up and hugged him." [...] West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining that with the former, [...] "Michael is never completely loathsome — because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that [...] "the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments." [...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right <b>moments.</b> <b>I</b> thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime." ...|$|E

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I am surprised how the margrave knew all the villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E
500|$|... "Rather Die Young" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Beyoncé Beyoncé, Jeff Bhasker, and Luke Steele at Enormous Studios, in Los Angeles, in 2011. Cole Kamen-Green, Alex Asher and Josiah Woodson played the trumpets while Nick Videen and Drew Sayers {{were on the}} tenor and alto saxophones. The horn were arranged by Shea Taylor. Jordan Young then recorded Beyoncé's vocals at the MSR Studios and KMA Studios, in New York City; Steele and Billy Kraven served as background vocalists. Tony Maserati mixed the track, while Pete Wolford, Ryan Kelly, Serge Nudel, Justin Hergett and Jon Castelliall all assisted in the audio engineering of [...] "Rather Die Young"; both tasks were executed at the RMC Studio, in Los Angeles. Speaking about what motivated her to record a song in the vein of [...] "Rather Die Young", Beyoncé said: [...] "I really {{want people to think}} when they listen to my music.

I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E

500|$|Cliff Martinez {{composed}} the film's soundtrack, which {{was his first}} score for Soderbergh since Solaris in 2002. Given that the pacing of the music was one of Soderbergh's biggest concerns, Martinez needed to maintain a brisk pace throughout the soundtrack, while also conveying fear and hope within the music. [...] "I tried to create the sound of anxiety. And at key, strategic <b>moments</b> <b>I</b> tried to use the music to conjure up the sense of tragedy and loss." [...] Martinez incorporated orchestral elements, and fused them with the predominantly electronic sounds of the score. He noted that the [...] "sound palette for Contagion came by way of combining three very different approaches Steven went through as he was cutting the film." [...] Martinez received a rough cut for the film in October 2010, which contained music that was imbued with elements of The French Connection (1971) and Marathon Man (1976). He [...] "loved" [...] those two soundtracks, and composed a few pieces in their style. A few months later, he acquired a new cut, which included music influenced by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. Toward the end, Soderbergh changed again and used contemporary soundtrack music that was [...] "more energetic and more rhythmic". Ultimately, Martinez used aspects of all three approaches: [...] "I reasoned that combining them would not only be effective but would give the score a style all its own." ...|$|E
500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage <b>moments.</b> <b>I</b> Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E

In those <b>moments,</b> <b>I</b> was not able to deal with that matter [...] I found myself immersed, principally, in the Crisis of October, in the war, in policy questions." [...] Castro personally said that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country's pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality.|$|E

2500|$|Kahlo's {{right leg}} was amputated {{at the knee}} due to {{gangrene}} in August 1953. She became severely depressed and anxious, and her dependency on painkillers escalated.

[...] She was again hospitalized in April and May. That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval. Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c. 1954) and Frida and Stalin (c. 1954), and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).|$|E

2500|$|The Riksdag of the Estates {{was well}} aware that queen Louisa Ulrika was {{responsible}} for the attempted coup d'état, and there were discussions as {{how to deal with the}} queens guilt. In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed". She officially replied the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured [...] "that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom": Troilius reported that [...] "only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best". The Arch Bishop reported, that he observed [...] "tears of rage and sorrow" [...] in her eyes.
