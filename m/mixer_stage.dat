50|$|The mixer circuit {{can be used}} {{not only}} to shift the {{frequency}} of an input signal as in a receiver, {{but also as a}} product detector, modulator, phase detector or frequency multiplier. For example, a communications receiver might contain two <b>mixer</b> <b>stages</b> for conversion of the input signal to an intermediate frequency and another mixer employed as a detector for demodulation of the signal.|$|R
50|$|A {{mixing chamber}} where a {{mechanical}} agitator brings in intimate contact the feed solution and the solvent {{to carry out}} the transfer of solute(s). The mechanical agitator is equipped with a motor which drives a mixing and pumping turbine. This turbine draws the two phases from the settlers of the adjacent stages, mixes them, and transfers this emulsion to the associated settler. The mixer may consists of one or multiple stages of mixing tanks. Common laboratory mixers consist of a single mixing stage, whereas industrial scale copper mixers may consist of up to three <b>mixer</b> <b>stages</b> where each stage performs a combined pumping and mixing action. Use of multiple stages allows a longer reaction time and also minimizes the short circuiting of unreacted material through the mixers.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{reconfigurable}} ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio (IR) transmitter is presented. The IR signal is synthesized at an intermediate frequency (IF) by employing a multi-Nyquist digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with 12 bit resolution and an update rate of 2. 3 GHz. Digital generation of signals {{in a field}} programmable gate array (FPGA) guarantees very high flexibility of the reconfigurable design. For upconversion to the radio frequency (RF) band, a first order bandpass (BP) sampling concept and an alternative conventional concept with <b>mixer</b> <b>stages,</b> have been realized. The system enables to generate signals with arbitrary modulation schemes and techniques at an external host personal computer (PC) employing MATLAB. Different measurements using a digitizing oscilloscope have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the transmitter...|$|R

40|$|A jet {{aircraft}} noise and sonic boom measuring device which converts sound pressure into electric current is described. An electric current {{proportional to the}} sound pressure level at a condenser microphone is produced and transmitted over a cable, amplified by a zero drive amplifier and recorded on magnetic tape. The converter is comprised of a local oscillator, a dual-gate field-effect transistor (FET) mixer and a voltage regulator/impedance translator. A carrier voltage that is applied {{to one of the}} gates of the FET mixer is generated by the local oscillator. The microphone signal is mixed with the carrier to produce an electrical current at the frequency of vibration of the microphone diaphragm by the FET mixer. The voltage of the local oscillator and <b>mixer</b> <b>stages</b> is regulated, the carrier at the output is eliminated, and a low output impedance at the cable terminals is provided by the voltage regulator/impedance translator...|$|R
50|$|Signal leakage paths {{can occur}} in the receiver. Local-{{oscillator}} energy can leak through the <b>mixer</b> <b>stage</b> to the antenna input and then reflect back into the <b>mixer</b> <b>stage.</b> The overall effect is that the local oscillator energy will self-mix and create a DC offset signal. The offset may {{be large enough to}} overload the baseband amplifiers and prevent receiving the wanted signal. There are design modifications that deal with this issue, but they add to the complexity of the receiver. The additional design complexity often outweighs the benefits of a direct-conversion receiver.|$|E
50|$|By {{varying the}} BFO {{frequency}} around 44000 Hz, the listener can vary the output audio frequency; {{this is useful}} to correct for small differences between the tuning of the transmitter and the receiver, particularly useful when tuning in single sideband (SSB) voice. The waveform produced by the BFO beats against the IF signal in the <b>mixer</b> <b>stage</b> of the receiver. Any drift of the local oscillator or the beat-frequency oscillator will affect the pitch of the received audio, so stable oscillators are used.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Armstrong {{invented the}} superheterodyne, a triode <b>mixer</b> <b>stage</b> design was {{developed}} {{that not only}} mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator. This {{was known as the}} autodyne mixer. Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first intermediate frequency transformer primary tuning capacitor, which was too small to give good feedback. Also keeping the oscillator signal out of the antenna circuit was difficult.|$|E
40|$|An ultra-wideband (UWB) {{software}} defined radio (SDR) implementation is presented. The developed impulse radio (IR) transceiver employs first order bandpass (BP) sampling at a conversion frequency which is four times the channel bandwidth. The subsampling architecture directly provides the RF signal avoiding any non-ideal <b>mixer</b> <b>stages</b> and reduces the requirements of digital signal processing implemented in a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA). The transmitter consists basically of a multi-Nyquist digital to analog converter (DAC), whereas the implemented matched filter (MF) receiver prototype employs a standard digitizing oscilloscope. This design can be adaptively reconfigured in terms of modulation, data rate, and channel equalization. The reconfigurable design is used for an extensive performance analysis of the quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme investigating the influence of different antennas, amplifiers, narrowband interferers as well as diff erent equalizer lengths. Even for distances up to 7 m in a multipath environment robust communication was achieved...|$|R

This novel architecture is based on sampling the cosmic noise wavefront at the antenna. It eliminates the usage of any intermediate frequency (IF) <b>mixer</b> <b>stages</b> (- 6 dB) and the noise balancing technique (- 3 dB), providing a minimum of 9 dB increase in performance. The DSP implements high-speed filtering and selects the appropriate centre frequencies and signal bandwidths. For {{the first time a}} riometer would automatically generate both the experimental and theoretical Quiet Day Curves (QDCs) and Absorption values. For the first time the full extent of Solar Radio Emissions (SREs Type III & IV) would be measured by a riometer, due to the receiver’s programmable sliding gain range. The programmable auto-correlator integration time allows in-depth observation of the different magnetospheric and ionospheric events.

5000|$|In a radio {{receiver}} circuit, the RF front end is a generic term {{for all the}} circuitry between the antenna {{up to and including}} the <b>mixer</b> <b>stage.</b> [...] It consists of all the components in the receiver that process the signal at the original incoming radio frequency (RF), before it is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF). In microwave and satellite receivers it is often called the low-noise block (LNB) or low-noise downconverter (LND) and is often located at the antenna, so that the signal from the antenna can be transferred {{to the rest of the}} receiver at the more easily handled intermediate frequency.|$|E
5000|$|A product {{detector}} {{is a type}} of demodulator used for AM and SSB signals, where the original carrier signal is removed by multiplying the received signal with a signal at the carrier frequency (or near to it). Rather than converting the envelope of the signal into the decoded waveform by rectification as an envelope detector would, the {{product detector}} takes the product of the modulated signal and a local oscillator, hence the name. By heterodyning, the received signal is mixed (in some type of nonlinear device) with a signal from the local oscillator, to give sum and difference frequencies to the signals being mixed, just as a first <b>mixer</b> <b>stage</b> in a superhet would produce an intermediate frequency; the beat frequency in this case, the low frequency modulating signal is recovered and the unwanted high frequencies filtered out from the output of the product detector.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{software}} {{radio receiver}} is {{one which is}} tuned to receive a transmitted signal on multiple communication standards through software rather than hardware. To incorporate multi-standard radio communications an intermediate frequency of high ranges is used. Such high intermediate frequencies when sampled with Nyquist rate gets oversampled due to the phenomenon of Band Pass sampling depending on the radio communication standard. Hence a digital down converter (DDC) capable of reducing the sampling rate {{in accordance with the}} radio communication standard is required. Cascaded Integrated Comb (CIC) filters are used for large sample rate conversion factors. In this paper an optimized architecture for DDC employing CORDIC in the <b>mixer</b> <b>stage</b> and the reconfigurable decimation factors for CIC filters has been implemented.

Opposite to the small cell philosophy popularized by modern wireless telephone service, free-to-air TV broadcast is historically driven by the need to extend the area of coverage, as doing so will garner a larger audience. So, commercial TV transmissions utilize tall aerial towers and power level in the 10 - 50 kW range in order to maximize their radio horizon. In comparison, the transmit power of a cellular repeater is many magnitude orders lower at ~ 50 W. Mobile TV allows the commuting public to watch TV programs on hand-held or portable devices [1]. The mobile TV functionality can be incorporated into notebook personal computers, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), In-Car-Entertainment (ICE) system [2], and cellular handsets, etc. Technically, the mobile TV poses a unique problem in that the distance between the transmitter and receiver can change considerably as the user travels to different locations. Given that only miniature aerials (i. e., low gain aerials) can be embedded in these portable products, the TV receiver must understandably be designed with very high sensitivity to permit clear reception at the coverage fringes.
