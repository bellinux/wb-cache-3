40|$|Main articleThe aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{possibility}} of using numerical methods in the sub-division of the palynological assemblages encountered upwards in the stratigraphic sequence in one borehole core situated in a central position in the Mid-Zambezi Basin, Rhodesia. Due to its apparently conformable thick succession and the variable micro-floras already encountered within it, this borehole has been proposed as a palynological type section for the Zambezi Basin, Rhodesia. The numerical methods used to delineate zones of similar assemblages were basically very simple, using only presence-absence data of a set range of species. The formulae employed were those of Jaccard, Simpson and Sokal (the only linear method), and the methods of classification were simplified forms of divisive or shaded half matrices, agglomerative using single linkage clustering, and spatial ordination techniques. The results support the concept of distinct changes of <b>microfloras</b> up the stratigraphic sequence. Groups of assemblages bearing similar <b>microfloras</b> appear stratigraphically adjacent to one another, barring certain minor instances of transition floras in the younger sequences.

40|$|The {{colonization}} {{and resistance}} dynamics of aerobic gram-negative {{bacteria in the}} intestinal and oropharyngeal <b>microfloras</b> of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and general wards were investigated during and after hospitalization. A total of 3, 316 specimens were obtained from patients upon admission, once weekly during hospitalization, at discharge from the ICU, at discharge from the hospital, and 1 and 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Five colonies per specimen were selected for identification and susceptibility testing. In both patient populations, the gram-negative colonization rates in oropharyngeal specimens increased during hospitalization and did not decrease in the 3 months after discharge. In rectal specimens, colonization rates decreased during hospitalization and increased after discharge. There was a change in species distribution among the dominant <b>microfloras</b> during hospitalization. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated more often, whereas the frequency of Escherichia coli declined. The percentage of ICU patients colonized with ampicillin- and/or cephalothin-resistant fecal E. coli was significantly increased at discharge from the hospital and did not change in the 3 months after discharge. The emergence of multidrug resistance was observed for E. coli during patient stays in the ICU. Resistance frequencies in E. coli significantly increased with the length of stay in the ICU. For the general ward population, no significant changes in resistance frequencies were found during hospitalization. From a population perspective, the risk of dissemination of resistant gram-negative bacteria into the community through hospitalized patients appears to be low for general ward patients but is noticeably higher among ICU patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a palynological study on late Llandovery-Wenlock (mid-Silurian) {{successions}} in the North Esk, Bavelaw Castle and Loganlee inliers of the Pentland Hills, Midland Valley of Scotland, are documented. Palynological assemblages from the Reservoir Formation are dominated by acritarchs, but chitinozoa, cryptospores and scolecodonts are also present. Assemblages from {{the lower part of}} the Reservoir Formation are of low diversity and abundance, but marked increases in both abundance and diversity, particularly of the acritarchs, occur in the upper 200 [*]m or so of the formation. The reasons for the marked increases are unclear, but could reflect changing environmental conditions during deposition of the upper Reservoir Formation, with the marine palynomorphs tracking changes in the location of certain physical and chemical properties of water-masses, for example nutrient availability, salinity or temperature. There is a general decline in the abundance and diversity of acritarchs and chitinozoans above the Reservoir Formation, although both groups, together with rare cryptospores, are present in samples from the Deerhope and Wether Law Linn formations. The Henshaw Formation yielded few marine microfossils, but more abundant and diverse spores and cyptospores than the underlying formations, consistent with an upward transition from marine to prograding terrestrial facies. The <b>microfloras</b> from the Reservoir, Deerhope and Wether Law Linn formations are consistent with the late Llandovery age indicated by graptolite evidence. A feature of assemblages from the Reservoir Formation, particularly the more productive samples from the upper part of the formation, is the common occurrence of sphaeromorph acritarchs, Moyeria cabottii and Tylotopalla species. The common occurrence of these forms gives the palynological assemblages a distinctive character. Similar sphaeromorph-Moyeria-Tylotopalla dominated acritarch <b>microfloras</b> occur at about the same level (spiralis Graptolite Biozone) in the Silurian succession of the Girvan Inlier, in the Drumyork Flags Formation.

Sprouts were sonicated for 7 min or hand shaken with glass beads for 2 min to recover native <b>microfloras</b> from the surface, and the resulting suspensions were diluted and plated. The culturable fraction was characterized by the density (log CFU/g), richness (e. g., number of types of bacteria), and diversity (e. g., microbial richness and evenness) of colonies on tryptic soy agar plates incubated for 48 h at 30 degrees C. The relative similarity between sprout-associated microbial communities was assessed {{with the use of}} community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) based on patterns of utilization of 95 separate carbon sources. Aerobic plate counts of 7. 96 +/- 0. 91 log CFU/g of sprout tissue (fresh weight) were observed, with no statistically significant differences in microbial cell density, richness, or diversity due to sprout type, sprout-growing facility, or seed lot. CLPP analyses revealed that the microbial communities associated with alfalfa and clover sprouts are more similar than those associated with the other sprout types tested. Variability among sprout types was more extensive than any differences between microbial communities associated with alfalfa and clover sprouts from different sprout-growing facilities and seed lots. These results indicate that the subsequent testing of biocontrol agents should focus on similar organisms for alfalfa and clover, but alternative types may be most suitable for the other sprout types tested. The inoculation of alfalfa sprouts with communities derived from various sprout types had a significant, source-independent effect on microbial community structure, indicating that the process of inoculation alters the dynamics of community development regardless of the types of organisms involved...|$|R

25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural <b>microflora</b> on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.|$|E
25|$|In one study, H2S {{concentration}} {{was shown}} to correlate convincingly with perceived bad smell of flatus, followed by MM and DMS. This {{is supported by the}} fact that H2S may be the most abundant VSC present. These results were generated from subjects who were eating a diet high in pinto beans to stimulate flatus production. Others report that MM was the greatest contributor to the smell of flatus in patients not under any specific dietary alterations. It has now been demonstrated that MM, DMS and H2S (described as decomposing vegetables, unpleasantly sweet/wild radish and rotten eggs respectively) are all present in human flatus in concentrations above their smell perception thresholds. It is known that increased dietary sulfur-containing amino acids significantly increases the smell of flatus. It is therefore likely that the smell of flatus is created by a combination of VSC, with minimal contribution from non-sulfur volatiles. Such smell can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of <b>microflora</b> bacteria or the presence of faeces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur-containing amino acids, have been demonstrated to significantly increase the smell of flatus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Results of {{mycological}} {{surveys of}} root-knot and cyst nematodes from tropical regions indicate that most fungal species associated with females or cysts of species of Globodera, Heterodera, and Meloidogyne are those found with nematodes from temperate areas.

40|$|The Main Karoo Basin of South Africa {{is renowned}} for its {{exceptional}} palaeontological record and while its vertebrate fossils have been extensively researched, Karoo floras have received considerably less attention. Poor yields of palynomorphs from the Beaufort and “Stormberg” groups have complicated the task of erecting a comprehensive palynozonation scheme for the Karoo Supergroup. For this study, 65 palynologically productive samples from the Dwyka, Ecca, Beaufort and “Stormberg” groups allowed for systematic descriptions of all palynomorphs, {{as well as the}} ranges of the different taxa through the entire Karoo stratigraphic succession. Taxa with restricted ranges are useful for biostratigraphic correlation and these palynomorphs were used to delineate microfloral zones for the Karoo basin. The Dwyka Group contains high numbers of acritarchs and is generally low in species diversity. Useful biostratigraphic taxa for the Ecca Group include Cannanoropollis, Hamiapollenites, Platysaccus and Striatopodocarpites. Aratrisporites is a marker for the Latest Permian / Early Triassic Beaufort Group, while Cyathidites, Dictyophyllidites, Equisetosporites and Uvaesporites are indicators of the Late Triassic / Early Jurassic “Stormberg” Group. Palynostratigraphic zones correlate largely with the Karoo vertebrate biozones and severe and sudden extinction events are recognised among Karoo palynomorphs in the upper Tapinocephalus and Dicynodon assemblage zones. The first comprehensive palynological biozonation scheme for the Main Karoo Basin is proposed and the study provides a broad overview of Gondwanan Carboniferous - Jurassic floras. This study demonstrates that palynology is useful in correlating age equivalent lithostratigraphic units in the proximal and distal sectors of the Karoo Basin. <b>Microfloras</b> from previous South African studies are integrated within the proposed palynostratigraphic scheme, and palynological signatures of the various Karoo formations are shown to be consistent. Despite the constraints of floral provincialism, South African <b>microfloras</b> can be correlated to selected Gondwanan biozonations from Australia, Africa, Antarctica, New Zealand and South America.
