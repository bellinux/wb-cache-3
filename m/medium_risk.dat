5|$|Overall, Great Northern Highway {{performs}} favourably {{in terms}} of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up {{two thirds of the}} state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005–2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse, north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as <b>medium</b> <b>risk,</b> and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium-high and high risk. In 2013, Great Northern Highway received a similar rating, still higher overall than the other highways. Out of five stars, 21% was rated as one- or two-star, and 79% was rated three- or four-star, with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally less safe than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse.|$|E

The probabilities and consequences are basis to place the risks within the risk matrix. The risk severity in the example is represented by three levels: high, medium and low. These three levels are illustrated with different shades of colour. By including five or more levels, {{it is possible to}} make a clearer distinction between scenarios. To score the risk level severity, we suggest that high risks (dark colour) are given a score of three, <b>medium</b> <b>risks</b> (light colour) a score of two and low risks (no colour) a score of one. The risk severity score is used to weigh the importance and severity of the scenarios when assessing possible future outcomes.|$|R

On 25 November, a Walmart spokesman said he was [...] "so far unable to confirm that Tazreen is a supplier to Walmart nor if the document referenced in the article is in fact from Walmart"; the company subsequently terminated its relationship with Tazreen, stating that [...] "The Tazreen factory [...] was not authorized to produce merchandise for Walmart. A supplier subcontracted work to this factory without authorization and in direct violation of our policies." [...] Walmart critics claim that the company knew about unsafe conditions and blocked efforts to improve them. Documents found via email show that Walmart had subcontracted multiple clothing production orders through the Tazreen factory. According to The New York Times, Walmart {{played a significant role in}} blocking reforms to have retailers pay more for apparel in order to help Bangladesh factories improve their safety standards. Walmart director of ethical sourcing Sridevi Kalavakolanu asserted that the company would not agree to pay the higher cost, as such improvements in electrical and fire safety would be a [...] "very extensive and costly modification" [...] and that [...] "it is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} expectations of prognosis of recently diagnosed MS {{patients and their}} partners {{with a focus on}} the risk of wheelchair dependence. The three main questions in this thesis were: (1) How do recently diagnosed patients and their partners perceive the risk of wheelchair dependence? (2) How do perceptions of risk relate to psychological well-being? (3) What are the determinants of perception of prognostic risk? Before answering these key questions, the psychological burden of disease and the quality of life (QoL) of patients and partners in the early phase of MS are examined. It was demonstrated that the early period after diagnosis of MS puts a substantial emotional burden on patients and their partners. Patients and partners overestimated the short- and medium-term risks of wheelchair dependence, but underestimated the lifetime risk. Moreover, higher perceptions of the short- and <b>medium</b> <b>risks</b> were found among patients with higher symptom perception, and were associated with poorer psychological well-being. These findings are interpreted from a psychological and clinical perspective...|$|R
