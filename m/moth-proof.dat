50|$|During World War II, Japan {{stopped using}} {{supplies}} {{made out of}} silk, and so the United States had difficulty importing silk from Japan. Eventually, the U.S was unable to import any silk. So, Du Pont thought of an idea to convince the army that nylon {{is a much more}} effective material than silk. Du Pont was able to convince the army, and nylon fabric became increasingly popular because of its elasticity and shrink-proof, <b>moth-proof</b> material.|$|E

50|$|ServiceMaster {{was founded}} by Marion E. Wade, a minor league {{baseball}} player, as a <b>moth-proofing</b> company in Chicago, Illinois. It was incorporated in 1947 and expanded to franchised carpet cleaning in 1952. Its movement into business services makes it a large outsourcing company.|$|R
2500|$|The {{situation}} had not improved by the 1960s, when the Yorkshire Ouse River Board noted that industrial waste from the mining, paper making, brewing and textile industries was being dumping {{into the river}} without any treatment. Pressure from the Board and from local authorities based along the river resulted in some treatment being carried out, but by 1974 much of the river was still rated as Class E on the six-point water quality scale, which indicated it was of poor quality, with some parts rated as Class F, meaning that they grossly polluted {{with little or no}} life. Nevertheless, small pockets of fish began to appear. A small population of brown trout had survived in the upper [...] of the river, but could not proceed downstream due to dams erected for the woollen mills. <b>Moth-proofing</b> agents were released by the mills into the water, which were highly toxic to fish, and although the discharge of these chemicals ceased in 1979, when they were routed to a sewer for treatment, the problem did not immediately go away, as the chemicals continued to seep into the river from land which had been contaminated by them for another ten years. Any progress with the re-establishment of fish stocks was destroyed by a series of releases of pollutants into the river during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Mothproofing {{chemicals}} - Treatment {{of materials}} as a preventive measure before their use, {{as well as}} simply for storage, has a long history. [...] Arsenical compounds were effective in killing larvae but were considered too toxic for human contact even {{in the early twentieth}} century. Triphenyltin chloride was effective at 0.25%. After 1947, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides of many varieties were found to be effective at the low concentrations practical for preservative treatment. [...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of Aldrin and Dieldrin exempted <b>moth-proofing</b> in a closed manufacturing process. Triazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives have an anti-feeding effect on Tineola bisselliella larvae when wool is treated with these compounds. At 3% on mass of wool, both epoxiconazole and econazole nitrate protect wool fabric from Tineola bisselliella to the standard specified by Wools of New Zealand Test Method 25 (based on ISO 3998-1977(E).|$|R
