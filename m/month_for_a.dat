Alex James, despite being Arsenal's captain and having previously played for the Scottish international team, was not chosen for that match, {{which resulted in a}} 1–1 draw, enabling Scotland to win the 1936 British Home Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Raymond {{made the}} Canucks' roster out {{of training camp}} and made his NHL debut on the team's top line with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. He picked up his first NHL point, an assist, in the season-opener against the San Jose Sharks on October 5, 2007. Soon thereafter, he was sent down to the Moose for a two-day assignment after having been a healthy scratch. He returned to the Canucks on October 18, 2007, and was later returned to the Moose {{at the end of}} the <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> longer assignment.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food {{supply to the}} city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per <b>month,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Rhodes {{returned}} to League Two, {{when he signed}} a one-year deal with Rotherham United, after their manager Mark Robins was impressed by Rhodes' performance against them the previous season. Rotherham were deducted 17points {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 season because of improperly exiting administration. They started the season with a 1–0 against Lincoln City, in which Rhodes made his debut before he was substituted in the second half. He scored his first goal for Rotherham in a League Cup first round tie against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 12 August 2008. Rhodes' goal game only seconds after Wednesday had opened the scoring, before the game finished 2–2. Rotherham eventually won through to the second round on penalties. His first league goal for the club came less than two weeks later as Rotherham beat Chester City 3–1 to maintain their winning start to the season. Rhodes was a regular in the Rotherham side {{at the start of the}} season as the team overhauled their point deduction to go above Grimsby Town in the league, but he was dropped for a game against his former side Bradford City in November 2008. He briefly {{returned to}} the side the following <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Football League Trophy area semi-final with Darlington, which Rotherham won on penalties, but did not play again until the two sides met once more in a league game at the end of January 2009.|$|E

The war cost Italy 1.3 billion lire, nearly a billion more than Giolitti estimated before the war. This ruined ten years of fiscal prudence.|$|E

The annual total compensation is hence $31,800. However, total annual compensation will increase to $50,000. The mayor currently receives about $61,200; that {{will rise to}} $75,000 a year beginning with the 2018 election.

25|$|In {{addition}} to straightforward theft, Paneb also resorted to misappropriating labour {{and other resources}} for his own ends. According to Amennakht, Paneb ordered his stone workers not only to steal stone from the worksite of Seti II, but to use this stone to build columns for his personal tomb. In one case, he not only ordered his workers to make a plaited bed, but made their wives weave clothing for him. In addition, he stole several work tools, breaking one (Recto 2.13). Some tools were apparently of great value, as the workers searched for an entire <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tool he stole before he snuck it back onto the worksite.|$|E
25|$|After 7 days of loading, the {{crankshaft}} of {{the compressor}} broke, damaging the machine's casing and causing {{the loss of}} the 643 sheep stowed.

The frozen carcasses were resold locally during this time, and, encouragingly, they were considered to be indistinguishable from fresh meat. On 15 February 1882, the Dunedin sailed with 4331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 250 kegs of butter, hare, pheasant, turkey, chicken and 2226 sheep tongues. Sparks from the compressor's boiler created a fire hazard, and Captain Whitson at one point developed hypothermia while working alone in the air duct.|$|E

25|$|Upon taking office, the Mauroy Government {{embarked}} upon {{an ambitious}} redistributive programme. The minimum wage {{went up in}} real terms by 11% between May 1981 and September 1982, while the minimum old age pension was increased by 30%. 800,000 elderly people were exempted from paying T.V. licenses, while 1.5million were also exempted from local taxes. Between May 1981 and January 1983, family benefits were significantly increased, with the purchasing power of the 2,700,000 families with two children raised by 40%. These policies significantly improved the living standards of the less well off in French society, with poverty reduced during Mauroy’s term in office. Family allowances were increased by 81% for families with two children and by 49% for families with three children, while old-age pensions were raised by 300 francs a <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single person and 3,700 francs for a couple.|$|E
25|$|Belmopan {{features}} a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification. The {{city has a}} lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. As is the characteristic of several cities with a tropical monsoon climate, Belmopan sees some precipitation during its dry season. March and April are Belmopan's driest months with roughly 45mm of rainfall observed on average during those months. Like Belize City, these are somewhat unusual months for {{a city with a}} tropical monsoon climate to have its driest months of the year. Typically the driest <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> city with this climate type is the month after the winter solstice, which in Belmopan would be January.

In January 2013, eight NH90s were on firm order. On 1 August 2013, Belgium received its first NH90 NFH at Full Operational Capability (FOC). On 23 October 2013, Belgium's first NH90 TTH entered service, the last was delivered on 13 November 2014. From first delivery until the last, three NH90s flew 34 hours a <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of 450 flight hours with a 67 percent availability rate, making Belgium one of the type's most intensive users. Two NH90 NFHs for the navy were delivered, the final two were delivered by early 2015 to replace their Westland Sea King helicopters. On 21 August 2015, the Belgian Navy declared its NH90s had attained initial operational readiness; on 28 August 2015, the first rescue mission performed by a Belgian Navy NH90 took place.|$|E
