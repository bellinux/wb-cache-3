50|$|Vapor phase osmometry (VPO), {{also known}} as vapor-pressure osmometry, is an {{experimental}} technique for the determination of a polymer's number average molecular weight, Mn. It works {{by taking advantage of}} the decrease in vapor pressure that occurs when solutes are added to pure solvent. This technique can be used for polymers with a molecular weight of up to 20,000 though accuracy is best for those below 10,000. Although <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> is also based on the measurement of colligative properties, it has a lower bound of 25,000 for sample molecular weight that can be measured owing to problems with membrane permeation.|$|E

In 1927, he married the Latvian botanist, Magda Voita (also shown as (Magda Woit), who was a collaborator with him until his death and whose contributions he acknowledged in his Nobel Prize acceptance. Further evidence to support his polymer hypothesis emerged in the 1930s. High molecular weights of polymers were confirmed by <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry,</b> and also by Staudinger’s measurements of viscosity in solution. The X-ray diffraction studies of polymers by Herman Mark provided direct evidence for long chains of repeating molecular units. And the synthetic work led by Carothers demonstrated that polymers such as nylon and polyester could be prepared by well-understood organic reactions. His theory opened up the subject to further development, and helped place polymer science on a sound basis.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{absolute}} instrumental {{approach was}} also {{possible with the}} development of light scattering theory by Einstein, Raman, Debye, Zimm, and others. The problem with measurements made using <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> and sedimentation was that they only characterized the bulk properties of the polymer sample. Moreover, the measurements were excessively time consuming and prone to operator error. In order to gain information about a polydisperse mixture of molar masses, a method for separating the different sizes was developed. This was achieved by the advent of size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC is {{based on the fact that}} the pores in the packing material of chromatography columns could be made small enough for molecules to become temporarily lodged in their interstitial spaces. As the sample makes its way through a column the smaller molecules spend more time traveling in these void spaces than the larger ones, which have fewer places to [...] "wander". The result is that a sample is separated according to its hydrodynamic volume [...] As a consequence, the big molecules come out first, and then the small ones follow in the elutent. By choosing a suitable column packing material it is possible to define the resolution of the system. Columns can also be combined in series to increase resolution or the range of sizes studied.|$|E

Molecular recognition experiments clearly pointed out the presence of functionalized cavities within the microgels that were able to recognize and to selectively bind sugar molecules. The experiment can be carried out in homogeneous solution, after which the microgels are conveniently separated by ultracentrifugation. Although the obtained selectivities are still low compared to the results achieved with insoluble crosslinked polymers, the success of this approach represents an important step towards the development of what might be properly described as "artificial enzymes"...|$|E
40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> is used {{to measure}} osmotic {{pressures}} of dilute solutions containing quasispherical CdSe nanocrystals covered with polymer brushes in toluene in the range 31 - 45 °C. Osmotic-pressure data, {{as a function of}} nanocrystal concentration, yield the molecular weight and the osmotic second virial coefficient of the nanocrystals; the latter is related to the potential of mean force between two nanocrystal particles in dilute solution. Coupled with molecular-weight data, extinction coefficients and oscillator strengths are also obtained for nanocrystals of various sizes in toluene. CdSe nanocrystal sizes were obtained either from transmission electron microscopy or from correlations between the wavelength of the absorbing peak and nanocrystal size. Osmotic-pressure data are reduced with a simple perturbed-hard-sphere equation of state; the perturbation is due to long-range (London dispersion) attraction and a short-range interaction potential.

40|$|A virial {{theory was}} used to relate {{molecular}} interactions (in terms of second virial coefficients, B') and molecular size ratios to liquid–liquid phase separation. Application of the virial theory to binary hard sphere mixtures (additive and non-additive) confirmed the applicability of this simple approach towards predicting phase behavior based on two-particle interactions. Experimentally, second cross virial coefficients were obtained for dextran/gelatin, whey protein isolate (WPI) /gelatin mixtures and whey protein aggregate (WPA) /gelatin mixtures using <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> at varying ionic strength. From this, solvent conditions where interactions between proteins are dominated by electrostatics and solvent conditions where interactions are dominated by hard body interactions could be determined. Using experimentally obtained second virial coefficients, the liquid–liquid phase separation for gelatin/dextran mixtures was successfully predicted. Second cross virial coefficients for gelatin/whey protein isolate and for gelatin/whey protein aggregate {{could be related to}} the absence of phase separation in these mixtures.

We also found that a significant isotope effect exists in the TGIC retention between deuterated and hydrogenous polymers. In our case, where the H-polymer is partially deuterated, the TGIC analysis enabled us to resolve all the side products.

The block copolymers were synthesized successfully with either poly(2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate) or poly(n-butyl acrylate) macro-RAFT agents.

Polyacrylamides have been synthesised by a solution polymerisation process using water as the solvent. The radical polymerisation performed under a nitrogen blanket was initiated by the thermal decomposition of potassium persulphate. The influence of monomer and initiator concentrations, temperature and reaction time on the polymerisation conversion of monomer into polymer and on polymer molecular weight has been investigated.

A range of copolymers has been synthesised with extended siloxane segments where the substituents on the silicon atoms are both methyl groups. Two methods of polymerization have been employed with comparable success. These are the condensation between p-phenylenebis(dimethylsilanol) and tetramethyldisiloxanediol catalysed by TMG and the KOH catalysed polymerization of p-phenylenebis(dimethylsilanol) and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.

40|$|A new oxidised-alginate / N-succinyl-chitosan {{hydrogel}} {{system with}} potential biomedical applications has been explored for precursor solution viscosities within the injectable range (<~ 0. 2 Pa·s). When fully developed, its advantages may include: 1) good mechanical properties due to covalent crosslinking; 2) increased degrees-of-freedom to tailor properties and unique stress strain response {{due to the}} hybrid structure; 3) suitability for cell encapsulation / use as an injectable gel due to biocompatibility / mild formation conditions; and 4) excellent adoptability due to readily available and low cost raw ingredients. The current work is focused on two initial studies of the system: 1) development of hybrid hydrogel compositions to meet target viscosity and stiffness ranges that are appropriate for common hydrogel applications, and 2) development and validation of models to predict hydrogel swelling and stiffness behaviour. As gel systems become more complex, predictive tools are crucial for more focused development work so that end users can tailor gel systems to their precise requirements. In this work, we have undertaken the development and/or advancement of three predictive models: 1) advancing current swelling models to apply to hybrid systems containing polyampholytes; 2) refining <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> models to handle polyampholytes and to incorporate modern corrections for non-ideal solutions; and 3) proposing a new stiffness model for hybrid gel systems. These models were verified using a comprehensive experimental program for which new experimental equipment was custom-designed and built. To form the new gels, limit-oxidized alginate (~ 45 % repeat units modified) and six N-succinyl-chitosans (22 to 52 % primary amine substitution) were synthesized from commercially available polymer. Solutions were prepared using phosphate buffered saline. A viscosity guideline of (<~ 0. 2 Pa·s) {{was obtained from the}} injectability literature. This was easily met by oxidized-alginate solutions. N-succinyl-chitosan was limited to five substitutions (22 to 48 %), with respective concentrations between 4. 8 and 2. 0 w/w%. Gels were formed by blending alginate and chitosan solutions at five different ratios (2 : 1 to 1 : 9). Gel stiffness was characterized in the 'as cast' state by compression testing. Swelling was characterized in phosphate buffered saline. Our results showed that the stiffness model provided a good fit (largest p-value < 0. 03). From the model it was found that limit-oxidized-alginate is 16 times less stiff than N-succinyl-chitosan. This combined with the restricted injectable concentration range resulted in a maximum stiffness of 7 kPA, which is below the target window for muscle tissue (i. e. between 10 to 30 kPa). To simultaneously achieve both targets further investigation is recommended using higher concentrations of lower molecular weight chitosan or stiffer oxidized polysaccharides. For N-succinyl-chitosan, the <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> model gave an excellent fit (largest p-value ~ 10 ⁻⁷). A key finding was that the Manning-Oosawa model for ion condensation does not accurately predict behaviour. The relatively fast rate of oxidized-alginate degradation prevented osmometry from being used to collect empirical ion condensation data. Without this data, classical swelling theory could not adequately predict experimental response. In future work, conductivity experiments are recommended to characterize ion condensation. Recent models by Trizac and O'Shaughnessy are recommended as improvements to the swelling theory. The primary scientific contributions from this work are: 1) the first systematic characterization of the stiffness and swelling of injectable oxidised-alginate / N-succinyl-chitosan hydrogels; 2) the first analysis of polyampholyte ion condensation by <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry</b> since the advent of modern ion activity models in the early 1990 's; 3) the aforementioned advancement of osmometry and swelling theory; and 4) the proposal and successful experimental verification of a new model for hybrid gel stiffness. In addition, a number of other contributions were also made, mainly: 1) a membrane osmometer was designed and built to characterize small samples of polyelectrolytes at elevated temperature and in concentrated chloride solutions, 2) N-succinylation was found to fit a log-linear empirical correlation with respect to input reagent concentrations; 3) a small increase in chitosan moisture affinity and thermal stability was observed with increasing N-succinyl substitution; 4) anomalous phase separation and rheological behaviour was observed in N-succinyl-chitosan solutions near the solubility limit; and 5) polyampholyte solution rheology was found to scale differently than that of polyelectrolytes. Although the stiffness is below what was anticipated, the oxidised-alginate / N-succinyl-chitosan hydrogel system shows good potential. Provided the stiffness limitation can be overcome, the existence of high strain 'secondary stiffness' behaviour provides the potential for a much closer match to the non-linear elastic response of muscle tissue than is currently possible with single component systems. In addition, interesting phase behaviour near the N-succinyl-chitosan solubility limit may allow independent control of pore size and stiffness via a heterogeneous structure...|$|E

Styryl-terminated polystyrene macromonomers have been synthesised by the anionic polymerisation of styrene. Initiation was by sec-butyl lithium; termination involved the addition of diphenylethylene prior to vinyl benzyl chloride. Characterisation of the macromonomers was performed using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr). Novel comb graft copolymers were synthesised by the copolymerisation of the macromonomer with a comonomer. The following comonomers were used: Z-vinylpyridine (Z-VP), 4 - vinylpyridine (4 -VP) and N-(vinylbenzyl) pyrrolidone (VBP). Graft copolymers were made {{with a range of}} compositions by varying the feed ratios of the comonomer to the macromonomer. Reactivity ratios were determined for the different graft copolymer systems and compared to the simple statistical copolymerisation of styrene with comonomer. Characterisation of the graft copolymers was performed using GPC, nmr and <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry.</b> Micellar dispersions of the comb graft copolymers were prepared in cyclohexane, toluene and methanol.

Since conventional methods of characterization cannot separate completely the cyclic copolymer from its linear precursor, {{differences in the}} micellar behavior were used as a method for investigation of their purity. For this purpose, {{in addition to the}} cyclic and linear triblock copolymers, two linear diblocks with similar compositions, and molecular weight equal or half of the cyclic diblocks, were also synthesized. The synthetic approach of the cyclics involved the reaction of (1, 3 -phenylene) bis(3 -methyl- 1 -phenylpentylidene) dilithium initiator with butadiene in the presence of sec-BuOLi, followed by polymerization of St (or St-d 8). The cyclization of the resulting a,co-difunctional triblock copolymer was performed by using bis(dimethylchlorosilyl) ethane, under high dilution conditions.

Moreover, the SANS data for the triblocks in n-decane indicated the presence of 37 % dangling chains which did not appear in the data for the corresponding cyclic copolymers.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} that polymers {{could be made}} electrically conductive {{by the use of}} oxidative-reductive compounds opened a new area of solid state physics. Until poly (p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS) was demonstrated to be among those polymers which formed these highly conductive complexes, the polymers of interest in this area were not solution or melt processible. The introduction of processible PPS allowed the characterization of the polymer prior to exposure to the electron-transfer species. Samples of PPS and Poly (2 -methyl p-phenylene sulfide) (PMPS) were synthesized from the corresponding copper p-bromothiophenoxides.

Progress of the AsF(, 5) reaction was followed using differential heat of reaction. ^ The results and conclusions indicate that the crystalline character of the polymer as well as the packing of the powders, has a strong influence on the rate of doping. Rapid weight uptakes were recorded for the more amorphous, loosely packed sample than the more crystalline polymers. Correlation with similar tests using polyacetylene, poly (p-phenylene) and graphite support this observation. The conductivity values measured by four-probe techniques were commensurate with those reported in literature. Values for the mass crystalline PPS samples were on the order of 10 to 100 times greater than for the amorphous PPS and PMPS powders. ^ Preliminary results with the AlCl(, 3) compound and Cl(, 2) co-reagent showed degradation of the polymer and migration of sulfur to the pressed pellet surfaces. Use of HCl as a co-reagent increased the conductivity of the PPS pressed pellets over 10 orders of magnitude. Inhomogeneity of the reaction for the sample cross-section precluded the determination of an exact value. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of chiral biopolymer systems involves both intra- and inter-molecular interactions. The {{contribution of}} these forces to protein hydration and stability and {{their influence on}} DNA chiral interactions is investigated. The osmotic stress technique is utilized to vary water activity in solution through {{the addition of a}} neutral osmolyte, such as poly(ethylene glycol). ^ For the osmotic stress experiments, the osmotic pressure of the stressing solutions and its temperature dependence is needed. Since traditional methods, such as vapor pressure osmometry, static light scattering, and <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry,</b> are not suitable for the concentration and temperature range of interest, a new method is devised using sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. We are using this method to measure the osmotic pressure of aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) solutions over a concentration range of 0 to 50 wt% and over a temperature range of 10 to 40 °C. ^ Hydration changes accompanying protein folding are investigated using the helix-coil transition in poly(glutamic acid) as a model system. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry is used to follow this transition as a function of osmotic pressure, temperature, and pH. The energetics of the helix-coil transition allow the number of water molecules associated with the conformational change to be calculated. We find that osmotic pressure raises the helix-coil transition temperature by favoring the more compact α-helical state over the more hydrated coil state. ^ To provide a better understanding of chiral interactions between biopolymers, measurements of short fragment (146 bp) DNA cholesteric pitch and twist angle are made as a function of DNA interaxial spacing and salt concentration. The cholesteric pitch and DNA interaxial spacing are followed by polarizing optical microscopy and X-ray scattering, respectively, and the microscopic twist angle between DNA molecules then can be calculated. Increasing ionic strength results in enhanced chiral interactions as evidenced by the increase in twist angle for a fixed interaxial spacing. In addition, we have created hybrid liquid crystals of short fragment DNA and elastin-like peptides that exhibit a cholesteric phase structure and undergo thermal contraction upon heating. These liquid crystalline systems are useful in studying chiral interactions between biopolymers and potentially could be utilized as biosensors. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} weight on {{pressure sensitive adhesive}} properties was studied in a model system of commercial polyisobutylenes having a range of {{number average molecular weight}} 25, 000 to 750, 000. High and low molecular weight samples were blended to artificially create two series of broad distribution samples with polydispersities of 4 to 11. Characterization was done by size exclusion chromatography and <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry.</b> ^ Adhesive performance was assessed for each homopolymer and blend by shear, peel and probe tack testing based on standardized test methods. In the homopolymer series, with an increase in molecular weight, 180 (DEGREES) peel and probe tack decrease to a constant level. Resistance to shear (or creep) passes through a maximum at a number average of 300, 000. While the broad distribution blends generally showed slight improvement over the homopolymer with similar number and weight average molecular weight, there was no conclusive evidence to suggest a relationship with increasing polydispersity. ^ Rheological properties were determined for the homopolymers and blends as a function of frequency. Established trends for molecular weight and frequency were observed in the homopolymer series. Among the blends, little difference in rheological properties was found. ^ The adhesive performance for the homopolymers and blends was linked with the rheological properties of the sample. Each adhesive test was modeled so that a rate of deformation could be calculated for comparison to rheological properties at similar frequencies. In probe tack testing, the ability of the sample to establish contact with the test surface is related to the tensile creep compliance at a time corresponding to probe dwell time. Tack values increase with increasing compliance. Once a sample has wet a surface, its ability to resist subsequent deformation was found to depend on the dissipation factor (G 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 /G 2 ̆ 7) in the homopolymer series. With increasing dissipation factor, there is increased peel and probe tack. The magnitude of the increase is test rate dependent. Resistance to shear (creep) increases sharply with an increase in complex viscosity. The lack of variation in rheological properties and adhesive performance of the blends made it impossible to make any positive conclusions regarding the influence of molecular weight distribution. ...|$|E
40|$|As polysiloxanes combine unique {{physical}} and chemical properties they have found nowadays wide scientific and technological interest. The most well studied member of this class of materials is poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). As a result of its excellent thermal and oxidative stability, low absorption in UV, and good oxygen reactive ion etch resistance, PDMS is widely used in lithographic applications for microelectronics. In addition, PDMS shows high chain flexibility, low glass transition temperature, low surface energy, and low solubility parameter. These properties render PDMS-based materials very attractive in a variety of industrial areas. Therefore, the synthesis of well defined homo- and copolymers of dimethylsiloxane with different architectures is of major importance for designing new materials. Until now, anionic polymerization high vacuum techniques combined with appropriate linking chemistry have been the most powerful tool for synthesizing polymers of complex macromolecular architectures. Unfortunately, anionic polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D 3), the usual monomer of PDMS, suffers from backbiting reactions, thus rendering the synthesis of PDMS copolymers with complex macromolecular architectures difficult or even impossible. Recently our group solved this problem, by a two-step protocol for the complete polymerization of D 3 without side reactions. In this study, a series of novel three-arm A 2 B, A 2 C, and four-arm A 2 D 2 miktoarm star polymers, as well as a series of H-shaped A 2 BD 2 copolymers, where A is poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), B is polybutadiene (PBd), C is a linear triblock terpolymer PS-b-PI-b-P 2 VP and D is polystyrene (PS), where successfully synthesized via anionic polymerization techniques and the combination of chlorosilane and benzyl chloride linking chemistry. This new and general methodology is based on the linking reaction of in-chain benzyl chloride functionalized poly(dimethylsiloxane) {BzCl-(PDMS) 2 } with the living centers of PBd-DPH-Li+ or PS-b-PI-b-P 2 VP-Li+ or (PS) 2 -DPH-Li+ or (PS) 2 PBd-DPH-Li+. The precursor BzCl-(PDMS) 2 of the already mentioned architectures was synthesized by the selective reaction of lithium PDMS enolate with the chlorosilane group of dichloro[4 -(chloromethyl) phenylethyl](methyl) silane (CMPEMDS), leaving the benzyl chloride group intact. The combined molecular characterization results of size exclusion chromatography, <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry,</b> 1 H NMR and two-angle laser light scattering, revealed high degree of structural and compositional homogeneity in all, intermediate and final, products. Differential scanning calorimetry was also used in order to study the thermal behaviour of A 2 D 2 miktoarm stars and A 2 BD 2 H-shaped copolymers. Finally, the micellization properties of the H-shaped copolymers were studied in terms of dynamic and static light scattering in methylethylketone, leading to monomolecular micelles or micelles with degree of association 2. ...|$|E
40|$|Evolution of {{incipient}} nephropathy in {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus. BackgroundWe {{examined the}} course of glomerular injury in 12 Pima Indians with long-standing (> 8 years) type 2 diabetes mellitus, normal serum creatinine, and microalbuminuria. They were compared {{with a group of}} 10 Pima Indians in Arizona with new-onset (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes, normal renal function, and normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg albumin/g creatinine on random urine specimens). MethodsA combination of physiological and morphological techniques was used to evaluate glomerular function and structure serially on two occasions separated by a 48 -month interval. Clearances of iothalamate and p-aminohippuric acid were used to determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow, respectively. Afferent oncotic pressure was determined by <b>membrane</b> <b>osmometry.</b> The single nephron ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) was determined by morphometric analysis of glomeruli and mathematical modeling. ResultsThe urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (median + range) increased from 84 (28 to 415) to 260 (31 to 2232) mg/g between the two examinations (P = 0. 01), and 6 of 12 patients advanced from incipient (ratio = 30 to 299 mg/g) to overt nephropathy (≥ 300 mg/g). A 17 % decline in GFR between the two examinations from 186 ± 41 to 155 ± 50 mL/min (mean ± SD; P = 0. 06) was accompanied by a 17 % decline in renal plasma flow (P = 0. 003) and a 6 % increase in plasma oncotic pressure (P = 0. 02). Computed glomerular hydraulic permeability was depressed by 13 % below control values at both examinations, a result of a widened basement membrane and a reduction in frequency of epithelial filtration slits. The filtration surface area declined significantly, however, from 6. 96 ± 2. 53 to 5. 51 ± 1. 62 × 105 mm 2 (P = 0. 01), a change that was accompanied by a significant {{decline in the number of}} mesangial cells (P = 0. 001), endothelial cells (P = 0. 038), and podocytes (P = 0. 0005). These changes lowered single nephron Kf by 20 % from 16. 5 ± 6. 0 to 13. 2 ± 3. 6 nL/(minutes + mm Hg) between the two examinations (P = 0. 02). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that among the determinants of GFR, only the change in single nephron Kf was related to the corresponding change in GFR. ConclusionWe conclude that a reduction in Kf is the major determinant of a decline in GFR from an elevated toward a normal range as nephropathy in type 2 diabetes advances from an incipient to an overt stage...|$|E
