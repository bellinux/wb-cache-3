5|$|Already {{during the}} later {{stages of the}} war, when the Commonwealth army moved from Smolensk to Bely, a new threat begun to loom on the {{southern}} borders, where the Ottoman Empire was <b>massing</b> an invasion force. Thus Władysław began redirecting his reinforcements to that theater. Later that year, the Commonwealth forces under Stanisław Koniecpolski scored {{a victory in the}} south, ending a war against the Ottomans.|$|E

He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama and he intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted {{to move out}} of the air base and link up with troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area. A military spokesman said that {{government forces}} were <b>massing</b> in Samarra and would soon make another push to capture Tikrit. Meanwhile, south of Tikrit, the army managed to recapture the town of Mukayshifah in fighting that an army spokesman claimed killed 40 ISIS fighters.|$|E
50|$|In <b>mass</b> {{spectrometry}} of peptides and proteins, {{knowledge of}} the <b>masses</b> of the residues is useful. The <b>mass</b> of the peptide or protein {{is the sum of}} the residue <b>masses</b> plus the <b>mass</b> of water (Monoisotopic <b>mass</b> = 18.01056 Da; average <b>mass</b> = 18.0153 Da). The residue <b>masses</b> are calculated from the tabulated chemical formulas and atomic weights. In <b>mass</b> spectrometry, ions may also include one or more protons (Monoisotopic <b>mass</b> = 1.00728 Da; average <b>mass</b> = 1.0074 Da).|$|R

5|$|On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres {{began and}} the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority {{operations}} to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units {{to operate with}} relative freedom. The Germans had adopted a defensive stratagem of <b>massing</b> their aircraft, now increasingly outnumbered, at critical points of the front. Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had begun}} <b>massing</b> troops near the Soviet border {{even before the}} {{campaign}} in the Balkans had finished. By {{the third week of}} February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional Luftwaffe operations included numerous aerial surveillance missions over Soviet territory many months before the attack.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple <b>massing</b> and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mass</b> number {{gives an}} {{estimate}} of the isotopic <b>mass</b> measured in atomic <b>mass</b> units (u). For 12C the isotopic <b>mass</b> is exactly 12, since the atomic <b>mass</b> unit is defined as 1/12 of the <b>mass</b> of 12C. For other isotopes, the isotopic <b>mass</b> is usually within 0.1 u of the <b>mass</b> number. For example, 35Cl (17 protons and 18 neutrons) has a <b>mass</b> number of 35 and an isotopic <b>mass</b> of 34.96885.|$|R

5|$|When {{faced with}} opponents who used {{unfamiliar}} fighting techniques, {{such as in}} Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while <b>massing</b> his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{situation}} in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning {{to take advantage of}} the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, <b>massing</b> forces on the Soviet border.|$|E
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and <b>massing</b> that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} body composition on bone <b>mass</b> in children and adolescents. MethodsA cross-sectional study with 267 healthy students of both sexes (141 males and 126 females) aged 8 to 18 years. Weight, height, body <b>mass</b> index, lean <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass</b> index, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-to-hip ratio were evaluated. Bone <b>mass</b> was assessed using ultrasound of hand phalanges (DBM Sonic BP – IGEA, Carpi, Italy). ResultsFemales showed greater bone <b>mass</b> in relation to males with advances in age and pubertal stage. In both sexes, the bone <b>mass</b> showed significant and positive correlations with age, weight, height, body <b>mass</b> index, lean <b>mass,</b> waist and hip circumferences; and negative correlations with waist-to-hip ratio. In females, {{there was also a}} positive correlation with fat <b>mass,</b> fat <b>mass</b> index, and body fat percentage. Age and lean <b>mass</b> were predictors for bone <b>mass</b> in males, and age, pubertal stage and fat <b>mass</b> index were predictors in females.

5|$|In 1967, {{just before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed, falsely, that Israeli troops were <b>massing</b> along the Syrian border. That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan's Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael <b>Massing</b> {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across as less than a neutral presentation.|$|E
5|$|In late September {{and early}} October, Wark {{commanded}} {{a company in}} the Ypres sector of Belgium during the Battle of Polygon Wood. On 29 September—the {{first day of the}} battle—Wark's men successfully repelled the leading waves of a German counter-attack and, with artillery support, drove off the remainder. Over the following three days, his constant patrolling and personal reconnaissance of the German positions enabled him to ascertain when they were <b>massing</b> for further counter-attacks; on one occasion he dispersed the assembling German troops with rifle fire and grenades. For his actions during the battle, Wark was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the details of which were published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 3 June 1918.|$|E

5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was <b>massing</b> around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway, Operation Weserübung, began on 9 April 1940. In {{order to prevent}} any disruption of the invasion by the British, the Kriegsmarine had previously dispatched a force under Vice Admiral Günther Lütjens to protect the troop convoy landing at Narvik. The German squadron consisted of the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the heavy cruiser , and 10 destroyers. With intelligence suggesting that the Germans were <b>massing</b> ships, the British sent out a squadron under Admiral Sir William Whitworth to deny German access to neutral Norwegian waters by laying mines in Operation Wilfred and prevent any German naval movements into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were <b>massing</b> to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence given the lack of any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} derived <b>mass</b> relation {{has been}} extended to seven equidistant fundamental <b>masses</b> covering an extremely large <b>mass</b> range from ~ 10 - 69 kg to ~ 1053 kg.
