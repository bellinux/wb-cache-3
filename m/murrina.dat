5000|$|For {{the next}} 25 years Tagliapietra worked in {{association}} with several of Murano's most important glass factories, including Vetreria Galliano Ferro, Venini & C., La <b>Murrina,</b> Effetre International, where he was Artistic and Technical Director from 1976 to 1989, and EOS Design nel Vetro. At <b>Murrina</b> he developed his [...] "Saturn" [...] design, which became his [...] "personal emblem". His influence on the American art glass studio movement is primarily attributed to his colleague Dale Chihuly. In 1968 Chihuly visited Murano, where he gave Tagliapietra studio time to develop his own pieces. He taught Tagliapietra his techniques, which Tagliapietra taught to other glass maestri, including Pino Signoretto, and Taglipietra taught Chihuly the Venetians' secrets in turn. A 2001 film documents this collaboration: Chihuly and the Masters of Venice.|$|E

50|$|In South America, surra {{was known}} by the names mal de caderas (hip illness), <b>murrina,</b> peste boba, derrengadera, and Panama horse disease. Mal de caderas was {{sometimes}} used for rabies as well, but most commonly refers to surra. Mal de caderas spread from Brazil to eastern Bolivia in the 1840s. Because so many horses sickened and died from surra, people in eastern Bolivia {{from this point on}} were occasionally known to ride oxen, which became known as bueyes caballos (horse oxen) or bueyes de cabalgadura (riding oxen).|$|E
