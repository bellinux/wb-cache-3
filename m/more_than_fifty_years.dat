He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E

Over {{the course}} of a <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>year</b> artistic career he created in excess of 225 sculptures.

Despite their diminutive size, his works were detailed, such as monkeys with facial expressions, fingers and toes.|$|R

5|$|No African American {{was awarded}} a Medal of Honor either during World War II or {{immediately}} afterwards {{with respect to their}} actions during that conflict. This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended that several of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> {{after the end of the}} war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{investors are}} {{compensated}} for taking on commonality risk in equity portfolios. A large literature documents {{the existence and}} the causes of commonality in illiquidity, but the implications for investors are less well understood. In a <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>year</b> long sample of NYSE stocks, we find that commonality risk carries a return premium of around 2. 6 per cent annually. The commonality risk premium is statistically and economically significant, and substantially higher than what is found in previous studies. It is robust when controlling for illiquidity level effects, different investment horizons, as well as variations in illiquidity measurement and systematic illiquidity estimation...|$|R

40|$|Recently some pessimism {{has been}} {{expressed}} about {{our lack of}} progress in understanding quasars over <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>year</b> since their discovery. It is worthwhile {{to look back at}} some of the progress that has been made – but still lies under the radar – perhaps because few people are working on optical/UV spectroscopy in this field. Great advances in understanding quasar phenomenology have emerged using eigenvector techniques. The 4 D eigenvector 1 context provides a surrogate H-R Diagram for quasars with a source main sequence driven by Eddington ratio convolved with line-of-sight orientation. Appreciating the striking differences between quasars at opposite ends of the main sequence (so-called population A and B sources) opens the door towards a unified model of quasar physics, geometry and kinematics. We present a review of some of the progress that has been made over the past 15 years, and point out unsolved issues...|$|R
5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Cholas, Tiruchirappalli was conquered by the Pandyas, who ruled from 1216 until their defeat in 1311 by Malik Kafur, the {{commander}} of Allauddin Khilji.

Gradually, the Vijayanagar Empire established supremacy over the northern parts of the kingdom, and Tiruchirappalli was taken by the Vijayanagar prince Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar in 1371. The Vijayanagar Empire ruled the region from 1378 until the 1530s, and played a prominent role in reviving Hinduism by reconstructing temples and monuments destroyed by the previous Muslim rulers. Following the collapse of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early part of the 16th century, the Madurai Nayak kingdom began to assert its independence. The city flourished during the reign of Vishwanatha Nayak (c. 1529–1564), who is said to have protected the area by constructing the Teppakulam and building walls around the Srirangam temple. His successor Kumara Krishnappa Nayaka made Tiruchirappalli his capital, and it served as the capital of the Madurai Nayak kingdom from 1616 to 1634 and from 1665 to 1736.|$|E
