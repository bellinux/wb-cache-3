Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and motion capture performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked on Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM {{to be used by}} all vendors, which showed the outline of his body – an element from the comics. Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "It's like a little time echo. As Ant-Man shrinks in almost a stop <b>motion</b> <b>way</b> he would leave behind outlines of the poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline." ...|$|E

For {{the poor}} degree of {{stability}} and limitation of shooting dexterity of existing stop-motion shooting machine, the overall structure of a new stop-motion shooting robot is developed. Based on the analysis on the shooting requirement, the lens motion space and <b>motion</b> <b>way</b> of the robot are set up, and the structure sketch is proposed. The distance between the adjacent joints is obtained according to the robot kinematics analysis by means of D-H method, and overall design of the robot is established. A new wire-drive device is proposed to improve flexibility of the motion part, and is applied to drive holder. Comparing with existing stop-motion shooting machine, the robot has high stability and good flexibility. The overall design may also play a fundamental part in further detail design of the articulated stop-motion shooting robot...|$|E

However, heritage corridor is seen as one landscape with heritage preservation value and closely bound up with human activities and social conversations which related to the heritage corridor. In this paper, taking the region of Nanjing Qinhuai River from Shuixi Gate to Hanzhong Gate as an example, we divided the evaluation system into two aspects, elements of landscape and ways of observation, to discuss the interaction and relationship between the visual experiences of different human activities and the landscape quality of heritage corridor.
