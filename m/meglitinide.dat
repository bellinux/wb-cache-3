40|$|Hypoglycaemia-inducing sulphonylureas, such as glibenclamide, inhibit cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels. In search of modulators of CFTR, we investigated {{the effects of}} the non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents <b>meglitinide,</b> repaglinide, and mitiglinide (KAD- 1229) on CFTR Cl− channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from C 127 cells expressing wild-type human CFTR. When added to the intracellular solution, <b>meglitinide</b> and mitiglinide inhibited CFTR Cl− currents with half-maximal concentrations of 164 ± 19 [*]μM and 148 ± 36 [*]μM, respectively. However, repaglinide only weakly inhibited CFTR Cl− currents. To understand better how non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents inhibit CFTR, we studied single channels. Channel blockade by both <b>meglitinide</b> and mitiglinide was characterized by flickery closures and a significant decrease in open probability (Po). In contrast, repaglinide was without effect on either channel gating or Po, but caused a small decrease in single-channel current amplitude. Analysis of the dwell time distributions of single channels indicated that both <b>meglitinide</b> and mitiglinide greatly decreased the open time of CFTR. Mitiglinide-induced channel closures were about 3 -fold longer than those of <b>meglitinide.</b> Inhibition of CFTR by <b>meglitinide</b> and mitiglinide was voltage-dependent: at positive voltages channel blockade was relieved. The data demonstrate that non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents inhibit CFTR. This indicates that these agents have a wider specificity of action than previously recognized.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that both D-glucose and glibenclamide stimulate the Na+/K+ pump {{and suggested that}} this may be part of the membrane repolarization process, following the primary depolarization by these agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the non-sulphonylurea <b>meglitinide</b> (HB 699) exerts similar effects as glibenclamide or glucose on the islet Na+/K+ pump and if effects of <b>meglitinide</b> or glibenclamide on this pump activity is paralleled by changes in islet ATP content and/or ATP/ADP ratio. The acyl-amino-alkyl benzoic acid derivative, <b>meglitinide,</b> stimulated the islet ouabain-sensitive portion of 86 Rb+ influx (Na+/K+ pump) by 53 %, while the ouabain-resistant portion was inhibited by 70 %. The stimulatory effect was not additive to that caused by D-glucose, suggesting that both agents may activate the Na+/K+ pump via the same mechanism. Glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) decreased the islet ATP and ADP content as well as the ATP/ADP ratio at 0 [*]mM glucose. These effects were no longer observed at 10 [*]mM glucose. <b>Meglitinide</b> (10 or 50 [*]μM) lowered the islet ATP and ADP content at 0 [*]mM glucose without affecting the ATP/ADP ratio. At 10 [*]mM glucose, however, 10 [*]μM of the drug reduced the islet ATP content but not the ATP/ADP ratio, while 50 [*]μM of the drug, besides lowering the ATP content, also reduced the ATP/ADP ratio. Diazoxide (0. 5 [*]mM) increased the islet ATP content in the absence of glucose, an effect not seen in the presence of 10 [*]mM glucose.

We used the benzamido derivative <b>meglitinide</b> as this drug blocks Kir 6. 2 /SUR 1 and Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 A currents, reversibly and with similar potency.

40|$|Several <b>meglitinide</b> analogs are {{currently}} under investigation as potential insulinotropic tools {{for the treatment}} of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The present study aimed to further insight into the effect of these agents on the secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin by the isolated perfused pancreas. Both repaglinide (0. 01 microM) and A- 4166 (1. 0 microM) stimulated insulin and somatostatin release, but failed to affect glucagon output, from pancreases exposed to 5. 6 mM D-glucose. The secretory response of the B- and D-cells to the hypoglycemic agents was much less marked than that caused by a rise in hexose concentration from 5. 6 - 16. 7 mM. Although repaglinide was tested at a concentration a hundred times lower than that of A- 4166, the drug-induced increase in both insulin and somatostatin secretion persisted for a longer time after exposure to repaglinide, than to A- 4166. The relevance of these findings to the use of <b>meglitinide</b> analogs as antidiabetic agents is double. First, they document that these drugs, although enhancing both insulin and somatostatin release, do not provoke an undesirable stimulation of glucagon secretion. Second, they indicate that even at a very low concentration, repaglinide provokes a protracted insulinotropic action, thus suggesting that the reversibility of the secretory response to this or other <b>meglitinide</b> analogs represents an intrinsic molecular attribute, unrelated to either their biological potency or the relative extent of B-cell stimulation.

We identified patients from a nation-wide database called Registry for Catastrophic Illness, which encompassed almost 100 % of the patients receiving dialysis therapy in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008.

Propensity score adjustment and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset MI.

Binding affinities were compared using membranes from HIT-T 15 cells (β-cell line) and from COS- 7 cells transiently expressing sulphonylurea receptor subtypes (SUR 1, SUR 2 A and SUR 2 B). Inhibition of adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels (KATP-channels) {{was measured in}} mouse pancreatic β-cells. The tested compounds displayed similar binding affinities for SUR 2 A and SUR 2 B. <b>Meglitinide</b> (benzoic acid derivative) bound to SUR 1 and the SUR 2 isoforms with similar affinities. Replacement of the carboxyl group of <b>meglitinide</b> by a methyl group significantly decreased the binding affinities for SUR 1 and the SUR 2 isoforms (> 4 fold) and the potency to inhibit KATP-channel activity of β-cells (24 fold). Replacement of the carboxyl group of <b>meglitinide</b> by a sulphonylurea group significantly increased the affinities for SUR 1 (5 fold) and the SUR 2 isoforms (13 – 16 fold). Glibenclamide bound to the SUR 2 isoforms with 300 – 500 fold lower affinity than to SUR 1. Exchanging the cyclohexyl ring of glibenclamide by a methyl group or removal of the lipophilic side chain of glibenclamide (5 -chloro- 2 -methoxy-benzamidoethyl chain) markedly reduced but did not abolish the selectivity for SUR 1. In conclusion, interaction of sulphonylureas and acidic analogues with SUR 1, SUR 2 A and SUR 2 B is favoured by the anionic group of these drugs. Hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas (e. g. glibenclamide) owe selectivity for SUR 1 to lipophilic substitution on their urea group.

Repaglinide provided similar overall glycaemic control to that achieved with glibenclamide (glyburide), as assessed by glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and fasting blood glucose levels, and was generally well tolerated in well designed clinical trials.

40|$|Because {{management}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus usually involves combined pharmacological therapy to obtain adequate glucose control and treatment of concurrent pathologies (especially dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension), drug-drug interactions must be carefully considered with antihyperglycaemic drugs. Additive glucose-lowering effects have been extensively reported when combining sulphonylureas (or the new insulin secretagogues, <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives, i. e. nateglinide and repaglinide) with metformin, sulphonylureas (or <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives) with thiazolidinediones (also called glitazones) and the biguanide compound metformin with thiazolidinediones. Interest in combining alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with either sulphonylureas (or <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives), metformin or thiazolidinediones has also been demonstrated. These combinations result in lower glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)), fasting glucose and postprandial glucose levels than with either monotherapy. Even if modest pharmacokinetic interferences have been reported with some combinations, they {{do not appear to}} have important clinical consequences. No significant adverse effects, except a higher risk of hypoglycaemic episodes that may be attributed to better glycaemic control, occur with any combination. Challenging the classical dual therapy with sulphonylurea plus metformin, there is a recent trend to use alternative dual combinations (sulphonylurea plus thiazolidinedione or metformin plus thiazolidinedione). In addition, triple therapy {{with the addition of a}} thiazolidinedione to the metformin-sulphonylurea combination has been recently evaluated and allows glucose targets to be reached before insulin therapy is considered. This triple therapy appears to be safe, with no deleterious drug-drug interactions being reported so far. Potential interferences may also occur between glucose-lowering agents and other drugs, and such drug-drug interactions may have important clinical implications. Relevant pharmacological agents are those that are widely coadministered in diabetic patients (e. g. lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive agents); those that have a narrow efficacy/toxicity ratio (e. g. digoxin, warfarin); or those that are known to induce (rifampicin [rifampin]) or inhibit (fluconazole) the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) system. Metformin is currently a key compound in the pharmacological {{management of}} type 2 diabetes, used either alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics. There are no clinically relevant metabolic interactions with metformin, because this compound is not metabolised and does not inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. In contrast, sulphonylureas, <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives and thiazolidinediones are extensively metabolised in the liver via the CYP system and thus, may be subject to drug-drug metabolic interactions. Many HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are also metabolised via the CYP system. Even if modest pharmacokinetic interactions may occur, it is not clear whether drug-drug interactions between oral antihyperglycaemic agents and statins may have clinical consequences regarding both efficacy and safety. In contrast, a marked pharmacokinetic interference has been reported between gemfibrozil and repaglinide and, to a lesser extent, between gemfibrozil and rosiglitazone. This leads to a drastic increase in plasma concentrations of each antihyperglycaemic agent when they are coadministered with the fibric acid derivative, and an increased risk of adverse effects. Some antihypertensive agents may favour hypoglycaemic episodes when co-prescribed with sulphonylureas or <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives, especially ACE inhibitors, but this effect seems to result from a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction rather than from a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction. No, or only modest, interferences have been described with glucose-lowering agents and other pharmacological compounds such as digoxin or warfarin. The effects of inducers or inhibitors of CYP isoenzymes on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the glucose-lowering agents of each pharmacological class has been tested. Significantly increased (with CYP inhibitors) or decreased (with CYP inducers) plasma levels of sulphonylureas, <b>meglitinide</b> derivatives and thiazolidinediones have been reported in healthy volunteers, and these pharmacokinetic changes may lead to enhanced or reduced glucose-lowering action, and thus hypoglycaemia or worsening of metabolic control, respectively.

Nateglinide, {{a member of}} the <b>meglitinide</b> class, which has been shown to lower postprandial hyperglycemia by increasing the first phase of insulin secretion, was not effective in decreasing both the new cases of diabetes and the new cardiovascular events in a population at high risk (1). Valsartan, an angiotensin (AT- 1) blocker, was ineffective on cardiovascular events but significantly—even marginally—reduced the onset of new diabetes (2). The negative results of nateglinide immediately raised the concern about the possibility that postprandial hyperglycemi...|$|E
40|$|Both {{control and}} hereditarily {{diabetic}} (Goto-Kakizaki) rats were administered twice daily for 7 days with an oral solution of carboxymethylcellulose containing, when required, glibenclamide (1. 0 microgram g- 1 body wt.) or nateglinide (50. 0 micrograms g- 1 body wt.). The increase in plasma D-glucose concentration and decrease in insulinogenic index {{caused by the}} bleeding and handling of the rats prior to sacrifice was more pronounced in the hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinemic diabetic rats than in the control animals. Eighteen hours after the last oral loading, a sizeable fall in plasma D-glucose concentration and increase in plasma insulin concentration was only observed in the glibenclamide-treated control rats, indicating a more prolonged biological effect of the hypoglycaemic sulphonylurea, {{as compared to the}} <b>meglitinide</b> analog. This coincided {{with the fact that the}} insulin content of the islets, their secretory response to a high concentration of D-glucose and their basal biosynthetic activity were more severely affected in glibenclamide than nateglinide-treated animals, especially in the control rats. It is proposed, therefore, that the <b>meglitinide</b> analog, considered as a new insulinotropic tool for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, may offer the far-from-negligible advantage of minimising the risk of a sustained decrease in both islet insulin content and glycaemia.

40|$|Background: Given the {{increase}} in medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinicians and patients need information about their effec-tiveness and safety to make informed choices. Purpose: To summarize the {{benefits and harms of}} metformin, second-generation sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, <b>meglitinides,</b> dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonists, as monotherapy and in combination, to treat adults with type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Reg-ister of Controlled Trials were searched from inception through April 2010 for English-language observational studies and trials. The MEDLINE search was updated to December 2010 for long-term clinical outcomes. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently screened reports and identified 140 trials and 26 observational studies of head-to...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, {{and others in}} the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetesrelated complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A 1 c (A 1 C) of 6. 5 % or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A 1 C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase- 4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, a-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, <b>meglitinides,</b> and bile aci...|$|R
