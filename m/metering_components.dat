50|$|TPE {{materials}} {{have the potential}} to be recyclable since they can be molded, extruded and reused like plastics, but they have typical elastic properties of rubbers which are not recyclable owing to their thermosetting characteristics. TPE also require little or no compounding, with no need to add reinforcing agents, stabilizers or cure systems. Hence, batch-to-batch variations in weighting and <b>metering</b> <b>components</b> are absent, leading to improved consistency in both raw materials and fabricated articles. Depending on the environment, TPEs have outstanding thermal properties and material stability when exposed to a broad range of temperatures and non-polar materials. TPEs consume less energy to produce, can be colored easily by most dyes, and allow economical quality control.|$|E

30|$|The main {{usage of}} the SEMD is to measure power data of 230 -V devices. Therefore, the SEMD is {{connected}} to the 230 -V power grid and can be supplied through an integrated transformer. It is also thinkable to use the SEMD communication infrastructure as back-end for different smart home metering platform application scenarios that utilize distributed non-electrical sensors. These sensors may not be connected to the power grid but could use battery supply. Battery lifetime depends on nominal voltage and capacity of the used battery. A supply voltage level of 3 V with a capacity of 2400 mAh can be achieved by using two serial connected Mignon (AA) batteries. Our calculations show that for the communication part, the battery’s self-discharge is higher than the SEMD’s communication power consumption (client 19.269 μW, master 10.394 μW). This means that the lifetime on battery supply mainly depends on the primary sensor. With enabled measuring, the SEMD’s battery lifetime is very low (client < 18 days). This is due to the high power consumption of the current and voltage <b>metering</b> <b>components.</b> Power consumption of different sensors (e.g., temperature sensors) may be lower, resulting in longer battery lifetime.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address three {{challenges}} that are present when building and analyzing wireless sensor networks (WSN) as part of ubiquitous computing environment: {{the need for an}} in-situ user interface, a data logger, and a power consumption meter. Solutions for the above have been presented using laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), onboard flash memory chips of limited size (usually 1 MB), and laboratory test equipment. All of them have a good utility for the right applications. However, considering a certain variety of WSNs, where size, battery life, and cost are crucial, none of the above solutions is satisfactory. In this paper we present a compact, lightweight, low power, and low cost multimodal sensor module SeeMote that meets the stated challenges, and is compatible with the popular MICAz mote. Our module has the following components: (1) a graphical user interface component that combines a color liquid crystal display (LCD) and 5 -way buttons, (2) a power <b>meter</b> <b>component</b> that is reconfigurable for attaching various low-power devices, and (3) a data logger component that is interfaced to a removable secure digital (SD) or multimedia memory card (MMC). The module dimensions are 34 x 58 x 12 mm. This paper describes the hardware and software design and experiences while developing and using the device. The device is evaluated by comparing its parameters and functionality to laptop and PDA solutions. We conclude that SeeMote is preferred for certain WSNs, such as very large scale, difficult to reach, and wearable WSNs. We also present several applications that use the LCD module, such as the portable frequency spectrum analyzer and remote sensory data display device. 1...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{optimization}} {{of diesel}} {{fuel injection equipment}} and combustion process is mandatory to fulfill the future emission regulations. Among the involved phenomena, a preliminary role is played by the strong link between the combustion behavior and the adopted strategies to promote the mixing of reactants. The aim of the present work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive modeling approach, having the capability to take the deep connection between fuel injection phenomena into account. For this scope, different computational tools, characterized by different roles, have been used and coupled, accounting for the interdependencies of the relevant sub-processes. Three main multi-step modeling approaches are outlined and then used in the analysis of practical cases; these can be summarized as follows: 1) multi-step modeling (0 D- 3 D CFD) for injection process and spray simulation with a unitary approach; 2) double step modeling (3 D- 0 D) of fuel <b>metering</b> <b>component</b> operation; 3) comprehensive multi-step lumped modeling of injection system operation, spray formation and fuel vaporization. The mechanical-hydraulic modeling of the injection systems is based on the 0 - 1 D code AMESim.

Several cases have been considered and the contribution of the modeling approach is presented evaluated.

Investigations are devoted to evaluate the influence on injection process of fuel characteristics and composition, injection strategies, injector layout, geometrical features and needle operating conditions...|$|R
