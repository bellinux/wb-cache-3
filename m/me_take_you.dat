5|$|Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical film {{depicting}} {{the murder of}} John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was {{written and directed by}} Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche.|$|E
25|$|Following the murder, and for {{the first}} six years in Attica, Chapman refused all {{requests}} for interviews. James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. Chapman later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Democrat and Chronicle. In 1992 Jones published a book, Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon.|$|E

500|$|The real Mark David Chapman is {{currently}} incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, {{he has not}} spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title [...] "Chapter 27" [...] suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, {{to the point of}} attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.|$|E
500|$|An African hip hop and hip hop song, {{the track}} {{was written by}} the two musicians while {{production}} was handled by disc jockey CedSolo. The recording lyrically finds Sarkodie discussing that he's the [...] "new guy" [...] in the music industry. [...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's up to me to make sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E
500|$|Canadian singer Bryan Adams has {{released}} thirteen studio albums, six compilation albums, two soundtrack albums, four live albums, and sixty-nine singles. After {{the success of}} his debut single, [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Dancing" [...] (1979), Adams signed a recording contract with A Records. Bryan Adams (1980), his debut album, peaked at number 69 on the Canadian RPM Albums Chart. Adams followed this with You Want It You Got It (1981), which peaked at number 118 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold in Canada. Cuts Like a Knife, his third release, became his first successful work outside Canada. The album charted within the top ten in Canada and the United States and was certified three-times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Reckless (1984), his fourth studio album, selling over 12 million copies worldwide and featured the hit singles [...] "Run to You", [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Summer of '69". In 1987, he released Into the Fire, which reached platinum status in the United States and triple-platinum in Canada.|$|E

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{three distinct}} {{versions of the}} song. After Lennon played the song for the other Beatles on his acoustic guitar, the band recorded the first take. Lennon played an Epiphone Casino; McCartney played a Mellotron, a tape replay keyboard instrument purchased by Lennon in August 1965 (with another model hired in after encouragement from keyboardist Mike Pinder of the Moody Blues); George Harrison played electric slide guitar, and Ringo Starr played drums. The first recorded take began with the verse [...] "Living is easy …", instead of the chorus, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> down", which starts the released version. The first verse also led directly to the second, with no chorus between. Lennon's vocals were automatically double-tracked from the words [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] {{through the end of}} the last verse. The last verse, beginning [...] "Always, no sometimes", has three-part harmonies, with McCartney and Harrison singing [...] "dreamy background vocals". This version was soon abandoned and went unreleased until the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1947, the Perkins {{family moved}} from Lake County, Tennessee, to Madison County, Tennessee. A new radio that ran on house current {{rather than a}} battery and the {{closeness}} to Memphis exposed Perkins to {{a greater variety of}} music. At age fourteen, using the I-IV-V chord progression common in country music of the day, he wrote a song that came to be known around Jackson as [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> to the Movie, Magg" [...] (the song later persuaded Sam Phillips to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label).|$|E
2500|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> back to {{the winter}} of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place {{of work in the}} City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance {{through a}} mutual friend in a Vancouver music store. Vallance was the former drummer and {{principal}} songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band {{to focus on a}} career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later, which proved to {{be the beginning of a}} partnership which still exists in 2016. Later in 1978, Adams signed to A records for one dollar. Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years, most notably [...] "I'm Ready" [...] (recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged) and [...] "Remember", which was recorded on his first album. Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album was released. Also recorded during this time was the disco song [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Dancing" [...] featuring Adams' vocal sped up to meet the 122BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 along with its B-Side [...] "Don't Turn Me Away". [...] "Straight From The Heart" [...] was also written during this period. The song was later recorded for Adams's third album [...] "Cuts Like A Knife" [...] in 1983 and released as a single, becoming Adams's first top 10 record in the U.S. in 1983.|$|E
