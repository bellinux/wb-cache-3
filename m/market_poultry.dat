[...] The research team tested more than 53,000 birds in southern China from July 2005 through June 2006. 2.4% of the birds had H5N1, more than double the previous 0.9% rate. 68% them were in the new Fujian-like lineage.

[...] "All the analyzed Fujian-like viruses had molecular characteristics that indicated sensitivity to oseltamivir, the first-choice antiviral drug for H5N1 infection.

40|$|The {{development}} of highly pathogenic avian H 5 N 1 influenza viruses in poultry in Eurasia accompanied {{with the increase}} in human infection in 2006 suggests that the virus has not been effectively contained and that the pandemic threat persists. Updated virological and epidemiological findings from our market surveillance in southern China demonstrate that H 5 N 1 influenza viruses continued to be panzootic in different types of poultry. Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H 5 N 1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005. Viruses from this sublineage gradually replaced those multiple regional distinct sublineages and caused recent human infection in China. These viruses have already transmitted to Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a new transmission and outbreak wave in Southeast Asia. Serological studies suggest that H 5 N 1 seroconversion in <b>market</b> <b>poultry</b> is low and that vaccination may have facilitated the selection of the Fujian-like sublineage.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{institutional}} and governance factors {{on the performance of}} 10 smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and <b>market</b> <b>poultry,</b> one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa’s new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.

It includes information on pricing, regulations, processing and relationship marketing. The decision to market meat poultry requires a basic change in the way growers think about production. The question is no longer how many birds I can raise but how many I can sell at a reasonable profit. Pricing Several factors must be considered in pricing. First, determine the average amount of profit you need from each bird. Second, know your average cost to produce each bird. Finally, discover prices charged by others who are producing a similar quality product in your general region. Regulations In Nebraska, you can kill and process up to 20, 000 chickens or 5, 000 turkeys raised on your farm annually without Federal inspection. You can sell these directly to household customers, restaurants, hotels and boarding houses for use in their dining rooms or preparing meals for sale to customers.

Mesmo assim, ocupa lugar de destaque no cenário nacional como produtor de ovos e de carne de frango. Para entender essa situação o trabalho analisa as estratégias de grandes unidades industriais a partir de suas situações no ambiente. A base teórica da análise é assentada nas abordagens SWOT, Cadeias de Valores, e Grupos Estratégicos.

40|$|Poster Presentations - Genetic and Antigenic EvolutionThe {{transmission}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first outbreak wave of this virus in late 2003. Subsequently H 5 N 1 influenza virus has become endemic in poultry in this region, which has {{lead to the}} sustained {{transmission of}} those viruses and repeated outbreaks in poultry and human infection cases. This situation has raised global concern of a coming influenza pandemic sometime in the near future. Although surveillance work in <b>market</b> <b>poultry</b> had been strengthened following this initial outbreak in Southeast Asian countries, the lack of influenza surveillance prior to the outbreaks {{made it difficult to}} identify the precursors and transmission pathways of those H 5 N 1 viruses. To determine the possible source of those H 5 N 1 viruses responsible for this first transmission wave we recently conducted further sequencing of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan and Yunnan Provinces in southern China from 2001 to 2003. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of 50 H 5 N 1 isolates from this period indicated that eight viruses, exclusively from Yunnan, fell as the direct progenitor to viruses isolated from Vietnam. A further two viruses isolated from Hunan were the direct precursor to those viruses from Indonesia. In general, phylogenetic analysis revealed similar relationships for the NA gene and each of the 6 internal genes, indicating that these viruses also belonged to the same H 5 N 1 genotype Z that is predominant throughout Southeast Asia. These results clearly show a transmission of H 5 N 1 viruses from Yunnan to Vietnam and from Hunan to Indonesia. Trade of poultry may be the major route of virus transmission between Yunnan and Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear and could be either via migratory birds or poultry movement. postprin...|$|E
