40|$|The {{impulse to}} space {{structures}} from meteoroids and debris is enhanced above the incident particle momentum by hypervelocity impact processes namely cratering or penetration. Although laboratory experiments reproduce only the lower range of desired calibration (up to some 9 kms- 1 for mm particles) sensors flown near Comet Halley on the Giotto spacecraft (at 68 kms- 1) provide data at velocities {{up to the}} fastest meteoroids in space. We review experimental data, and formulations thereof, introducing theoretical considerations where applicable. Special effects for thin target <b>marginal</b> <b>perforation</b> such as Solar Arrays apply but de-rating for very thin targets is derived, again based on space data from the Giotto mission...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pancreas {{transplantation}} is {{the best}} treatment option in selected patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Here we report a patient with a nonmarginal duodenal perforation five years after a simultaneous pancreas-living donor kidney transplantation (SPLKT). Presentation of case: A 31 -year old male who underwent SPLKT five years previously presented with severe abdominal pain. He had a <b>marginal</b> duodenal <b>perforation</b> four years later, treated by primary closure and drainage. Biopsy of the pancreas and duodenum graft at that time showed chronic rejection in the pancreas and acute inflammation with an ulcer in the duodenum. At presentation, computerized tomography scan showed mesenteric pneumatosis with enteric leak and ileal dilatation proximal to the anastomotic site. We performed emergent laparotomy and found a 1. 0  cm perforation at the nonmarginal, posterior wall of the duodenum. Undigested fiber-rich food was extracted from the site and an omental patch placed over the perforation. An ileostomy was created proximal to the omega loop for decompression and a drain placed nearby. The postoperative course was unremarkable. Discussion: There are only eight previous cases of graft duodenal perforation in the literature. Fiber-rich food residue passing through the anastomosis with impaction {{may have led to}} this perforation. Conclusion: When a patient is stable, even in the presence of delayed duodenal graft perforation, graft excision may not be necessary. Intraoperative exploration should include Doppler ultrasound examination of the vasculature to rule out thrombosis as a contributor to ischemia. Tissue biopsy should be performed to diagnose rejection...|$|R
40|$|Background: The tympanic {{membrane}} perforation is generally caused by infection or trauma. It {{is a condition}} that can cause hearing loss; its incidence varies between 1 and 3 % {{of the population in}} the United States, and even less than 1 % in the world population. Objective: This study is to conduct a pilot test in which the effectiveness of conservative treatment was measured and compared by applying phenytoin or platelet-rich plasma to close tympanic perforations and the healing period of the same. Patients and methods: Ten patients were included and all of them fulfilled the selection criteria: Age over five years-old, indiscriminate sex with a diagnosis of perforated eardrum, eardrum perforation between 30 and 60 % and presence of tympanic remnant; and no previous surgical treatment. Elimination criteria were those patients with <b>marginal</b> eardrum <b>perforations,</b> patients who were not on antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, poor response to platelet-rich plasma after 6 weeks, patients with known autoimmune, active neoplastic, atopic otic conditions and those currently under immunosuppressive treatments. Participants were randomized into two groups according to treatment: phenytoin (0. 2  mg) or platelet-rich plasma (0. 2 – 0. 5  cc). Results: Ten patients with unilateral tympanic perforation were recorded whose average age was 26. 9  ±  14. 9 years; the sex distribution was 1. 5 : 1 male predominance. In treatment A, the average closing time was 3. 8  ±  0. 836 weeks; meanwhile, in the treatment B the closure time was 5. 2  ±  0. 836 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{the flux}} data of {{hypervelocity}} impact craters and perforations from recovered metallic satellite surfaces (such as from NASA's LDEF and ESA's Eureca) is primarily directed towards the derivation of particle diameters. This requires careful calibration, {{especially in the}} transition region near to <b>marginal</b> <b>perforation</b> for targets of finite thickness. This calibration is usually {{in the form of}} a ''hole growth equation''. Although several thin foil formulae exist and many thick target formulae, the only established equation which attempts to interpret near marginal impacts does not seek to interpret impacts where the perforation is smaller than the foil thickness. In this work intuitive trends are used to select an appropriate mathematical form for a new equation, after which hypervelocity impact data on thin foils are used for defining the parameters...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{report a}} novel {{tympanoplasty}} modification for anterior tympanic membrane perforation closure. Materials and Methods. A prospective study on 13 patients who underwent inferior tympanoplasty between December 2008 and May 2011 was carried out. In our technique, an inferior {{rather than a}} posterior flap is raised and the graft is laid from the inferior direction to obtain better access to the anterior part of the tympanic membrane perforation and provide better support. Results. A total of 13 patients underwent the novel inferior tympanoplasty technique {{with a mean age}} of 33 years. Six patients had undergone tympanoplasties and/or mastoidectomies in the past, 3 in the contralateral ear. A <b>marginal</b> <b>perforation</b> was observed in 3 cases, total perforation in 2 and subtotal in 1 case. The mean preoperative pure-tone average was 40. 4 [*]dB (10 to 90 [*]dB), compared to 26. 5 [*]dB (10 to 55 [*]dB) postoperatively. All perforations were found to be closed but one (92. 3 % success rate). Conclusions. The inferior tympanoplasty technique provides a favorable outcome in terms of tympanic membrane closure and hearing improvement for anterior perforations, even in difficult and complex cases. It is based on a well-known technique and is easy to implement...|$|E

40|$|With {{the purpose}} {{to study the}} {{feasibility}} of the methods for repairing the tympanic perforations which was left after chronic suppurative otitis media, the author performed permanent repair of tympanic perforations by three methods, namely, 1) after making a new wound on {{the margin of the}} perforation, it is closed by the transplantation of a free skin graft, 2) after making a new wound on the margin of the perforation, the closure is attempted with the transplantation of a graft from the buccal mucous membrane, and 3) first the margin of the perforation is cauterized with trichloracetic acid and then the closure is effected by patching a strip of human amniotic membrane. Following results were obtained. 1. Of the total of 43 cases receiving the repair of perforations in our clinic, the closure of the perforations was successful in 10 cases (58. 8 %) out of 17 that received the transplantation of human amniotic membrane; 8 cases (53. 3 %) out of 15 cases the free skin grafts method were used proved to be successful; and 8 cases (72. 7 %) out of 11 cases whose buccal mucous membrane were used as grafts proved successful. 2. Of 40 cases with central perforation the closure proved to be successful in 26 cases, while in 3 cases with <b>marginal</b> <b>perforation</b> it resulted all in failure. 3. The possibility of obtaining successful closure of the perforations is greater in those having dry middle ear cavity over one year before the operation than those with dry ear for less than one year. 4. Infection of the middle ear which had not been controlled before the surgery or occured after the surgery is one of the factors causing the failure of this operation. 5. After the repair of perforations it seems advisable to leave the graft alone without touching it until the demarcation between the graft and the tissue underneath (newly developed tympanic membrane) is completed. 6. The hearing before the operation, the preoperative hearing at the time when perforated tympanic membranes were patched with cigaret paper, and the hearing after the closure of perforations were studied and the following results were obtained. a. The hearing improvement in the average of speech range after the closure is 14. 2 db compared with the gain of 9. 8 db when the cigaret paper was applied before the operation. In other words, the hearing improvement after the operative closure of perforations is slightly better than that anticipated preoperatively using cigaret paper. b. The hearing is improved for all frequencies after the closure of the perforations, showing marked improvement for lower frequencies (128 cps- 1024 cps) ...|$|E
