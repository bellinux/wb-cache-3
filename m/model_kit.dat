Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003).

There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly.
