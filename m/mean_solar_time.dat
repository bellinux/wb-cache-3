25|$|Furthermore, the {{discrepancy}} between the molad interval and the mean synodic month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale, such as that provided by an atomic clock, the mean synodic month is becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean synodic month is becoming gradually shorter in terms of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|A leap {{second is}} a one-second {{adjustment}} that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{in order to}} keep its time of day close to the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> or UT1. Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation. Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 27 leap seconds have been inserted, the most recent on December 31, 2016 at 23:59:60 UTC.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} in History, advances in time-keeping {{have resulted in}} various time scales. One useful time scale is Universal Time (especially the UT1 variant), which is the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at 0 degrees longitude (the Greenwich meridian). One second of UT is 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. This time scale {{is known to be}} somewhat variable. Since all civil calendars count actual solar days, they must ultimately be based on UT (but the actual timing of official midnight is based on UTC).|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{objections}} to the proposed change have been answered by its opponents. For example, Dr. Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)'s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, is responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years could {{be compared to the}} 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> the one hour offset by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically extra-large time zones.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has kept}} {{a version of the}} UTC atomic time scale since the 1990s, but Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) {{remained}} the formal basis for the standard times of all of the states through 2005. In November 2004, the state and territory attorneys-general endorsed a proposal from the Australian National Measurement Institute to adopt UTC as the standard of all Australian standard times, thereby eliminating the effects of slight variations in the rate of rotation of the Earth that are inherent in <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> All states have adopted the UTC standard, starting on 1 September 2005.|$|E
50|$|The times {{above are}} based on local <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> rather than {{standard}} time. To convert to standard time, one needs to add or take off up to 30 minutes or more, depending on one's birth location west or east respectively of the central meridian of the given time zone. For example, London, marking the central meridian of Greenwich <b>Mean</b> <b>Time,</b> has <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> equivalent to standard time.|$|R

In 1897 a small transit telescope replaced the theodolite and in about 1898 two standard German precision clocks were installed to track sidereal <b>time</b> and <b>solar</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time.</b> Several methods of broadcasting the time were used: ...|$|R
25|$|If the {{hypothesis}} is true, then the Chinese probably knew about differentials centuries before Europeans. There has been {{speculation that the}} ancient Greeks knew about them in about 100 BCE, but this is now considered unlikely. The first true differential gear definitely {{known to have been}} used in the Western world was by Joseph Williamson in 1720. He used a differential for correcting the equation of time for a clock that displayed both <b>mean</b> and <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Even then, the differential was not fully appreciated in Europe until James White emphasized its importance and provided details for it in his Century of Inventions (1822).|$|R
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International Atomic Time (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E

5000|$|A mean {{sidereal day}} is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds ( [...] hours or [...] <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> days), the <b>time</b> it takes Earth {{to make one}} {{rotation}} relative to the vernal equinox. (Due to nutation, an actual sidereal day is not quite so constant.) The vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day ("sidereal" [...] {{is derived from the}} Latin sidus meaning [...] "star") is 0.0084 seconds shorter than Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>time</b> is {{measured}} by the apparent diurnal motion of the Sun, and local noon in apparent <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is the moment when the Sun is exactly due south or north (depending on the observer's latitude and the season).

50|$|Earth {{makes one}} {{rotation}} around its axis in a sidereal day; {{during that time}} it moves a short distance (about 1°) along its orbit around the Sun.

2500|$|It {{took some}} time for the astronomical {{community}} to accept the reality and the scale of tidal effects. [...] But eventually {{it became clear that}} three effects are involved, when measured in terms of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Beside the effects of perturbational changes in Earth's orbital eccentricity, as found by Laplace and corrected by Adams, there are two tidal effects (a combination first suggested by Emmanuel Liais). [...] First there is a real retardation of the Moon's angular rate of orbital motion, due to tidal exchange of angular momentum between Earth and Moon. [...] This increases the Moon's angular momentum around Earth (and moves the Moon to a higher orbit with a lower orbital speed). Secondly there is an apparent increase in the Moon's angular rate of orbital motion (when measured in terms of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time).</b> This arises from Earth's loss of angular momentum and the consequent increase in length of day.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{wording of}} the Time Act says that during the entire year Saskatchewan observes [...] "central {{standard}} time", which is defined to be [...] "the time that is six hours behind Greenwich time". [...] With respect to <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> however, this translates into Saskatchewan effectively being on DST year round.

50|$|The Alaska Time Zone {{applies to}} the {{territory}} of the state of Alaska east of 169°30′ W. Given that the UTC−9 time corresponds to the <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at 9 × 15° = 135° W (roughly, Juneau), the westernmost locales of the Alaska Time Zone are off by up to 169°30′ − 135° = 34°30′ from local <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> This <b>means</b> that when a clock correctly set to Alaska time, at a location just east of 169°30′ W, shows noon, local <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is around 9:42 a.m. When UTC−8 is applied in the summer (because of daylight saving time), this effect becomes even more apparent. For example, on June 12 at noon AKDT, the <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at the extreme westerly points of the Alaskan time zone will be only 8:42 a.m. Very few people notice this, however, as these locations are virtually uninhabited, and for the very few people who do live there, the long days in the summer and short days in the winter make the sunrise and sunset times less important than areas closer to the equator. By contrast, in Juneau, which is much closer to the 135° west meridian, <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> noon occurs around 11:57 a.m., very close to clock noon.|$|R

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this process, the mean solar day, which is {{nominally}} 86,400 seconds long, is actually getting longer when measured in SI seconds with stable atomic clocks. (The SI second, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.)</b> The small difference accumulates over time, which leads to an increasing difference between our clock time (Universal Time) on the one hand, and Atomic Time and Ephemeris Time on the other hand: see ΔT. This led to the introduction of the leap second in 1972 [...] to compensate for differences in the bases for time standardization.|$|E
2500|$|In 1832, Gauss {{proposed}} {{using the}} second {{as the base}} unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second system of units. The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in 1862 stated that [...] "All men of science are agreed to use the second of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> as the unit of time." [...] BAAS formally proposed the CGS system in 1874, although this system was gradually replaced over the next 70 years by MKS units. Both the CGS and MKS systems used the same second as their base unit of time. MKS was adopted internationally during the 1940s, defining the second as [...] of a mean solar day.|$|E
2500|$|Edmond Halley was {{the first}} to suggest, in 1695, that the mean motion of the Moon was {{apparently}} getting faster, by comparison with ancient eclipse observations, but he gave no data. [...] (It was not yet known in Halley's time that what is actually occurring includes a slowing-down of Earth's rate of rotation: see also Ephemeris time – History. [...] When measured as a function of <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> rather than uniform time, the effect appears as a positive acceleration.) In 1749 Richard Dunthorne confirmed Halley's suspicion after re-examining ancient records, and produced the first quantitative estimate for the size of this apparent effect: a centurial rate of +10″ (arcseconds) in lunar longitude, which is a surprisingly accurate result for its time, not differing greatly from values assessed later, e.g. in 1786 by de Lalande, and to compare with values from about 10″ to nearly 13″ being derived about a century later.|$|E
50|$|The {{average of}} the true solar day {{during the course of}} an entire year is the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day, which {{contains}} 86,400 <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> seconds. Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.|$|R
5000|$|Earth's {{rotational}} speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases {{the length of}} the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day. The length of the SI second was calibrated {{on the basis of the}} second of ephemeris time and can now be seen to have a relationship with the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb. As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day in the mid‑19th century. In earlier centuries, the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the end of the 20th century, {{the length of the}} <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day (also known simply as [...] "length of day" [...] or [...] "LOD") was approximately 86,400.0013 s. For this reason, UT is now [...] "slower" [...] than TAI by the difference (or [...] "excess" [...] LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.|$|R
25|$|However, for {{the past}} several centuries, the length of the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day has been {{increasing}} by about 1.4–1.7 ms per century, depending on the averaging time. By 1961, the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day was already a millisecond or two longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Therefore, time standards that change the date after precisely 86,400 SI seconds, such as the International Atomic Time (TAI), will get increasingly ahead of time standards tied to the <b>mean</b> <b>solar</b> day, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).|$|R
