25|$|They {{are natural}} hunters with an {{excellent}} {{ability to take}} training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog {{is likely to take}} over the training session.|$|E

However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require {{a good deal of}} exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty minutes to an hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992).|$|E

25|$|Michael Vaughan won the toss again, {{just like}} in the first Test, and put Bangladesh into bat. A {{thoroughly}} professional bowling performance from the England bowlers followed, with Harmison, playing at his home ground, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the conditions to take 5 wickets as the clearly outclassed Bangladeshis succumbed for 104. Only Javed Omar and Khaled Mashud made it into double figures. In reply, England quickly overcame the deficit for the loss of just Andrew Strauss, the only English batter who averaged less than 80 in this Test series. By close on the first day England were 269 for 3, with pundits reckoning the game would not reach the third day.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat, at grave risk of {{his life}} {{above and beyond the}} call of duty, as section leader and pilot of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942. Having lost the assistance of his teammates, Lieutenant O'Hare interposed his fighter between his ship and an advancing enemy formation of 9 attacking twin-engine heavy bombers. Without hesitation, alone and unaided, he repeatedly attacked this enemy formation, at close range in the face of intense combined machine gun and cannon fire. Despite this concentrated opposition, Lieutenant O'Hare, by his gallant and courageous action, his extremely skillful marksmanship in <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> every shot of his limited amount of ammunition, shot down 5 enemy bombers and severely damaged a sixth before they reached the bomb release point. As a result of his gallant action—one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation—he undoubtedly saved his carrier from serious damage.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Stevie Wonder {{had become}} one of the most popular figures in R and pop music, not only in the U.S., but worldwide. Within a short space of time, the albums Talking Book, Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale were all {{back-to-back}} top five successes, with the latter two winning Grammy Award for Album of the Year, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. By the end of 1975, Wonder became serious about quitting the music industry and emigrating to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He had expressed his anger with the way that the U.S. government was running the country. A farewell concert was being considered as the best way to bring down the curtain on his career. Wonder changed his decision, when he signed a new contract with Motown on August 5, 1975, thinking he was better off <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his career. At the time, rivals such as Arista and Epic were also interested in him. The contract was laid out as a seven-year, seven LP, $37 million deal and gave him full artistic control, making this the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Almost at the beginning Wonder took a year off from the music market, with a project for a double album to be released in 1976.|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway {{return in}} a blog, with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to her fears and {{excitement}} {{about her new}} play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page. In 2011, Fonda published a new book: Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit – <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> all of your life. The book offers stories from her own {{life as well as}} from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls [...] "the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond".|$|E
500|$|A {{recurrent}} {{focus of}} the album is love, a theme that sometimes overlaps with spirituality as Stevens seems to address both a lover and a divine power. Another important theme is that of mortality — the song [...] "Now That I'm Older" [...] has been noted as [...] "repeatedly [...] mortality {{and the importance of}} <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> life." [...] Acknowledging the interplay of these two themes, the album has been described as having songs [...] "in which love and death reign darkly over an imaginative landscape peopled with apparitions, ghosts, orators and space travellers".|$|E
500|$|Music critics responded {{generally}} {{favorably to}} [...] "Jai Ho (You Are My Destiny)". Newsround praised the song by saying [...] " [...] sounds {{right at home}} – <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her soulful R voice and hitting all the (incredibly) high notes on this Eastern-themed piece of pop!" [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote that, [...] "The Hindi original, which soundtracks the Bollywood dance routine {{at the end of}} the movie, is far more urgent and atmospheric, but this remake works nicely enough as a slick, shamelessly opportunistic PCD single. Well, that hollered [...] "JAI HO!" [...] makes for a pretty sweet pop hook, you have to admit".|$|E

500|$|Naval combat {{was subject}} to more {{criticism}} than land battles. PC Format described the visuals in a naval battle as [...] "incredible", but stated that the controls were [...] "frustrating; genuine naval tactics fast disappear {{out of the window}} as [...] struggles to bring [...] navy’s cannons to bear on the enemy". PC Gamer UK reciprocated this view, but noted that naval strategy was a [...] "deeply difficult task" [...] for a developer, and that [...] "The Creative Assembly have done the best that their game template would allow". IGN praised the graphical quality of the naval battles and stated that [...] "trying to line ships up correctly, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the wind and choosing targets appropriately is very rewarding", but that [...] "the formations and pathfinding leave a lot to be desired". GameSpot commented that [...] "the AI seems incapable of managing [...] with much success".|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, Lovato {{performed}} the song in both of her Warm Up Tour and the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour, for the latter she served as the opening act. Later in 2009, the song was performed during her Summer Tour 2009. While reviewing a show in Glendale, Arizona, Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic wrote that the song [...] "survived the transformation to an unplugged ballad, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Lovato's most vulnerable vocal performance of the night." [...] In 2010, she performed the song during her South American tour. Lovato also performed the song during her set at the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert World Tour 2010. Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Lovato performed a [...] "high-energy, high-volume" [...] version of the song. In September 2011, Lovato performed the song during the revue concert An Evening with Demi Lovato. Lovato also performed an acoustic medley of [...] "Don't Forget" [...] and [...] "Catch Me" [...] at the Vevo Certified SuperFanFest in 2014.|$|E
500|$|After scoring 81 for New South Wales in {{his next}} match, against the MCC, Morris was {{selected}} to make his Test debut in the First Test against England in Brisbane. He failed {{in his first two}} Tests, managing just two and five, although Australia won both matches by an innings. Despite being criticised for having a [...] "loose technique" [...] by Neville Cardus, Bradman advised Morris to stick to his approach. Morris responded by scoring 83 and 110 in the traditional pre-Christmas match between New South Wales and Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the top score in both innings. However, he was unable to prevent an innings defeat. He was retained for the Third Test in Melbourne, but made only 21 in the first innings. If he had failed a fourth time, it could have allowed another player to claim his position, but Morris secured his place with his maiden Test century, scoring 155 in the second innings, and <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> an ideal batting surface. After defending stoutly {{at the beginning of the}} innings, Morris accelerated his scoring, employing a wide range of strokes to reach 150 in six hours.|$|E

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was given}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according}} to Metacritic. Several reviews praised {{the amount of}} value that Metroid Prime Hunters offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. GameZone considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. The Toronto Sun remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and The Press called Metroid Prime Hunters the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. The Australian agreed that the graphics are [...] "outstanding" [...] and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and The Independent asserted that Metroid Prime Hunters was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. GamePros review stated that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine how}} Nintendo squeezed Hunters into a tiny DS cartridge." [...] Despite a few [...] "small quirks", the magazine noted that Hunters [...] "is a very polished game". The Times concurred with these claims, remarking, [...] "A lot of thought has clearly gone into <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the DS's touch-screen capability here, and it works gloriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{noted the}} rarity of {{brothers}} like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick. In {{the soap opera}} genre, brothers with a standing rivalry {{as well as a}} strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity. Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared [...] "men, makeup, and misery." [...] Dimitri and Edmund's relationship was scripted as complicated, transitioning between loving and antagonistic. Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media. Soap Opera Digest named them Best Brothers of 1994, saying, [...] "In Michael Nader (Dimitri) and John Callahan (Edmund), AMC has charismatic performers with chemistry, and they're <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Complications in the brothers' relationship included childhood jealousies, the revelation that they were brothers, Dimitri's one-night stand with Edmund's wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey, and the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle. Along with the conflict, they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other. In describing the relationship, Nader said, [...] "The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri, the Marick brothers, there wasn't a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that John and I could bring to that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Making</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the inside}} of the bend in the river, Cambridge pushed on to be a length clear by The Doves pub. [...] As both crews rowed into Chiswick Reach, they were struck by the {{headwind}} and by Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues had extended their lead by half a length, rating two strokes per minute more than Oxford. [...] By the time they passed below Barnes Bridge, Cambridge were seven seconds ahead. [...] They passed the finishing post with a lead of two and a quarter lengths in a time of 20 minutes 57 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 4440 in their favour. [...] It was the Light Blues' tenth consecutive victory, a record streak {{in the history of the}} event. [...] It was the slowest winning time since the 1925 race and the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race. [...] Writing in The Observer, William Beach Thomas declared that [...] "a good crew was beaten by a good crew after one of the finest races in the long chronicles". [...] According to the former Oxford rower E.P.Evans, [...] "the features of the race were the superb stroking of the Oxford crew by Holdsworth and the extremely bad coxing of the Cambridge boat ... although Cambridge won, they were not really at their best." ...|$|E
