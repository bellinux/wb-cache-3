25|$|A public authority's duties are {{generally}} imposed by legislation, which gives it discretion {{as to how}} to meet the objectives of the Act while working within a finite budget. The financial resources available to a public authority when making discretionary choices in respect of the performance of its duties {{may or may not be}} a relevant consideration depending on how the courts interpret the overall legislative scheme. In certain cases, a court <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the need for services cannot be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providing them, while in others the court might decide that financial resources are an irrelevant factor.|$|E

I think I <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> restful as the anger of middle-age sets in." [...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E
500|$|One {{can define}} other number systems using {{different}} rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs {{would need to}} be reinterpreted and one <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that,</b> in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of —rather than independent alternatives to— the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as [...] "0.999..." [...] is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then {{at least one of the}} assumptions built into the system must break down.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly {{the best thing that}} ever happened to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you play the game for a while, you just <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E
2500|$|One palpable {{description}} of the weed's effects is given by Gandalf to fellow wizard Saruman upon {{a meeting of the}} White Council: [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> smoke blown out cleared your mind of shadows within. Anyway, it gives patience, to listen to error without anger." [...] Although Saruman initially derided Gandalf for smoking, at some point he took up the habit himself. After the destruction of Saruman's fortress of Isengard, pipe-weed is found among its stores, but the Hobbits Merry and Pippin fail to realise the sinister implications of the discovery that Saruman has had commerce with the Shire.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{mean and}} median, {{the concept of}} mode also makes sense for [...] "nominal data" [...] (i.e., not {{consisting}} of numerical values {{in the case of}} mean, or even of ordered values in the case of median). For example, taking a sample of Korean family names, one <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Kim" [...] occurs more often than any other name. Then [...] "Kim" [...] would be the mode of the sample. In any voting system where a plurality determines victory, a single modal value determines the victor, while a multi-modal outcome would require some tie-breaking procedure to take place.|$|E

2500|$|A man {{who bought}} a slave abroad <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he had {{previously}} been stolen or captured from Babylonia; he would then have to restore him to his former owner without recompense. If he bought property belonging to a feudal holding, or to a ward in Chancery, he had to return {{it as well as}} forfeit what he paid for it. He could repudiate the purchase of a slave attacked by the bennu sickness within a month (later, a hundred days) and could hold a newly purchased female slave for three days [...] "on approval". A defect of title, or an undisclosed liability, would invalidate a sale at any time.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{arbitration}} clauses are not enforceable, and {{in other}} cases arbitration may {{not be sufficient to}} resolve a legal dispute. For example, disputes regarding validity of registered IP rights may need to be resolved by a public body within the national registration system. For matters of significant public interest that go beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement, such as [...] claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or committed civil rights violations, a court <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the parties may litigate some or all of their claims even before completing a contractually agreed arbitration process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{correlation}} is particularly noteworthy {{for the potential}} confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, {{as if they were}} connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, {{they may or may not}} be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See Correlation does not imply causation.) ...|$|E

Players {{will be able to}} explore uncharted star systems, and <b>might</b> <b>find</b> anomalies <b>that</b> open new resources and technologies, or uncharted planets offering random diplomatic or combat missions. In Season 2, a variety of missions in the Genesis system were added to the Diplomatic XP system, which over time grants non-combat missions, additional titles, and special items.|$|R

2500|$|Note that {{original}}ists {{would agree}} that, if the original {{meaning of the}} text could be ascertained, that meaning governs. Where they disagree, as in this example, is about exactly how to find that meaning. For example, any originalist or even a strict constructionist might apply the canon of construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which presumes that when an author includes one example he intends to exclude others. If that canon is appropriate in the example here, all originalist interpreters would likely reach the same result. Contrast this with a [...] "living constitutional" [...] interpretation, which <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that,</b> although the text itself only prohibits certain methods, those methods are examples of particularly unpleasant methods of execution; therefore, the text invites modern readers to extend its principle to those forms of punishment we now find particularly unpleasant.|$|E
2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{suggests that the}} nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and {{that the rate of}} adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect. According to the 2014 Miller's Anesthesia book, [...] "when compared with placebo, acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain". A 2012 meta-analysis conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found [...] "relatively modest" [...] efficiency of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it [...] "is more than a placebo" [...] and a reasonable referral option. Commenting on this meta-analysis, both Edzard Ernst and David Colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance. Edzard Ernst later stated that [...] "I fear that, once we manage to eliminate this bias [...] … we <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1925, {{after the}} death of the 15th Duke of Somerset, St. Maur petitioned the House of Lords Committee for Privileges to {{safeguard}} his claim to the Dukedom, in the hope <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> proof <b>that</b> his parents were married before his birth. On the death of his grandfather the 12th Duke in 1885, St Maur had been presumed to be illegitimate, and the Dukedom eventually passed to a distant branch of the family. He also placed advertisements in newspapers, offering a £50 reward for any witness to his parents' marriage.|$|R

This occurs because of similarities in the proteins of the pollen and the food. There are many cross-reacting substances.
