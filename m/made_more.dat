5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL).

To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were <b>made</b> <b>more</b> restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
