50|$|The {{concept of}} liquid roofing has existed since (at least) the early 1800s, when natural bitumen was {{combined}} with jute, straw, rag felt and other man made materials {{to provide a}} waterproofing solution for roofs. In {{the early twentieth century}} the manufacture of liquid roof coatings became a commercial activity, with the earliest coatings being based on liquefied rubber. The 1960s and 1970s saw the introduction of acrylics, acrylic emulsions, styrene butadienes and unsaturated polyesters, which led to improved quality and durability of the coatings. In 1975, the first water based elastomeric roof coatings were introduced. In the late 1980s, single component <b>moisture-cured</b> polyurethane coatings were developed and remain the basis of the majority of today's cold liquid applied roof coating technologies.|$|E
30|$|Difficult for the {{application}} of postcuring on wood adhesive bonds is that high temperatures can degrade the wood substrate, but for postcuring a relative high temperature is necessary. Small physical changes start with the emission of extractives at temperatures of around 40  °C [11]. Degradation starts with the hydrolysis of hemicellulosis in small amounts at 80  °C, followed by degradation of cellulose at 100  °C [11]. Thermal degradation of <b>moisture-cured</b> polyurethanes has also been reported to start at temperatures higher than 120  °C [12].|$|E
30|$|One {{advantage}} of the organic zinc-rich coatings over the inorganic zinc-rich coatings {{was reported to be}} a definable cure period based on external temperature and humidity conditions, which allows application of a top layer with confidence that the primer has fully cured (Williams 2012). This makes organic zinc-rich primers easier to apply in the field where the temperature and humidity cannot be regulated. Other coating systems based on a zinc-rich primer use a polyaspartic polyurethane, polyurethane, or polysiloxane topcoat. There are other coating types, namely <b>moisture-cured</b> urethanes, acrylic latexes, and epoxy resins, which may also be zinc-rich.|$|E
30|$|The one-part foam {{canister}} of {{the robot}} was almost empty after the ditch-filling experiment despite the higher construction capacity (volume of structures greater than 20 liters). The {{primary reason for}} this {{was the lack of}} reaction between the foam and the atmosphere, since one-part foam is a <b>moisture-cured</b> material. In both one-part foam experiments, even after 24 h, the foam was not completely cured. There was a slight material loss in the two-part foam process, because it cures by a chemical reaction. Based on the results of the experiments, two-part foam is a more efficient material for construction.|$|E
40|$|Cities and {{counties}} in Iowa {{have more than}} 8, 890 steel bridges, {{most of which are}} painted with red lead paint. The Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) maintains less than 35 bridges coated with red lead paint, including seven of the large border bridges over the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Because of the federal and state regulations for bridge painting, many governmental agencies have opted not to repaint, or otherwise maintain, lead paint coatings. Consequently, the paint condition on many of these bridges is poor, and some bridges are experiencing severe rusting of structural members. This research project was developed with two objectives: 1) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} preparing the structural steel surface of a bridge with high pressure water jetting instead of abrasive blasting and 2) to coat the structural steel surface with a <b>moisture-cured</b> polyurethane paint under different surface preparation conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and characterization {{of a kind}} of silane-terminated poly(ether-urethane) (PEU) -titania elastomeric hybrid for UV and X-ray shielding application. The hybrids can be easily synthesized by a <b>moisture-cured</b> sol-gel process at room temperature. Strong interactions between the organic and inorganic domains in these hybrids are obtained through the hydrolysis-condensation of the silane end group of the prepolymer with titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), which forms a 3 D hybrid network. These hybrids exhibit adjustable mechanical properties, in a range dependent on the organic/inorganic content ratio, e. g., the hybrid containing 40 wt% of TTIP exhibits 69. 3 % elongation at break and excellent resilience. They show intrinsic optical transparency and the ability to completely block UV radiation in the range of UV-B and UV-A 2, as well as excellent X-ray radiation blocking property. This study opens the possibility for using elastomeric coating and sealant in advanced personal protection equipments for shielding radiations. © 2010 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|E
40|$|Engineering robust {{adhesion}} of the junction-box (j-box) is a hurdle typically {{encountered by}} photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers during product development. There are historical incidences of adverse effects (e. g., fires) caused when the j-box/adhesive/module system has {{failed in the}} field. The addition of a weight to the j-box during the 'damp heat' IEC qualification test is proposed to verify the basic robustness of its adhesion system. The details of the proposed test will be described, {{in addition to the}} preliminary results obtained using representative materials and components. The described discovery experiments examine <b>moisture-cured</b> silicone, foam tape, and hot-melt adhesives used in conjunction with PET or glass module 'substrates. ' To be able to interpret the results, a set of material-level characterizations was performed, including thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis. PV j-boxes were adhered to a substrate, loaded with a prescribed weight, and then placed inside an environmental chamber (at 85 C, 85 % relative humidity). Some systems did not remain attached through the discovery experiments. Observed failure modes include delamination (at the j-box/adhesive or adhesive/substrate interface) and phase change/creep. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} application requirements, in addition to the plan for the formal experiment supporting the proposed modification to the qualification test...|$|E
30|$|The {{much greater}} {{challenge}} lay {{in any other}} part with larger dimensions and a much higher mass than the small sized sensors. Any mass {{was going to be}} accelerated by every blow of the pile driving process with a high number of repetitions. Initial information from previous investigations on pile driving of much smaller structures were reported to be in the region of up to 800 g (earth gravity) of acceleration. One solution to solve this problem is giving up the rigidity of the bond and giving way to several extra degrees of freedom and also profiting from the damping factor of soft semi-structural materials to ease the high-energy impacts on the adhesively bonded parts. The main strategy was to bond all heavy masses on a maximal surface area with a thick layer of soft semi-structural adhesive and also break down large structures into smaller pieces to avoid flexural interactions while moving under the accelerations and carry out free movements on the relatively thick polymer beddings. For an easy field application, a one-part <b>moisture-cured</b> polyurethane adhesive with a booster component, applied with a simple double cartridge (mixing ratio of 1 : 10) and static mixer was favoured. Laboratory tests were carried out to check the suitability of the chosen products on all related surfaces by using appropriate primer materials.|$|E
