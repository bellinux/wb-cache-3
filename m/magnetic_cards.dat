5|$|Previously, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) {{adopted a}} system to {{recirculate}} magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to {{a limited number of}} non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.|$|E

25|$|The Olivetti Programma 101 was {{introduced}} in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards.</b> It {{is regarded as the}} first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.|$|E

50|$|Optional input/output devices {{included}} a card reader and punch, a paper tape reader and punch, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> reader. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> reader used a large card (30 cm x 35 cm) {{with the top}} part used as a printer ledger. A 2.5 cm 4-track magnetic strip was {{across the bottom of}} the card.|$|R

25|$|Buses are the {{cheapest}} {{way to move}} around Natal. Passes or <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> can be purchased beforehand, but it is easiest to pay the conductor. There are large buses, micro buses and vans, driving along the same streets, charging the same fares.|$|E
25|$|Public {{telephone}} booths {{in countries with}} unstable currency were usually configured to accept tokens sold by the telephone company for variable prices. This system was in effect in Brazil until 1997 when <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> were introduced. The practice was also recently discontinued in Israel, leading to a trend of wearing the devalued tokens as necklaces.|$|E

2500|$|Tokens {{are being}} phased out by many casinos {{in favor of}} coinless {{machines}} which accept banknotes and print receipts for payout. (These receipts - often nicknamed [...] "TITOs" [...] for Ticket-in, ticket-out, can also be inserted into the machines.) In video arcades, they are also being phased {{out in favor of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards,</b> which can also count how many tickets one has, allowing arcades to also do away with paper tickets.|$|E
2500|$|IBM {{defined the}} term in a broad and vague way as [...] "the {{combination}} of people, procedures, and equipment which transforms ideas into printed communications," [...] and originally used it to include dictating machines and ordinary, manually operated Selectric typewriters. By the early seventies, however, the term was generally understood to mean semiautomated typewriters affording at least some form of editing and correction, {{and the ability to}} produce perfect [...] "originals." [...] Thus, the Times headlined a 1974 Xerox product as a [...] "speedier electronic typewriter", but went on to describe the product, which had no screen, as [...] "a word processor rather than strictly a typewriter, in that it stores copy on magnetic tape or <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> for retyping, corrections, and subsequent printout." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tollway has two sections: an {{open section}} and a closed section. The open section (within Metro Manila) charges a flat toll based on vehicle class and is {{employed}} {{to reduce the}} number of toll barriers (and associated bottlenecks) within the metropolis. The closed section is distance-based, charging based on the class of vehicle and distance traveled. When the expressway was modernized, an electronic toll collection system was set up for Class 1 vehicles while prepaid <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> were assigned to Class 2 and 3 vehicles to speed up transactions at toll booths. These have since been replaced by a unified ETC system operated by [...] As of October 1, 2011, all tolls (as shown below) include the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT).|$|E

2500|$|The {{operating}} {{system must be}} capable of distinguishing between requests which {{should be allowed to}} be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between [...] "privileged" [...] and [...] "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.|$|E

50|$|The {{military}} forces {{of a few}} nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass dials or cards instead of needles. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> compass is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the compass card while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo). <b>Magnetic</b> <b>card</b> compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool {{in order to take}} bearings directly from a map.|$|R
50|$|In January 2007, Moscow Metro began {{replacing}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> with contactless disposable tickets {{based on}} NXP's MIFARE Ultralight technology. Ultralight tickets {{are available for}} a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped 16 January 2008 and <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contact-less automatic fare-collection system.|$|E
