500|$|In a 1954 article, {{sports writer}} Dave Lewis wrote that Penn {{assigned}} five players {{to the task}} of mowing down Schulz. [...] Lewis quoted Schulz as having said: [...] "I can still see those five pairs of eyes staring at <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> we lined up... ready to tear me apart". [...] According to Lewis, all five men piled on Schulz every play, and Schulz held Penn scoreless for 50minutes before they [...] "finally knocked him out". [...] Lewis concluded: [...] "Never before or since has there been such a one-man show of defensive football as Schulz displayed against Penn".|$|E

500|$|On July 6, Sandoval hit {{his first}} career grand slam {{at home at}} AT Park against Sean West of the visiting Florida Marlins in a 54 victory. He hit his first home run into McCovey Cove on July 30, the 50th anniversary of the MLB Debut of Willie McCovey, who was in attendance. [...] Sandoval said after the game, [...] "It's special right now. I hit McCovey Cove and McCovey's here. He talks to <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> he's in the clubhouse." [...] Sandoval set a record for most hits by a Giants switch-hitter in a single season with 189 in 2009.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, Virginia Tech's defense was ranked third nationally in scoring defense (12.6points allowed per game), fourth in total defense (269.5total yards allowed per game) and fifth in pass defense (149.8passing yards allowed per game). The Tech defense featured two highly regarded cornerbacks, Jimmy Williams and Eric Green, who finished the regular season with 50tackles and 31tackles, respectively. Williams also had fourinterceptions (the most on the team), including one returned for a touchdown, and was named first-team All-ACC. Green, meanwhile, had one interception. Auburn wide receiver Courtney Taylor praised the two players highly in an interview before the game, saying, [...] "Those cornerbacks are amazing to <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> I look at them. I think, 'God, those guys are very athletic.' We're going to have our hands full." ...|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to <b>me.</b> <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what I would have done or said.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
