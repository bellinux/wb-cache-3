On the subject of name, Collins was quoted as saying [...] "I don't have any insight on the naming process that produced Libris Mortis. I don't know Latin and wasn't involved in selecting that name.

[...] The result was followed with four consecutive draws – three at home against Roma, Valencia and Ajax. Arsenal only needed a draw to progress into the knockout stages, but lost 2–1 to Valencia at the Mestalla on 19 March 2003.

The club {{qualified}} for the second group stage on goal difference but did not reach the quarter-finals, losing their final two matches against Deportivo La Coruña and Juventus. Having won the domestic league {{for the first time}} in four years, Wenger revealed the club's and his own intent to win the Champions League, telling French newspaper L'Equipe [...] "I can't imagine finishing my life without winning the European Cup". Arsenal began the following season impressively, winning 0–4 at PSV Eindhoven. The match set a new club record, as midfielder Gilberto Silva scored the fastest goal, in 20.07 seconds. Although Arsenal lost their last two matches against Borussia Dortmund and Auxerre, coinciding with a blip in form domestically, they qualified for the second group stage for the third consecutive season. Striker Thierry Henry scored his first hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; [...] "It's wonderful to score a hat-trick but it's even <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> I did so in a game we've won." [...] Arsenal failed to replicate their form at Roma, drawing their next four matches and losing to Valencia in the final match to finish third in their group and thus, out of the competition.|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 1770, {{a street}} {{confrontation}} resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians in {{what came to}} be known as the Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and had trouble finding legal representation. Adams ultimately agreed to defend them, though he feared that it would hurt his reputation. In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: [...] "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." [...] He also expounded upon Blackstone's Ratio: [...] "It is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." [...] Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.|$|E

Although labeled its art as [...] "silly", Sheena McNeil from Sequential Start expressed that [...] "it's smooth and nicely detailed with excellent expressions." [...] McNeil deemed Takei did [...] "a wonderful job of bringing shaman into the modern day but keeping it a story of fantasy". Ellingwood stated the series' [...] "vibrant action", [...] "imaginative plot twists and a creative world" [...] makes it [...] "a unique and stylish shōnen series." ...|$|E

After the arbitration of some minor differenced by the Bishop of Belley and the Abbot of Saint-Rambert, Rudolf did homage in an orchard below the castle at Saint-Rambert for his fiefs of Charousse, Cusy, Aubonne and Saint-Maurice-d'Agaune.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States the use or {{denial of}} use of current {{military}} aircraft in films {{is determined by the}} U.S. military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the U.S. military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get U.S. military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, [...] "This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts.

2500|$|The {{reliance}} on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, {{and is a}} significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action {{is likely to be}} lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As Justice Brandeis famously expressed it, [...] "in most matters it is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right." [...] This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law. For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their freedom of expression rights apply.|$|E
