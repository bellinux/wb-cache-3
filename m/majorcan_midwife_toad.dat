50|$|The <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes muletensis) (also Mallorcan {{midwife toad}} or ferreret in Balearic Catalan and Spanish) is a frog {{in the family}} Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae). It is endemic to the Balearic Island of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea. An example of Lazarus taxon, the species was first {{described}} from fossil remains in 1977, but living animals were discovered in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> has {{adapted to}} the harsh, dry {{conditions}} of this Spanish Island. it is found only in deep canyons in the northern mountains. Its body has evolved to become more flattened, which enables the toad to squeeze into narrow crevices in the rocks of its habitat. The only moisture available is in small, rain-filled puddles on ledges. Tadpoles are born and develop in these pools. Fossils of these species have also been found in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Kammerer {{succeeded in}} making <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> breed in the water by {{increasing}} the temperature of their tanks, forcing them to retreat to the water to cool off. The male <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> were not genetically programmed for underwater mating so over the span of two generations, Kammerer reported that his <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> were exhibiting black nuptial pads on their feet to give them more traction in this underwater mating process.|$|R
40|$|Distribution of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) in the canton Basel-Landschaft (NW Switzerland). The <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) {{is among}} the most {{strongly}} declining of Swiss amphibian species. This article documents the status of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in the canton of Basel-Landschaft in northern Switzerland. The survey showed that only a few known populations had gone locally extinct. Many hitherto unknown populations were reported for the first time. Most populations were very small. Regular counts of the number of calling males in the amphibian breeding sites of federal importance show that population counts fluctuated strongly but remained stationary over eight years. The distribution of a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) was also surveyed in order to assess whether it represents a threat for <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> populations in canton Basel-Landschaft. The chytrid fungus turned out to be widespread but there was no evidence for chytrid-associated population declines. Overall, the status of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in canton Basel-Landschaft is good. The canton should ensure that the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> remains widespread in its territory because the species is declining elsewhere in Switzerland...|$|R

5000|$|The species, {{considered}} [...] "vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN, {{is currently}} restricted to isolated mountain rivers in the island's Serra de Tramuntana {{and has an}} estimated population of 500 breeding pairs in the wild. It does exist and reproduce easily in captivity, however. The <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{is thought to have}} disappeared from most of the island {{as a result of the}} introduction of competitors and predators from the mainland in ancient times. Reintroduction of the species in additional areas has taken place since 1988, with many new breeding populations now well established.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1977 and {{was described as}} Baleaphryne muletensis. Only later the toad was accounted as a midwife toad. This {{was due to the}} fact that the species was thought extinct and was described from the fossil record. Later the species was 'rediscovered' in 1979 when froglets and young frogs were discovered. Currently the species is protected as a Majorcan endemic species, and breeding programs have been started to prevent the extinction of this species. The number of wild animals is estimated at around 300 to 700 breeding pairs. It was previously housed and bred at the Durrell Wildlife Park, with the goal of releasing into the wild, which was successful.|$|E
40|$|Males are {{expected}} to exhibit mating preferences when there is high variance {{in the quality of}} females or when males are limited to a small number of matings. In the <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad,</b> Alytes muletensis, the male performs parental care by carrying the eggs wrapped in a string around his hind legs. Both sexes possess courtship vocalizations which they use to advertise receptivity. We looked for evidence of male mating preferences in a phonotaxis arena in which males were presented with two alternative synthetic female calls. We predicted that males should prefer to mate with large females because of maternal effects on egg size, and that this preference would be manifest by selective phonotaxis toward low frequency calls. We also predicted that males should prefer high intensity calls as indicators of the energetic or motivational state of the female. Contrary to our prediction, males did not exhibit a preference for low frequency calls. The results suggest that there is stabilizing selection on call frequency and directional selection on call intensity...|$|E

50|$|Five {{separate}} {{species of}} <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca. Shy, nocturnal animals, they give away their presence by their ringing call. During the day, the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> hides under stones and logs or in underground tunnels. It often hides in dry, sandy soil, which it finds easier {{to dig into}} using its forelegs and snout. It emerges at dusk to forage for food, but always returns to the same hiding places before dawn. During the winter, the common <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> hibernates in its hole or in a burrow that has been deserted by a small animal.|$|R
50|$|The Iberian <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{or brown}} <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes cisternasii, in Spanish sapo partero ibérico) is {{a species of}} frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae) found in Portugal and western Spain. It is {{typically}} found in open habitats such as meadows and open oak forests. Habitat loss {{is one of the}} threats to its survival.|$|R
40|$|Female choice {{based on}} male call {{characteristics}} has been experimentally demonstrated {{in a number}} of species of anurans. In the <b>Majorcan</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad,</b> the male performs parental care by carrying the eggs in a string around his hind legs until they are ready to hatch. Both sexes produce calls to advertise sexual receptivity and both show phonotaxis towards the calls of the opposite sex. We used two-choice phonotaxis experiments to investigate whether females assess male caretaking ability using variation in call characteristics. Both call frequency and call duration are good indicators of male size, a characteristic that potentially influences the ability of males to successfully brood a clutch. Variation in call repetition rate and call intensity may also reflect differences in male caretaking ability, given the high energetic demands of calling behaviour in anurans. We predicted that females should prefer to mate with larger males and that this would be manifest in selective phonotaxis to low frequency and/or long duration calls. We also predicted that they would prefer calls produced at a fast rate and a high intensity. Contrary to our predictions females did not prefer lower frequency calls, longer calls or louder calls. They did however, selectively approach calls produced at a faster rate. These results are discussed in the context of sexual selection theory...|$|E

40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the alleged Lamarckian fraud of Paul Kammerer’s <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> experiments has intrigued generations of biologists. A re-examination of his descriptions of hybrid crosses of treated and nontreated toads reveals parent-of-origin effects like those documented in epigenetic inheritance. Modification of the extracellular matrix {{of the egg}} as described by Kammerer provides a plausible cause for altered gene methylation patterns. Traits such as altered egg and adult body size in Kammerer’s ‘‘treated’’ toads are inherited epigenetically in other tetrapods. A preliminary model involving the environmental silencing of a maternally inherited allele can be attempted to explain the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> experiments. Given available molecular tools and our current understanding of epigenetics, new experimentation with the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> is strongly encouraged.

50|$|The Trust has {{endangered}} the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in Spain {{by introducing}} the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The pathogen causes chytridiomycosis, {{which is now}} recognised as a principal driver of the mass extinction crisis in amphibians. The Trust's breeding facility in Jersey, {{that had been used}} for re-introduction of the species to its native habitat, has been identified as the source of chytridiomycosis which affects the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad.</b> It is the first case, where it could be shown that the anthropogenic movement of amphibians is spreading the fatal disease. The trust were however, successful in the mitigation of the impact of chytridiomycosis after a large scale re-introduction programme, and thanks to the work of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> became the only amphibian to be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable.|$|R

40|$|<b>Midwife</b> <b>toads</b> {{present one}} of the {{simplest}} calls in anurans, with the whole energy concentrated in a single band without frequency modulation. The tuning curves of the Iberian <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> Alytes cisternasii show the typical bimodal pattern in anurans, with two best excitatory frequencies at 0. 412 kHz (corresponding to the amphibian papilla) and at 1. 358 kHz (corresponding to the basilar papilla and matching the male call frequency). In this study, the hypothesis that complex calls arose in anurans because they were inherently more attractive to females, since they provided greater acoustic stimulation, was tested. However, our results indicate that splitting the call energy to stimulate both inner ear organs simultaneously, the male call is not more attractive to female <b>midwife</b> <b>toads,</b> but sometimes renders it unattractive.
