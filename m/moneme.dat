50|$|While Knowles {{experienced}} considerable {{success with}} the Wave, he had frequent disagreements with the Wave’s ownership. This led to his expressing {{a desire to be}} traded. On December 26, 1996, the Wave acquiesced to Knowles desires and traded him to the Cleveland Crunch for Glenn Carbonara, Todd Dusosky, Obi <b>Moneme</b> and cash. He was injured while in Cleveland and saw little playing time. On July 29, 1997, Knowles bought out the remaining three years of his contract with the Crunch and {{signed as a free agent}} with the Philadelphia KiXX. In the 1997-1998 season, his first in Philadelphia, Knowles experienced a resurgence which led to his third Defender of the Year award. After one more season with the KiXX, Knowles moved to the Detroit Rockers. Knowles played two seasons in Detroit before the Rockers folded at the end of the 2000-2001 season.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with {{a description of}} the morphological and syntactic analyses of the predicative aspectual phenomena in Modern Standard Arabic using Axiomatic Functionalism as its theoretical framework. The thesis consists of an introduction, three major parts, and a conclusion. The introduction deals with a brief overview of the Axiomatic Functionalist theory. Part one, which comprises four chapters, offers a brief account of the theoretical background of this work as well as presenting the predicative (verbal and non-verbal) aspectual phenomena in MSA. Chapter I discusses the term 'aspect', and the relation between lexical and grammatical aspect. Chapter II discusses the Arabic language, particularly the category of 'aspect'. Chapter III discusses the interaction between punctuality and aspect. Chapter IV is exclusively devoted to methodology; it explains an explanation of the essential and relevant theoretical notions in grammar, uniting the description to the theory. It also provides a step-by-step application of successive criteria for discriminating between morphological complexes and syntactic complexes. The second part (Chaps. V & VI), deals with morphological analysis. Chapter V analyses the category of verb in Arabic. For this purpose the following paradigms are set up: Verb-root, Aspect, Voice, Person, Gender, and Number. Each of these contains <b>monemes</b> which which are constituents of the verbal entity. These <b>monemes</b> commute with each other yielding a difference in the message conveyed. The chapter concludes that entities of the verb category in Arabic may contain the constituent <b>monemes</b> verb-root, perfective, imperfective, active, passive, first person, second person, third person, masculine, feminine, singular, dual, and plural. Chapter VI deals with the realisational as pect of the constituent <b>monemes</b> of the complex pleremes in chapter V. It also deals with the distribution of the allomorphs of the constituent <b>monemes</b> in question. Part three (Chaps. VII - IX), deals with the syntactic description of the aspectual phenomena in MSA. Chapter VII sets up the distributional unit (model) which accounts for the relations within the VPB syntagm. This chapter tests the adequacy of the model by establishing all the VPB syntagms which map onto it. These syntagms vary according to the type of the verbal nucleus in each of them, (transitive or intransitive and of what kind). It further deals with types of non-verbal nucleus I and the realisations of the predicative based syntagms (verbal and non-verbal). Chapter VIII deals in detail with the syntactic relations within the predicative syntagms. It also deals with the syntactic structures of various as pectual phenomena in MSA. Chapter IX discusses the syntactic relation within the functional syntagm in MSA which may form an immediate constituent in a predicative based syntagm. A final brief 'Conclusion' points out the need for further research and development in Axiomatic Functionalism in the field of "semantic syntagm-analysis"...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{syntactic}} {{functions in the}} sentence as relations that can be represented {{in the way of}} metalinguistic signs. We propose the definition of these sign functions from a double perspective: on the one hand, considering their relations to the sentence unit, getting this way its definition as categories of functions; on the other hand, their relations to other sentence functions. From this perspective, we will obtein their characterization as classes of functions. The analysis of these syntactical functions {{from this point of view}} implies the extension of the traditional concept of linguistic significant beyond a mere phonic nature, so that we will consider as significants of categories and classes of functions, respectively, certain articulations of <b>monemes</b> and the compatibility with other functional classes...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-defined}} poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) brushes were grafted {{from the}} surfaces of the activated carbon (AC) powder with the controlled/"living" radical polymerization technique. First, surface functional groups of the AC powder were homogenized to hydroxyl groups by oxidizing with nitric acid and then reducing with lithium tetrahydroaluminate (LiAlH 4) at first. Second, the surface hydroxyl groups were treated with bromoacetylbromide, and the bromoacetyl groups were introduced. And in the third step, the bromoacetyl activated carbon (BrA-AC) powder were used as macro-initiators for the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) {{in the presence of}} 1, 10 -phenanthroline and Cu(I) Br as catalyst in a water system. The graft parameters calculated from the elemental analyses (EA) results, conversion of <b>monemer</b> (C%) and percentage of grafting (PG%) were 5. 74 % and 28. 7 %, respectively, after polymerizing for 5 h. The graft polymerizations exhibited the characteristics of a controlled/"living" polymerization, and no homopolymer was found in the proposed polymerizing process. The preparation procedure of the poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) grafted activated carbon (PHEA-AC) powder was also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PHEA-AC powder is expected to be used as selective adsorbents because of their abundant homogenized surface hydroxyl groups.

He {{spent two}} seasons in Baltimore, but was released before the 1990-1991 season. In October 1990, Carbonara {{signed with the}} San Diego Sockers. [...] That season, the Sockers won the league championship while Carbonara was named the Championship Series Unsung Hero. [...] The Sockers released him during the off-season and Carbonara joined the Illinois Thunder of the National Professional Soccer League. In 1992, Carbonara moved to the Cleveland Crunch. In 1993, the Crunch won the NPSL title, giving Carbonara his second of his career. On December 27, 1996, the Crunch traded Carbonara, Obi <b>Moneme,</b> and Todd Dusosky to the Milwaukee Wave for Matt Knowles. [...] Carbonara remained with the Wave until 2002. In 2001, he was named the NPSL Defender of the Year. On July 24, 2002, the Philadelphia KiXX purchased Carbonara's contract from the Wave. [...] He played one season, then retired. Carbonara ended his career playing in 10 championship series winning 6 ( [...] 1 with the San Diego Sockers, 2 with the Cleveland Crunch and 3 with the Milwaukee Wave). Carbonara was also a six time all- star in the MISL/NPSL/MSL.|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this article}} are to {{undertake}} a study, based upon an analysis of linguistic terms such as <b>moneme,</b> morpheme, semantics, semasiology, onomasiology, signification, etc., of how certain lexical relationships in this terminological field are presented, and to reflect upon the special semantic characteristics of this technical lexicon {{in relation to the}} principles which govern other scientific terminologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to explore the {{possibility}} of testing hypotheses for <b>moneme</b> identity by using an additional criterion of adequation with respect to semantic factors: a criterion concerning the assumption of recoverability of denotations of complex pleremes from the denotations of their constituents. I have taken the position that, in the final analysis, a particular complex plereme is a combination of two or more monemes holds on condition that the overall denotation of the complex in question is recoverable from the denotations of its constituents, plus, of course, from having a relatively clear (though necessarily rather approximate) idea of the semantic role played by the constructional relation between these constituents...|$|E
