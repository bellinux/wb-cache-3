25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and <b>my</b> <b>clients.</b> It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
500|$|Systemic {{consequences}} were felt, as Enron's creditors {{and other}} energy trading companies suffered {{the loss of}} several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could. The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, [...] "We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> {{to prepare for the}} worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Nikolai Polozov {{said that}} both Tolokonnikova and Samutsevich were also {{members of the}} Voina group, and both had previously staged disruptive protests in the Tagansky Court building, {{where they would be}} judged. He argued that their two previous attempts to disrupt proceedings would bias the judge, and preclude a fair outcome at that location. [...] "I believe that the judge will certainly remember <b>my</b> <b>clients,</b> and could easily take offense to it, and therefore could not make an objective decision". The three detained members of Pussy Riot were declared political prisoners by the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners (SPP). On March 25, Amnesty International named them prisoners of conscience due to [...] "the severity of the response of the Russian authorities".|$|E

Butler and on behalf of <b>my</b> <b>client,</b> Jeff Crosland, I hereby join in the February 1, 1995 Petition for Writ of Certiorari of Todd Crosland, a co-defendant in the matter, and adopt as <b>my</b> <b>client</b> 2 ̆ 7 s own, the arguments contained in that Petition for Writ of Certiorari...|$|R

2500|$|Peto, Betts and Crampton {{admitted}} to owing the LCDR £365,000 {{and eventually the}} railway acquiesced to this figure. The railway’s new solicitors declared, [...] "Whether <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> had a proof upon the proceedings for £360,000 or for £6,600,000, the result would, unfortunately be the same – in neither case would there be any dividend." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette commented, [...] "… the chase was costly and the game worthless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, {{asked me}} to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly and then said, [...] "As you know, I am {{attorney}} for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among <b>my</b> <b>clients.</b> They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution." [...] He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.|$|E

2500|$|... {{representatives from}} the ten banks of Little Rock, had {{declined}} to make a loan to the city. When Brickhouse mentioned this fact to Jones, Jones he asked the mayor how much money the city needed. The mayor replied that he needed $75,000; [...] Jones said, [...] "My clients have $120,000 on deposit in the banks of Little Rock and if the Clearing House will not let you have the money, <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> will." [...] After hearing about the conversation, the Clearing House agreed to lend the city the $75,000.|$|E
2500|$|Former gallery dealers {{also charged}} that the company used Christianity {{as a tool to}} take {{advantage}} of people. [...] "They really knew how to bait the hook," [...] said one ex-dealer {{who spoke on condition of}} anonymity. [...] "They certainly used the Christian hook." [...] One former dealer's lawyer stated, [...] "Most of <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> got involved with Kinkade because it was presented as a religious opportunity. [...] Being defrauded is awful enough, but doing it in the name of God is really despicable." [...] On June 2, 2010, Pacific Metro, the artist's production company, filed for , one day after defaulting on a $1 million court-imposed payment to the aforementioned Karen Hazlewood and Jeffrey Spinello. A $500,000 payment had previously been disbursed.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Bentham {{regarded}} him with stony face. [...] "There are certain points," [...] he said, [...] "upon which I cannot enlighten you. My duty to <b>my</b> <b>client</b> forbids it. I cannot describe {{to you the}} nature of those securities. I cannot suggest where you should look for them. All that I {{can say is that}} they are still to be found, and that <b>my</b> <b>client</b> is still a buyer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Admiral. We shall do you a {{beautiful}} houseful at that sum. It is {{the custom of}} <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> to take half in furniture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm getting old, and <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> {{are few and}} unimportant, {{aside from}} the Elmhurst interests," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I can manage to go abroad with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{order to}} prove," [...] he announced, [...] "how entirely devoid <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> are of {{mercenary}} considerations, they agree, Mr. Bundercombe, {{to accept the}} sum of four thousand pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{difference}} {{being that}} your client by his fault has jeopardised his own interests {{and those of}} <b>my</b> <b>client,</b> while <b>my</b> <b>client</b> has not been in fault at all. I shall bring the matter forward before the Lord Mayor to-morrow, and as at present advised shall ask for an investigation with reference to a charge of fraud. I presume you will be served with a subpoena to bring the letter into court.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aren't you {{a little}} premature? <b>My</b> <b>clients</b> don't usually plead poverty until I send in my bill," [...] was the answer. [...] "You own a tolerably {{extensive}} holding in Crane Valley, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I regret," [...] he said, [...] "that I cannot {{offer you}} chairs. I am not {{accustomed}} to receive <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> here. If you care to be seated upon that form, pray do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] {{said the}} {{barrister}} to his companion, [...] "I remember that poor fellow's face; you spoke more truly {{than you were}} aware of; he really is one of <b>my</b> <b>clients,</b> poor man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crocker," [...] said <b>my</b> <b>client</b> to me, afterwards, [...] "they didn't {{feel like}} the real, {{home-grown}} article. But aren't they damned handsome?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{suspect in}} the case, Victor Mlimi, deputy {{director}} of the Mpumalanga housing department, was according to his lawyer, Daniel Mabunda, questioned for two hours about the ANC's provincial leadership squabbles and where his own allegiances lie: [...] "I was present when <b>my</b> <b>client</b> was asked, 'Are you destroying the image and integrity of the ANC in Mpumalanga?' I advised <b>my</b> <b>client</b> not to answer that question. It struck me that this {{has more to do with}} politics than a criminal case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. No one does. But it was Mr. M'Leod's fancy--his wife's rather, I believe; {{and since}} we could meet it--it was my duty to <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> at {{whatever}} cost to my own feelings--to make him pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} {{understand}} that the war has made money tight. <b>My</b> <b>clients</b> inform me that they find themselves compelled to press for outstanding accounts and to take a course that in a happier state of things they would not employ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Nevis, {{and there}} was something significant in his manner; [...] "I thought it wiser to look up <b>my</b> <b>clients</b> after the hail we had two nights ago. It's going to make things very tight for many of the prairie farmers." ...|$|E
60|$|Marian and I {{were married}} {{the very next}} month, October, at <b>my</b> <b>client's</b> {{palatial}} residence of Mohair. This was at Mr. Cooke's earnest wish: and since Marian was Mrs. Cooke's own niece, and an orphan, there seemed no good reason why <b>my</b> <b>client</b> should not be humored in the matter. As for Marian and me, we did not much care whether we were married at Mohair or the City of Mexico. Mrs. Cooke, I think, had a secret preference for Germantown.|$|R
