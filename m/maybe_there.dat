When asked about the album, he stated: [...] The rapper commented on the album's perception before its release, saying, [...] "I know everybody was expecting gang-bang, 40-ounce, low-rider music, but that's not what I gave them... I'm telling a real story, and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> {{are people out there}} who can relate to my experiences." [...] Rolling Stone observed that [...] "every song has a well-massaged hook and some immediate appeal, and verses that don't waste a lot of time getting to the point." ...|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D’Esposito later {{stated that}} Marvel was {{considering}} {{the idea of}} introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There’s always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can’t all be at the same level. So <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off. I could see that happening." [...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that. If Iron Man is flying around doing something, that [...] very costly. And first of all, what’s the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Marvel {{announced}} {{a series of}} direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said [...] "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a {{way for us to}} expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features." [...] Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There's always a potential to introduce a character.

500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don’t know why. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> was a little spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half}} of 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E

I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

500|$|After {{his death}} Sibelius, though {{remaining}} {{popular with the}} general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as [...] "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity {{about the existence of}} material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked [...] "VIII" [...] within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that [...] "ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just waiting for some scholar to discover them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy.

I mean I think they're a good band. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to me.

2500|$|In 1974, the IAA {{removed a}} sixth-century Byzantine mosaic from Gaza City, dubbed 'King David Playing the Lyre', {{which is now}} in the synagogue section of the Israel Museum. According to Jerusalem Post, it is illegal for an occupying power to remove ancient {{artifacts}} from the land it occupies, but Israel maintains that the Palestinians {{have not been able to}} safeguard antiquities in the areas under their control, where looting is common. In the past, looted items have been sold to Israelis. Hananya Hizmi, deputy of Israel's Department of Antiquities in Judea and Samaria, explained, [...] "Probably it was done to preserve the mosaic. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> was an intention to return [...] and it didn't work out.

2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying {{up and down the street}} in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me.

[...] At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added [...] "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close." [...] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that [...] "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure.

Kinoy deleted certain characters, including two of the Hutchinsons' three children, and added at least one character, John Gunderson, a schoolteacher who publicly objects to the lottery being held, and at first refuses to draw. Finally, Kinoy included an ending scene describing the townspeople's post-lottery activities, and an afterword in which the narrator suggested, [...] "Next year, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> won't be a Lottery.

2500|$|When {{asked by}} Han Shizhong on what crime Yue had committed, Qin Hui replied, [...] "Though it isn't sure {{whether there is}} {{something}} that he did to betray the dynasty, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> is." [...] The phrase [...] "perhaps there is" [...] or [...] "could be true" [...] ( [...] , often mistranslated from Ancient to Contemporary Chinese as [...] "you committed no crime") has entered the Chinese dictionary as an expression to refer to fabricated charges. Decades later, his grandson, Yue Ke (岳珂), had retrieved documentary evidence of his grandfather's achievements, and published an adulatory biography of him. [...] Emperor Xiaozong eventually posthumously [...] pardoned and rehabilitated Yue. For their part in Yue's death, iron statues of Qin Hui, Lady Wang, and two of Qin's subordinates, Moqi Xie (万俟卨) and Zhang Jun (張俊), were made to kneel before Yue Fei's tomb (located by the West Lake, Hangzhou). For centuries, these statues have been cursed, spat and urinated upon by people.
