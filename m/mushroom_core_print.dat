25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two <b>core</b> <b>prints</b> in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one <b>core</b> <b>print</b> so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Thermal contact {{resistance}} {{is one of}} key technologies for heat transfer of high power light emitting diodes (LED) packaging. In this paper, based on the resistance network model of LED packaging, a 3 -D finite element simulation model (FEM) is established and thermal transient testing experiments are also performed by Thermal Transient tester (T 3 Ster). Experiment date indicates thermal {{contact resistance}} for 48 % of the total thermal resistance. The thermal interface material (TIM) layer of high power LED packaging is studied to analysis thermal contact resistance which impacts on thermal performance of LED packaging. The total thermal resistance and the thermal resistance of TIM layer are separately calculated from simulation and experiment. To the resistance of TIM layer, the result of experiment is only a 1 % error compared to the result of FEM simulation. Therefore, The FEM simulation and experiment are mutually validated. In order to thoroughly study on thermal contact resistance, {{based on the principle}} of structure function, thermal resistance of three different types of TIM layer between metal <b>core</b> <b>printed</b> circuit board (MCPCB) and aluminum heat sink are measured and compared.

Using an accurate electric model, the cell temperature and efficiency are determined together with the CPV/T module electric and thermal powers. Generally, the CPV system size is realized according to the user electric load demand and, then, it is important to evaluate the necessary minimum concentration ratio (Cmin), the limit of CPV system applicability, {{in order to determine the}} energy convenience profile.

The configuration of the module is optimized with genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a response surface methodology. The space between chips, {{the thickness of the}} metal <b>core</b> <b>printed</b> circuit board (MCPCB), and the thickness of the base plate are considered as three optimal parameters, while the total thermal resistance (R tot) is considered as a single objective function. After optimizing objectives with GA, the optimal design parameters of three types of MC LED modules are determined. The results show that the thickness of MCPCB has a stronger influence on the total thermal resistance than other parameters. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is performed based on the optimum data. It reveals thatR tot increases with the increased thickness of MCPCB, and reduces as the space between chips increases. The effect of the thickness of base plate is far less than that of the thickness of MCPCB. After optimization, three types of MC LED modules obtain lower T j andR tot. Moreover, the optimized modules can emit large luminous energy under high-power input conditions. Therefore, the optimization results are of great significance in the selection of configuration parameters to improve the performance of the MC LED module. </p...|$|R

40|$|Casting {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} metal-shaping methods known to human being. It generally means pouring molten metal into a refractory mold with a cavity of the shape to be made, and allowing it to solidify. When solidified, the desired metal object is taken out from the refractory mold either by breaking the mold or by taking mold apart. This process is also called founding. A pattern is a replica of the object to be made by the casting process, with some modifications. The main modifications are addition of pattern allowances like shrinkage allowance, machining allowance, draft allowance etc., the provision of <b>core</b> <b>prints</b> and elimination of fine details. Loose piece pattern is used when the contour of the part is such that withdrawing the pattern from the mold is not possible. Hence during molding, the obstructing part of the contour is held as a loos piece by a wire. After molding is over, first the main pattern is removed and then the loose pieces are recovered through the gap generated by the main pattern. A safety valve which is generally manufactured by complex forging method, can be easily manufactured by sand casting method which is more economical the forging method. In the sand casting method, the two wedge shaped portions of the safety valve create problem during removal of pattern, so these two portions are taken as loose pieces and held as loose pieces by a wire or pin. Once the main pattern body is removed, these loose pieces are recovered through the space vacated by main pattern body. So this project work deals with manufacturing of safety valve using sand casting with split pattern which consists of multi loose pieces (combined loose piece) and its advantages over complex forging metho...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, {{there was}} a further {{investigation}} on this phenomenon. Instead of a high-voltage LED chip, a GaN-based low-voltage LED chip was also examined in this case. This chip can withstand {{a wider range of}} applied currents and facilitate more precise power change for observing the thermal inductive responses. The chip was mounted on a lead frame and encapsulated with silicone. The chip package was soldered to a metal <b>core</b> <b>printed</b> circuit board and mounted on a thermal plate with controllable temperatures. The transient junction temperature of the LED chip as a function of time was measured with the applied current as different step down functions. They calculated that the junction temperature is equal to 36.2 °C at 350 mA in this situation. The results are consistent with the previous thermal inductive measurement in the GaN-based high-voltage LED chip. As expected, the junction temperatures immediately rise and gradually decrease as the currents are stepped down. And the recovery time is slower for the system with a larger step level decrease. They prove that a rapid changing power through the GaN-based LEDs induces a proportional temperature change, which is opposed to the temperature change expected from the power input. This phenomenon is referred as thermal inductance in the report. The thermal inductive properties could be related to the thermoelectric effect, especially the transient thermoelectric effect. However, rather than considering the specified structure of thermoelectric devices, it is considered that the thermal inductance that occurs in GaN devices with a p-n junction. With the combination of the thermal resistance, the thermal capacitance, and the thermal inductance, it is expected that their assumption can promote the thermal analysis of high-frequency GaN devices. In addition, it is expected that thermal inductance phenomena exist more widely exist in nonhomogeneous materials and in the field of thermal analysis under energy changes in very short duration.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{concentrator}} solar cells operating under concentration experience a number of physical effects which affect their performances. In particular, ohmic losses can determine a noticeable performance worsening of concentrator solar cells. The goal of this dissertation is to develop a distributed electrical model of solar cell in order to simulate the operation of concentrator solar cells in a number of working conditions characteristic of Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) systems, such as uneven illumination profiles with arbitrary spectral distributions. To this end a mixed optical-electrical simulation tool has been developed in order to assess the performances of a typical concentrator solar cell in the case of illumination provided by different kinds of concentrators; in particular a Fresnel lens, a parabolic mirror and a freeform mirror have been considered and compared. At high concentration factors front contact grid pattern has a key role in extracting photogenerated charges, and hence it is another factor that can strongly affect the cell performances; for this reason the above mentioned distributed electrical model has also been applied to the assessment of ohmic losses impact on concentrator silicon solar cells performances in the presence of different kinds of front contact grid patterns.

In recent years, light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become an attractive technology for general and automotive illumination systems. LEDs have been preferable for automobile lighting due to its numerous advantages such as long life, low power consumption, optical control and light quality as well as robustness for high vibration. Thermal management {{is one of the main}} issues due to severe ambient conditions and compact volume. Conventionally, tightly packaged double sided FR 4 based printed circuit boards are utilized for both driver electronics components and LEDs. In fact, this approach will be a leading trend for advanced Internet of Things (IOT) applications in near future. A series of numerical models are developed to determine the local temperature distribution on both sides of a light engine. Results showed that FR 4 PCB has a temperature gradient of over 63 °C while the maximum temperature is 105 °C. This causes a significant degradation of lifetime and lumen extraction as many LEDs are recommended to be operated below 100 °C. In addition to FR 4, Aluminum metal core and vapor chamber based advanced heat spreader substrates are developed to obtain thermal impact on the substrate due to a wide range of thermal conductivity of three boards. To mimic real application, two special flex circuits are developed for LEDs and driver circuit. 10 red and 6 amber LEDs at one flex-PCB, and driver components are populated on the other flex-PCB are mounted. Both flex circuits are attached each side of the substrate. Experimental results showed that the local hotspots occurred at FR 4 PCB due to low thermal conductivity.
