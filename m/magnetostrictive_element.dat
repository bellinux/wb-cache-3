40|$|Recent {{advances}} in phase transition transduction enabled {{the design of}} a non-resonant broadband mechanical energy harvester that is capable of delivering an energy density per cycle up to two orders of magnitude larger than resonant cantilever piezoelectric type generators. This was achieved in a [011] oriented and poled domain engineered relaxor ferroelectric single crystal, mechanically biased to a state just below the ferroelectric rhombohedral (FR) -ferroelectric orthorhombic (FO) phase transformation. Therefore, a small variation in an input parameter, e. g., electrical, mechanical, or thermal will generate a large output due to the significant polarization change associated with the transition. This idea was extended in the present work to design a non-resonant, multi-domain magnetoelectric composite hybrid harvester comprised of highly magnetostrictive alloy, [Fe 81. 4 Ga 18. 6 (Galfenol) or TbxDy 1 -xFe 2 (Terfenol-D) ], and lead indium niobate–lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate (PIN-PMN-PT) domain engineered relaxor ferroelectric single crystal. A small magnetic field applied to the coupled device causes the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>element</b> to expand, and the resulting stress forces the phase change in the relaxor ferroelectric single crystal.

40|$|We present new {{results in}} {{physical}} analysis of acoustical SAW- based (Love- wave) resonators and magnetoelastic microsensors in biofluidic applications where the negligible amount of biomolecular material can be monitored in situ in a liquid phase. We reported the exact {{solution of the}} dispersion equation of surface acoustic waves (SAW) of Love type for the first type of resonators and demonstrate the importance of size effects in magnetoelastic resonators never taken into account before in such systems. Our results can readily {{be applied to the}} correct interpretation of resonance frequency and quality factor changes measured in various biofluidic applications. Our choice of the resonators has been motivated by the following. SAW-based microsensors operate at high frequency (up to GHz) which is a great benefit for monitoring of mass since the measurable signal, the shift in phase velocity ΔV/V, is ~ω. The Love wave polarization corresponds to the no-slip conditions for example, when the biomolecular coating material is covalently bound to the substrate.

The laminae are a single transversely polarized piezoelectric elements (PZ 29) sandwiched between two longitudinal-magnetic ally polarized <b>magnetostrictive</b> TD <b>elements</b> (Terfenol-D-TX GMM). The direct ME effect was determined by measuring laminate output with a Helmholtz-generated AC field (up to 7 Oe) in the range 50 Hz- 100 kHz biased by a DC field (0 - 1000 Oe). Peak voltage output occurred at the sample's mechanical resonant frequency, its value depending on the strength {{and direction of the}} applied magnetic field. The peak output was 3061 mV at 3 Oe AC field and 1000 Oe bias, equivalent to 74. 4 V cm(- 1) Oe(- 1). The peak output coefficient, however, was 93. 6 V cm(- 1) Oe(- 1) at 0. 1 Oe AC field and 1000 Oe DC bias. The reduction at higher drive amplitudes was attributed to increased Young's modulus of the TD phase. Anomalous peaks in the low frequency spectrum of sample's output are explained. The converse magnetoelectric effect was measured by recording the voltage induced in a solenoid encompassing the ME while exposed to a DC bias field and the PZ phase driven by a 10 VAC source. The peak output is shown to depend on the strength of the applied DC magnetic field and developed a maximum field of 15. 4 Oe at the sample's mechanical resonant frequency.

The current trends to overcome this situation point towards Energy Harvesting technology. These harvesters (or scavengers) store the energy from sources present in the ambient (as wind, solar, electromagnetic, etc) and are costless for us. Piezoelectric devices {{are the ones that}} show a higher power density, and materials as ceramic PZT or polymeric PVDF have already demonstrated their ability to act as such energy harvester elements. Combinations between piezoelectric and electromagnetic mechanism have been also extensively investigated. Nevertheless, the power generated by these combinations is limited under the application of small magnetic fields, reducing the performance of the energy harvester [1]. In the last years the appearance of magnetoelectric (ME) devices, in which the piezoelectric deformation is driven by the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>element,</b> enables to extract the energy of very small electromagnetic signals through the generated magnetoelectric voltage at the piezoelectric element.

For cryogenic temperature applications {{the use of}} superconducting magnets offer {{the possibility of a}} persistent mode of operation, i. e., the magnetostrictive material will maintain a strain field without power. High temperature superconductors (HTS) are attractive options if the temperature of operation is higher than 10 degrees Kelvin (K) and below 77 K. However, HTS wires have constraints that limit the minimum radius of winding, and even if good wires can be produced, the technology for joining superconducting wires does not exist. In this paper, the design and capabilities of a rare earth zinc magnetostrictive actuator using bulk HTS is described. Bulk superconductors can be fabricated in the sizes required with excellent superconducting properties. Equivalent permanent magnets, made with this inexpensive material, are persistent, do not require a persistent switch as in HTS wires, and can be made very small. These devices are charged using a technique which is similar to the one used for charging permanent magnets, e. g., by driving them into saturation. A small normal conducting coil can be used for charging or discharging. Because of the magnetic field capability of the superconductor material, a very small amount of superconducting magnet material is needed to actuate the rare earth zinc. In this paper, several designs of actuators using YBCO and BSCCO 2212 superconducting materials are presented. Designs that include magnetic shielding to prevent interaction between adjacent actuators will also be described.

Especially when the filler material is in nanometer size, it offers extra degrees of freedom with which physical properties can be manipulated to obtain new functionalities. Such materials are known as nanocomposites. For instance the electrical conductivity of nanocomposite film depends on the inter particle separation and can be varied from insulating to metallic by metal volume fraction. This dependency can be utilized to design sensors in the field of gas sensing and strain sensing. Thus the aim of this thesis is preparation, characterization of polymer and ceramic nanocomposites through vapor phase deposition process and most importantly according to the application needed. The chosen preparation method allows one to control and vary the composition and filling factor which are of prime importance to tailor the functional properties. The focus of the thesis is the application of these nanocomposites as strain sensor, tunnel magnetoresistance and as a high frequency core material. A hybrid system was developed which uses quasi dimensional metal/polymer composite to monitor the magnetostriction through quantum tunneling. Magnetically induced strain in the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>element</b> is transferred to assembly of Au nanoparticle by mechanical coupling. This magnetically induced strain leads to changes in interparticle separation in the nanoparticle assembly, giving rise to a change in tunneling current between the metal nanoparticles thus enabling simple electrical read out of the strain. The functional layer should be able to transfer to any substrate easily. The presence of polymer is an added advantage when the substrate is conductive as is the case here. Further, ceramic (TiO 2, SiO 2) based magnetic nanocomposites where ferromagnetic alloy (FeCo) nanoparticles are embedded in ceramic matrix were developed. The composites were characterized in terms microstructure and magnetic properties with respect to metal volume fraction. The magnetization process is strongly related to metal volume fraction. Films show superparamagnetic behavior up to the percolation threshold suggesting presence of non interacting single domain superparamagnetic particles where as at higher volume fraction show hysteresis characters. Considerable room temperature tunnel magnetoresistance was observed below the percolation threshold.

The work presented herein explores the effects of anisotropic energy application to further enhance the coupled behavior of such systems and enable applications such as thermal energy harvesting, electrically small antennas, energy efficient memory, and microscale actuators. Four types of anisotropy are presented: magnetocrystalline, electoelastic, magnetoelastic and shape, which are utilized in joint and competing fashions to deterministically control magnetic and electric states at micro and nanoscales. First, a study is performed to determine the most efficient and energy dense way to trasduce thermal energy into magnetic energy by leveraging single domain magnetic states and the temperature dependence of magentocrystalline anisotropy. A numeric case study is performed which shows that gadolinium and neodymium cobalt are capable of 30 % and 22 % relative efficiencies, respectively, which is a significant improvement over {{the state of the}} art thermoelectric efficiency of 15 %. Second, design and testing of an electrically small multiferroic receiver antenna is performed to show the efficient transduction of EM radiation in the HF and VHF frequency spectrums to electrical power in structures which are five orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in free-space.

Main emphasis is put on the modeling of the considered mechatronic systems for applications {{in the field of}} power harvesting from vibrations, namely vibration-to-electric energy conversion, using novel giant magnetostrictive materials. Mathematical model of the considered mechatronic system has been developed.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} {{are widely used}} in aerospace, mechanical, civil and other industries because of their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. However, composite structures are highly prone to impact damage. Possible types of defect or damage in composite include matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination between plies. In addition, delamination in a laminated composite is usually invisible. It is very diffcult to detect it while the component is in service and this will eventually lead to catastrophic failure of the structure. Such damages {{may be caused by}} dropped tools and ground handling equipments. Damage in a composite structure normally starts as a tiny speckle and gradually grows with the increase in load to some degree. However, when such damage reaches a threshold level, serious accident can occur. Hence, {{it is important to have}} up-to-date information on the integrity of the structure to ensure the safety and reliability of composite components, which require frequent inspections to identify and quantify damage that might have occurred even during manufacturing, transportation or storage. How to identify a damage using the obtained information from a damaged composite structure is one of the most pivotal research objectives. Various forms of structural damage cause variations in structural mechanical characteristics, and this property is extensively employed for damage detection. Existing traditional non-destructive inspection techniques utilize a variety of methods such as acoustic emission, C-scan, thermography, shearography and Moir interferometry etc. Each of these techniques is limited in accuracy and applicability. Most of these methods require access to the structure. They also require a significant amount of equipment and expertise to perform inspection. The inspections are typically based on a schedule rather than based on the condition of the structure. Furthermore, the cost associated with these traditional non-destructive techniques can be rather prohibitive. Therefore, there is a need to develop a cost-effective, in-service, diagnostic system for monitoring structural integrity in composite structures. Structural health monitoring techniques based on dynamic response is being used for several years. Changes in lower natural frequencies and mode shapes with their special derivatives or stiffness/ exibility calculation from the measured displacement mode shapes are the most common parameters used in identification of damage. But the sensitivity of these parameters for incipient damage is not satisfactory. On the other hand, for in service structural health monitoring, direct use of structural response histories are more suitable. However, they are very few works reported in the literature on these aspects, especially for composite structures, where higher order modes are the ones that get normally excited due to the presence of flaws. Due to the absence of suitable direct procedure, damage identification from response histories needs inverse mapping; like artificial neural network. But, the main diffculty in such mapping using whole response histories is its high dimensionality. Different general purpose dimension reduction procedures; like principle component analysis or indepen- dent component analysis are available in the literature. As these dimensionally reduced spaces may loose the output uniqueness, which is an essential requirement for neural network mapping, suitable algorithms for extraction of damage signature from these re- sponse histories are not available. Alternatively, fusion of trained networks for different partitioning of the damage space or different number of dimension reduction technique, can overcome this issue efficiently. In addition, coordination of different networks trained with different partitioning for training and testing samples, training algorithms, initial conditions, learning and momentum rates, architectures and sequence of training etc., are some of the factors that improves the mapping efficiency of the networks. The applications of smart materials have drawn much attention in aerospace, civil, mechanical and even bioengineering. The emerging field of smart composite structures offers the promise of truly integrated health and usage monitoring, where a structure can sense and adapt to their environment, loading conditions and operational requirements, and materials can self-repair when damaged. The concept of structural health monitoring using smart materials relies on a network of sensors and actuators integrated with the structure. This area shows great promise as it will be possible to monitor the structural condition of a structure, throughout its service lifetime. Integrating intelligence into the structures using such networks is an interesting field of research in recent years. Some materials that are being used for this purpose include piezoelectric, magnetostrictive and fiber-optic sensors. Structural health monitoring using, piezoelectric or fiber-optic sensors are available in the literature. However, very few works have been reported in the literature on the use of magnetostrictive materials, especially for composite structures. Non contact sensing and actuation with high coupling factor, along with other prop- erties such as large bandwidth and less voltage requirement, make magnetostrictive materials increasingly popular as potential candidates for sensors and actuators in structural health monitoring. Constitutive relationships of magnetostrictive material are represented through two equations, one for actuation and other for sensing, both of which are coupled through magneto-mechanical coefficient. In existing finite element formulation, both the equations are decoupled assuming magnetic field as proportional to the applied current. This assumption neglects the stiffness contribution coming from the coupling between mechanical and magnetic domains, which can cause the response to deviate from the time response. In addition, due to different fabrication and curing difficulties, the actual properties of this material such as magneto-mechanical coupling coefficient or elastic modulus, may differ from results measured at laboratory conditions. Hence, identification of the material properties of these embedded sensor and actuator are essential at their in-situ condition. Although, finite element method still remains most versatile, accurate and generally applicable technique for numerical analysis, the method is computationally expensive for wave propagation analysis of large structures. This is because for accurate prediction, the finite element size should be of the order of the wavelength, which is very small due to high frequency loading. Even in health monitoring studies, when the flaw sizes are very small (of the order of few hundred microns), only higher order modes will get affected. This essentially leads to wave propagation problem. The requirement of cost-effective computation of wave propagation brings us to the necessity of spectral finite element method, which is suitable for the study of wave propagation problems. By virtue of its domain transfer formulation, it bypasses the large system size of finite element method. Further, inverse problem such as force identification problem can be performed most conveniently and efficiently, compared to any other existing methods. In addition, spectral element approach helps us to perform force identification directly from the response histories measured in the sensor. The spectral finite element is used widely for both elementary and higher order one or two dimensional waveguides. Higher order waveguides, normally gives a behavior, where a damping mode (evanescent) will start propagating beyond a certain frequency called the cut-off frequency. Hence, when the loading frequencies are much beyond their corresponding cut-off frequencies, higher order mo des start propagating along the structure and should be considered in the analysis of wave propagations. Based on these considerations, three main goals are identified to be pursued in this thesis. The first is to develop the constitutive relationship for magnetostrictive sensor and actuator suitable for structural analysis. The second is the development of different numerical tools for the modelling the damages. The third is the application of these developed elements towards solving inverse problems such as, material property identification, impact force identification, detection and identification of delamination in composite structure. The thesis consists of four parts spread over six chapters. In the first part, linear, nonlinear, coupled and uncoupled constitutive relationships of magnetostrictive materials are studied and the elastic modulus and magnetostrictive constant are evaluated from the experimental results reported in the literature. In uncoupled model, magnetic field for actuator is considered as coil constant times coil current. The coupled model is studied without assuming any explicit direct relationship with magnetic field. In linear coupled model, the elastic modulus, the permeability and magnetostrictive coupling are assumed as constant. In nonlinear-coupled model, the nonlinearity is decoupled and solved separately for the magnetic domain and mechanical domain using two nonlinear curves,’ namely the stress vs. strain curve and magnetic flux density vs. magnetic field curve. This is done by two different methods. In the first, the magnetic flux density is computed iteratively, while in the second, artificial neural network is used, where a trained network gives the necessary strain and magnetic flux density for a given magnetic field and stress level. In the second part, different finite element formulations for composite structures with embedded magnetostrictive patches, which can act both as sensors and actuators, is studied. Both mechanical and magnetic degrees of freedoms are considered in the formulation. One, two and three-dimensional finite element formulations for both coupled and uncoupled analysis is developed. These developed elements are then used to identify the errors in the overall response of the structure due to uncoupled assumption of the magnetostrictive patches and shown that this error is comparable with the sensitivity of the response due to different damage scenarios. These studies clearly bring out the requirement of coupled analysis for structural health monitoring when magnetostrictive sensor and actuator are used. For the specific cases of beam elements, super convergent finite element formulation for composite beam with embedded magnetostrictive patches is introduced for their specific advantages in having superior convergence and in addition, these elements are free from shear locking. A refined 2 -node beam element is derived based on classical and first order shear deformation theory for axial-flexural-shear coupled deformation in asymmetrically stacked laminated composite beams with <b>magnetostrictive</b> patches. The <b>element</b> has an exact shape function matrix, which is derived by exactly solving the static part of the governing equations of motion, where a general ply stacking is considered. This makes the element super convergent for static analysis. The formulated consistent mass matrix, however, is approximate. Since the stiffness is exactly represented, the formulated element predicts natural frequency to greater level of accuracy with smaller discretization compared to other conventional finite elements. Finally, these elements are used for material property identification in conjunction with artificial neural network. In the third part, frequency domain analysis is performed using spectrally formulated beam elements. The formulated elements consider deformation due to both shear and lateral contraction, and numerical experiments are performed to highlight the higher order effects, especially at high frequencies. Spectral element is developed for modelling wave propagation in composite laminate in the presence of <b>magnetostrictive</b> patches. The <b>element,</b> by virtue of its frequency domain formulation, can analyze very large domain with nominal cost of computation and is suitable for studying wave propagation through composite materials. Further more, identification of impact force is performed form the magnetostrictive sensor response histories using these spectral elements. In the last part, different numerical examples for structural health monitoring are directed towards studying the responses due to the presence of the delamination in the structure; and the identification of the delamination from these responses using artificial neural network. Neural network is applied to get structural damage status from the finite element response using its mapping feature, which requires output uniqueness. To overcome the loss of output uniqueness due to the dimension reduction, damage space is divided into different overlapped zones and then different networks are trained for these zones. Committee machine is used to co ordinate among these networks. Next, a five-stage hierarchy of networks is used to consider partitioning of damage space, where different dimension reduction algorithms and different partitioning between training and testing samples are used for better mapping fro the identification procedure. The results of delamination detection for composite laminate show that the method developed in this thesis can be applied to structural damage detection and health monitoring for various industrial structures. This thesis collectively addresses all aspects pertaining to the solution of inverse problem and specially the health monitoring of composite structures using magnetostric tive sensor and actuator. In addition, the thesis discusses the necessity of higher order theory in the high frequency analysis of wavw propagation. The thesis ends with brief summary of the tasks accomplished, significant contribution made to the literature and the future applications where the proposed methods addressed in this thesis can be applied...|$|R
