50|$|Although {{particles}} and TOC are usually measured using on-line methods, {{there is significant}} value in complimentary or alternative off-line lab analysis. The value of the lab analysis has two aspects: cost and speciation. Smaller UPW facilities that cannot afford to purchase on-line instrumentation often choose off-line testing. TOC {{can be measured in}} the grab sample at a concentration as low as 5 ppb, using the same technique employed for the on-line analysis (see on-line <b>method</b> <b>description).</b> This detection level covers the majority of needs of less critical electronic and all pharmaceutical applications. When speciation of the organics is required for troubleshooting or design purposes, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) provides an effective analysis. This method allows for identification of biopolymers, humics, low molecular weight acids and neutrals, and more, while characterizing nearly 100% of the organic composition in UPW with sub-ppb level of TOC.|$|E
