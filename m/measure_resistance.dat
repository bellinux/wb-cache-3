25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low {{input offset voltage}} and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously <b>measure</b> <b>resistance</b> and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|A {{more precise}} way to <b>measure</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is to place}} an object within an artificial, uniform stream of air where the {{velocity}} is known. The first person to experiment in this fashion was Francis Herbert Wenham, who in doing so constructed the first wind tunnel in 1871. Wenham was {{also a member of}} the first professional organization dedicated to aeronautics, the Royal Aeronautical Society of the United Kingdom. Objects placed in wind tunnel models are almost always smaller than in practice, so a method was needed to relate small scale models to their real-life counterparts. This was achieved with the invention of the dimensionless Reynolds number by Osborne Reynolds. Reynolds also experimented with laminar to turbulent flow transition in 1883.|$|E

50|$|An {{instrument}} for <b>measuring</b> <b>resistance</b> is called an ohmmeter.

25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to <b>measure</b> <b>resistance</b> or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E
2500|$|To <b>measure</b> <b>resistance,</b> {{switches}} {{arrange for}} a small battery within the instrument to pass a current through the device under test and the meter coil. Since the current available depends {{on the state of}} charge of the battery which changes over time, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohms scale to zero it. In the usual circuits found in analog multimeters, the meter deflection is inversely proportional to the resistance, so full-scale will be 0ohms, and higher resistance will correspond to smaller deflections. [...] The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mercury probe}} applies mercury {{contacts}} of well-defined areas to a flat sample.
