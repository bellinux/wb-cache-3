Designed by project lead Clive Gratton, the demo was created solely in order to determine whether it was possible for a console to handle hundreds of independently acting characters on-screen at once. The demo, which took six months to code, consisted of three-hundred Roman soldiers running over a hill with a castle in the background and the player character {{in the middle of the}} group. The demo ran at 60fps and had a draw distance of 750 meters, which was <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> Gratton had anticipated.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the FCC continues to be influenced by the corporate media lobby. The strong, direct relationships that have developed over the years between regulators and corporate media lobbyists, is essential to greater influence. It goes <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the idea that the lobby has simply been around for a while. Members of the FCC have traditionally had strong connections to industry. As the job of an FCC commissioner or staffer is often highly technical, and specific knowledge of the dynamics of the telecommunications and media industries must be known, commissioners are often plucked out of high-paying jobs in the industry. History has shown, {{due to the fact that}} FCC Commissioners are appointed only to five-year terms, that there is a revolving door between the Commission and industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known predecessor to {{the bass}} drum was the Turkish davul, a cylindrical drum that featured two thin heads. The heads were stretched over hoops and then {{attached to a}} narrow shell. To play this instrument, a person would strike {{the right side of}} the davul with a large wooden stick, while the left side would be struck a rod. When struck, the davul produced a sound <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> that of the other drums in existence. Because of this unique tone, davuls were used extensively in war and combat, where a deep and percussive sound was needed to ensure that the forces were marching in proper step with one another. The military bands of the Ottoman Janissaries in the 18th century were one of the first groups to utilize davuls in their music; Ottoman marching songs often had a heavy emphasis on percussion, and their military bands were primarily made up of davul, cymbal and kettle drum players.|$|E
25|$|Igor Aizenberg {{and colleagues}} {{introduced}} it to Artificial Neural Networks in 2000. The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965. These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes {{the learning of}} a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.|$|E

25|$|The Corinthian Order {{does not}} have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew {{directly}} out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals. The capital was very <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped like a large krater, a bell-shaped mixing bowl, and being ornamented with a double row of acanthus leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting {{the corners of the}} abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to Vitruvius, the capital was invented by a bronze founder, Callimachus of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it. The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.|$|E
500|$|The {{islands that}} {{surrounded}} the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, semi-arid, and sub-tropical with a long dry season and little rain. The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions {{is said to be}} Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico, although it is <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the Solnhofen lagoons. The flora of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low (...) shrubs. Contrary to reconstructions of Archaeopteryx climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree pollen also is absent.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from magazines and websites. Critics praised multiple {{aspects of the}} game, particularly its graphics, sound and value. Joe Fielder of GameSpot felt that Perfect Dark is [...] "unparalleled" [...] as a console first-person shooter, while Nintendo Power said that the game [...] is [...] "more compelling than most action movies and <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> any video game of its type." [...] Martin Kitts, writing for N64 Magazine, described it as [...] "dauntingly huge", stating that it [...] "takes everything that made its predecessor such an enduring favourite and does it bigger, better and more often." [...] Chi Kong Lui of GameCritics criticised the weak characters and unoriginal storyline, but nevertheless judged the [...] "extraordinary amount [...] of high-quality multiplayer modes and features", meant that [...] "the game is still a blast".|$|E
500|$|However, many reviewers {{felt that}} the album was {{not up to the}} {{standards}} of the Foo Fighters' previous work. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that although One by One was well-produced and played, it was too polished to [...] "hit at a gut-level" [...] and that the songs were [...] "not as immediate or memorable" [...] as the band's earlier compositions. Writing for PopMatters, Margaret Schwartz considered the album [...] "ultimately unsatisfying" [...] despite its quality writing and production, particularly for not drifting much from the band's typical style. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club described One by One as [...] "mostly middling, sticking to slick, pounding, functional rock that doesn't dig <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the usual spleen-venting and loud-quiet brooding-to-bluster formula". BBC's Nick Reynolds found the record inconsistent, praising the first four tracks but saying the following songs did not maintain the same quality, and concluding that although One By One is a good record, it may frustrate a listener. Eric Carr of Pitchfork was very critical of the album, saying it was overproduced and the songs are [...] "weightless, antiseptic cuts" [...] with [...] "skillful composition" [...] but [...] "lacking strength and character".|$|E
500|$|The episode first {{aired in}} the United States on September 8, 1998. Since then, it has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Andrew Wood of The Plain Dealer had mixed feelings for the episode, stating the episode {{did a good job}} of setting up the world of Pokémon, and that it was faithful to the game. However, Wood thought it was [...] "apparent" [...] in this episode that without a traveling partner, [...] "Ash just isn't all that interesting". Andrew Tei of Mania.com said that [...] "one great thing about listening to early dubs is how the voice actors haven't completely gotten into their roles yet. Ash's and James' voices are <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> where they end up at." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone believed the best moment of the episode to be the Pokémon battle on television at the beginning, stating that [...] "the Pokémon battle side-to-side in black and white. Their movements are slow and appear to be turn-based. It emulates the game perfectly, then quickly transforms into a more realistic, full-color battle. Few game-based anime series incorporate the game elements so well." [...] X-Entertainment considered the best part of the episode to be the moment when Ash spots the mysterious Ho-Oh, a Pokémon whose data was not included in the Pokédex at the time.|$|E

500|$|Messenger {{points out}} that Rommel had many reasons to be {{grateful}} to Hitler, including his interference to arrange for him to receive command of an armoured division, his elevation {{to the status of}} a national hero, and continued interest and support from the dictator. Remy states that the attachment to Hitler went <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> any gratefulness could explain, and that Hitler had become Rommel's source of motivation. Some, like Randall Hansen, highlight the similarities in background and personality that facilitated the rapport between the two, while others, like Richard Overy, state that Rommel's main appeal to Hitler was that he was everything Hitler was not, while the political scientist Roland Detsch, in a review of Maurice Remy's book, comments that despite Remy's efforts, the strange relationship remains hard to understand. Wolfram Pyta remarks that Hitler did not compete with Rommel for the war leader image because the two complemented each other perfectly. They were similar {{in the sense that they}} were the only ones with a cultural presence and objects around whom German society's grand narrative was being built, thus Rommel was the only German general who would have been capable of challenging Hitler's rule, had he ever crossed the Rubicon from his [...] "apolitical-to-the-core" [...] military world and developed a serious, critical view of Hitler's political dealings. However, Rommel himself had fallen for Hitler's charisma almost until the end.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Murphy {{achieved}} mainstream success when he {{was cast}} in the leading role in Danny Boyle's horror film [...] 28 Days Later. He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim who is [...] "perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world" [...] after waking from a coma in a London hospital, 28 days later. Casting director of the film Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy [...] for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs. [...] Stevens stated {{that it was only}} after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude {{at the beginning of the}} film. She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a [...] "dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film".

2500|$|Net {{photosynthesis}} in {{the water}} column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. [...] Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean's surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer). [...] The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. [...] The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the photic zone. [...] When it is <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur. [...] The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth. [...] As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth.|$|E
