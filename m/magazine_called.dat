5|$|One of {{the first}} {{challenges}} to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> ONE. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages, {{on the grounds that}} the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.|$|E

These were both edited by Jim Hendryx Jr. They were numbered vol. 45, no. 1 and 2, continuing the volume numbering of Thrilling Wonder. Both were selections from past issues of Thrilling Wonder; the second one convinced Ned Pines, the publisher who had bought Wonder Stories from Gernsback in 1936 and who still owned {{the rights to the}} stories, to start a reprint <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories in 1964; a companion, Treasury of Great Western Stories, was added the next year.|$|E
5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> The NY Hits Magazine.

His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry.

5|$|Expected by {{his family}} {{to work as a}} stockbroker, Kertész pursued {{photography}} independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.|$|E

5|$|Manual was {{initially}} a three-year school with some general academic classes and {{an emphasis on}} mechanical and industrial training. Although graduates recall the school being viewed as blue-collar and academically inferior to Male High School in its early days, numerous early graduates {{went on to become}} medical doctors, and students published a literary <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> The Crimson from 1899 to 1955. In order to accommodate newly added French and Latin classes, Manual was expanded to a four-year school in 1901. In 1911, Manual became the first school in Kentucky to serve lunches to students.|$|E
5|$|The game grossed US$200 {{million on}} its launch day, setting {{a new record}} for the franchise. Reach sold well in most territories, moving {{more than three million}} units its first month in North America. Critical {{reception}} was positive; reviewers from publications such as GamePro, IGN, and Official Xbox <b>Magazine</b> <b>called</b> it the best Halo title yet. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and sound, but the plot and characters were less positively received. Reach was Bungie's final Halo game; subsequent games have been overseen by Microsoft subsidiary 343 Industries.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much {{attention}} at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; the upright cabinets were common, while the cocktail models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E

5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge <b>magazine</b> <b>called</b> the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E
