40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at SverigeGrepen AB. SverigeGrepen {{is a company}} that hasone product on the market; a <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> that is designed to be used for mucking inshavings or peat. The aim of this thesis was to develop a new <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> that isadapted to be used in straw. The development started with a pilot study where experience of mucking wascollected to be able to understand what and why certain characteristics are importantfor the function and use of the <b>manure</b> <b>fork.</b> A basic concept was developed where the main function was fulfilled, which meantthat a separation between dung and straw could be performed in a way that wasbeneficial for the user. The work resulted in four concepts of how a <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> could be used in the strawthat can be designed and constructed. The conclusion that the work gave was that allconcepts met the main requirements required by a <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> to use in straw. However, concept four provides a good visual impression, while its benefits areassumed to be important qualities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will {{describe}} the redesign of the <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> SverigeGrepen. The product {{is available for}} purchase in Scandinavia and {{and parts of the}} rest of Europe. The product is available in stores but the companys goal is to start distribute it over the internet. A problem today with a purchase over the internet is that the costumer has to pay a high shipping-fee due to the products unique form. The long handle contributes to the high shipping-fee which makes it hard to attract costumers to purchase the product online. Deficiencies have been found at the manure forks basket and needs to be examined. These problems need to be checked out so that SverigeGrepen can become an even more compatitive product. To obtain a solid theoretical ground a literature was made about the concerned subjects. The project proceeded with the gathering of information about the product, by communications with the contact at the company and usage of the <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> in itÂ´s real enviroment to locate complications with the design. Some temporary souloutions have been tested but would in the long run be in need of new souloutions. Based on similar products and the existing soloutions some new consepts were introduced. The best concepts were mdeled in CAD and modified by some input from the company and a plastic worker. Images of the CAD model and a real life-size prototype printed in a 3 D-printer were used as support during the discussions. The outcome of the project is that design documents of an easy to use souloution to assemble/dissmantle the manure forks shafthalves whitch minimizes the packaging volume and thereby reduces the shipping costs, were made. Designpropositions were produced to eliminate deficiencies located at parts of the basket {{in the beginning of the}} project...|$|E
40|$|Horizon oil spill, representatives {{traveled}} to the gulf coast to observe and assess workers involved in beach cleaning operations, to identify potential hazards and to provide guidance for protecting response workers. One beach cleaning operation involved the use of lightweight, battery-powered, motorized vibrating <b>manure</b> <b>forks</b> to remove tar balls and patties from beach sand. To investigate the vibration exposures associated with these operations, we performed a laboratory study on the vibrations produced by the forks operated during simulated beach cleaning. The objectives {{of this study were}} to characterize the vibrations {{associated with the use of}} vibrating <b>manure</b> <b>forks</b> and to estimate vibration exposure time limits based on the recommendations of ANSI S 2. 70 - 2006. 2.

40|$|Most work in horse stables is {{performed}} manually {{in much the}} same way as a century ago, with old-fashioned tools and equipment. It is one of the least mechanised sectors dealing with large animals, which often involves work in awkward postures and lifts of heavy loads. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the ergonomic risks in the human-horse work environment. This thesis seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the human-horse work environment, work tasks, workload and frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms and to identify potential risk factors for the development of musculoskeletal symptoms. Self-reporting methods (questionnaires, rating scales), observation methods (OWAS, REBA), descriptive task analysis (HTA, HA, GTS) and biomechanical analysis (JACK) were used to collect and analyse data. Riding instructors surveyed in the questionnaire study reported high levels of perceived musculoskeletal symptoms in at least one of nine anatomical areas during the past year and the past week. The most frequently reported problem areas were the shoulders, the lower back and the neck. Mucking out stables was considered to be the task involving the heaviest work. OWAS analysis showed that three work tasks contained a high proportion of unacceptably awkward work postures, namely mucking out, preparing bedding and sweeping. During mucking out and sweeping, the back was bent and twisted for most of the time. There were many high-risk operations involved in mucking out boxes and disposing of bedding material. Emptying a wheel barrow on the muck heap included high-risk operations with awkward postures such as twisted, bent back arms over shoulder level and handling high loads. The analytical methods used clearly revealed where in the work tasks the ergonomic problems occurred. In almost all operations with a high risk level, a shafted tool or wheelbarrow was used. Analysis of the shaft length of two hand-held tools used for mucking out (<b>manure</b> <b>fork,</b> shavings fork) showed that the <b>manure</b> <b>fork</b> should have a longer shaft to reduce loading on the back. The results for the shavings fork were inconclusive, but indicated the importance of changes in work technique. More in-depth knowledge of the musculoskeletal symptoms and work tasks performed in the human-horse work environment makes it easier to plan and implement measures to prevent musculoskeletal symptoms in this particular group of workers. ...|$|E
50|$|A {{pitchfork}} is {{an agricultural}} tool {{with a long}} handle and long, thick, widely separated pointed tynes used to lift and pitch or throw loose material, such as hay, straw or leaves. True pitchforks typically have {{only two or three}} tynes, while <b>manure</b> <b>forks</b> have four or more. However, some forks with more than three tynes are also used for handling loose material such as hay or silage. Other forks have up to ten tynes with different lengths and spacing depending on purpose. They are usually made of steel with a long wooden handle, but may also be made from wood, wrought iron, bamboo, or alloy. In some parts of England a pitchfork is known as a prong and, in parts of Ireland, a sprong refers to a four-pronged pitchfork. The pitchfork is similar to the shorter and sturdier garden fork.|$|R
40|$|Motorized {{vibrating}} <b>manure</b> <b>forks</b> {{were used}} in beach-cleaning operations following the mas-sive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the vibration emissions of these motorized forks and to provide a first approximation of hand-transmitted vibration exposures to workers using these forks for beach cleaning. Methods: Eight operators were recruited to operate the motorized forks during this laboratory study. Four fork configurations {{were used in}} the study; two motor speeds and two fork basket options were evaluated. Accelerations were measured near each hand as the operators completed the simulated beach-cleaning task. Results: The dominant vibration frequency for these tools was identified to be around 20 Hz. Because acceleration was found to increase with motor speed, workers should consider operating these tools with just enough speed to get the job done. These forks exhibited considerable acceleration magnitudes when unloaded. Conclusions: The study results suggest that the motor should not be operated with the fork in the unloaded state. Anti-vibration gloves are not effective at attenuating the vibration frequencies produced by these forks, and they may even amplify the transmitted vibration and increase hand/arm fatigue. While regular work gloves are suitable, vibration-reducing gloves may not be appropriate for use with these tools. These considerations may also be generally applicable for the use of motorized forks in other workplace environments...|$|R
