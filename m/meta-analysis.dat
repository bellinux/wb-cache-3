5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that circumcision is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer. A 2015 <b>meta-analysis</b> found a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with circumcision in black men. A 2016 <b>meta-analysis</b> found that men with prostate cancer {{were less likely to be}} circumcised.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and <b>meta-analysis</b> of prospective studies found insufficient {{evidence to support}} an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|A <b>meta-analysis</b> {{concluded}} that a 1640mg increase in the daily intake of potassium {{was associated with a}} 21% lower risk of stroke. Potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate may be useful to control mild hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Aging (C.elegans and crickets). A 2017 {{review and}} <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found that people}} with {{diabetes}} who were taking metformin had significantly lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease than those on other therapies.|$|E
5|$|Some older {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a subsequent <b>meta-analysis</b> including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity may help prevent vasospasm their use does not appear to change outcomes.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>meta-analysis</b> of {{randomized}} controlled trials found linezolid {{to be more}} effective than glycopeptide antibiotics (such as vancomycin and teicoplanin) and beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and smaller studies appear to confirm its superiority over teicoplanin in the treatment of all serious Gram-positive infections.|$|E
5|$|A <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found that}} {{psychological}} therapy {{is effective in}} reducing self-harm. The proportion of the adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%). Psychological therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and mentalization-based therapy (MBT).|$|E
5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a <b>meta-analysis</b> that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human menstrual cycle {{is similar to that of}} the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A <b>meta-analysis</b> of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a <b>meta-analysis</b> of 25 {{independent}} studies assessing {{effects of}} Bt Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact {{the survival of}} honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, {{and there is also}} a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 <b>meta-analysis</b> of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as <b>meta-analysis.</b> One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded that half the patients achieved a 50% reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90% reduction.|$|E
5|$|One {{study of}} 118 exocrine {{pancreatic}} cancer (EPC) patients and 399 hospital controls in eastern Spain found high selenium concentrations to be inversely {{associated with the}} risk of EPC. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has a <b>meta-analysis</b> of such selenium supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{examining}} the health impact of sugars are inconclusive. The United Nations <b>meta-analysis</b> and WHO studies showed contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Other studies indicated variable results between health effects, particularly on obesity, {{and whether the}} research {{was funded by the}} sugar industry or those by independent sponsors. The 'empty calories' argument is that a diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, {{although there is a}} generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and <b>meta-analysis</b> found no evidence that yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent <b>meta-analysis</b> {{including}} data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This <b>meta-analysis</b> was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of <b>meta-analysis,</b> statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found no}} effect of garlic on {{colorectal}} cancer. A 2014 <b>meta-analysis</b> found garlic supplements or allium vegetables {{to have no}} effect on colorectal cancers.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, various actions can be taken if the patient has predisposing conditions. These have been reviewed in a <b>meta-analysis.</b> A separate <b>meta-analysis</b> addresses interventions for emergency patients with baseline insufficient kidney function.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in preventing the incidence of PHN found in the one RCT included in the <b>meta-analysis</b> that compared placebo to PO famciclovir treatment within 72 hours of HZ rash onset. Studies using valaciclovir treatment were not included in the <b>meta-analysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2003, The UK ECT Review group {{published}} a systematic review and <b>meta-analysis</b> comparing ECT to placebo and antidepressant drugs. This <b>meta-analysis</b> demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy {{relative to the}} {{mean in terms of}} the standard deviation) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 <b>meta-analysis</b> {{of case-control}} and cohort studies found limited {{evidence}} for {{an association between}} higher garlic consumption and reduced risk of prostate cancer, but the studies were suspected as having publication bias. A 2013 <b>meta-analysis</b> of epidemiological studies found garlic intake {{to be associated with}} decreased risk of prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{found no}} {{evidence}} that vitamin C supplementation reduces the risk of lung cancer in healthy or high risk (smokers and asbestos-exposed) people. A 2014 <b>meta-analysis</b> found that vitamin C intake might protect against lung cancer risk. A second <b>meta-analysis</b> found no effect on the risk of prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|A <b>meta-analysis</b> {{confirmed}} that ACE inhibitors are effective {{and certainly the}} first-line choice in hypertension treatment. This <b>meta-analysis</b> was based on 20 trials and a cohort of 158,998 patients, of whom 91% were hypertensive. ACE inhibitors were used as the active treatment in seven trials (n=76,615) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 13 trials (n=82,383).|$|E
25|$|A <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found that}} playing music {{improves}} patient tolerability of the procedure.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fluoxetine and other antidepressants {{in the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate depression is controversial. A <b>meta-analysis</b> published by Kirsch in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant. A 2009 <b>meta-analysis</b> by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI paroxetine and the non-SSRI antidepressant imipramine has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression. A 2012 <b>meta-analysis</b> using individual patient level-data of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression concluded statistically and clinically significant benefit was seen irrespective of baseline depression severity, and no significant effect was found on baseline severity on observed efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is {{no longer}} {{thought to be a}} risk factor for {{coronary}} heart disease. A 2012 <b>meta-analysis</b> concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day. Moreover, in one preliminary study, habitual coffee consumption was associated with improved vascular function. A 2014 <b>meta-analysis</b> concluded that cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and stroke is less likely with 3–5 cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day but more likely with over 5 cups per day. A 2016 <b>meta-analysis</b> showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found that}} acute {{cannabis}} use increased {{the risk of}} an automobile crash.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression: a <b>meta-analysis</b> of 48 studies showed an overall effect size of 1.03, which is clinically highly significant. Similarly, a <b>meta-analysis</b> of five studies of group psychotherapy for adult sexual abuse survivors showed moderate to strong effect sizes, {{and there is also}} good evidence for effectiveness with chronic traumatic stress in war veterans.|$|E
25|$|One <b>meta-analysis</b> found a {{decrease}} in mortality in elderly people. Another <b>meta-analysis</b> covering over 350,000 people concluded that vitamin D supplementation in unselected community-dwelling individuals does not reduce skeletal (total fracture) or non-skeletal outcomes (myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cancer) by more than 15%, and that further research trials with similar design are unlikely to change these conclusions.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 <b>meta-analysis</b> of 380 {{studies found}} a small {{positive}} effect that {{can be explained by}} publication bias.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 <b>meta-analysis</b> {{concluded}} that adenovirus 36 (Ad36) infection {{is associated with}} an increased risk of obesity development.|$|E
