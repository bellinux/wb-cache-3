500|$|Despite his {{scholarly}} {{achievements and}} the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: [...] "My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians <b>may</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> know, this man has been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> play a scale perfectly but try it with a metronome and you will find out that you don't. I thought I did until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Passively, not actively,' said Elizabeth; 'but {{it is not}} {{to please}} others, it is only that they <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> well bred, or rather that they may not think about you at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{removed the}} picture and placed it, by his directions, on a chair that stood midway between us. To my {{surprise}} his tones faltered; I saw tears rising in his eyes. [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> see a picture there," [...] he said. [...] "You are wrong. You see my wife herself. Stand here, and look at my wife with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{sacrifice}} a {{very large}} sum of money. His father cannot pay it without his consent. The father may die any day, and then the money will belong altogether to the son. You have, none of you, any claim upon him. It is likely he <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will have a claim on the estate, not trusting his own father." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> what <b>you</b> choose. I {{have never}} implied {{to you by}} word or deed that I have grown to think {{otherwise}} of him, and I never will. And I shall marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you wouldn't {{have married}} me then, Nancy, if I'd told you," [...] said Godfrey, urged, in the {{bitterness}} of his self-reproach, to prove to himself that his conduct had not been utter folly. [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would now, but you wouldn't then. With your pride and your father's, you'd have hated having {{anything to do with}} me after the talk there'd have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|At which Chitterlow {{seemed to}} bestir himself. [...] "Ra-ther," [...] he said. [...] "And {{sometimes}} it's his own fault {{and sometimes it}} isn't. Usually it is. If it isn't one thing it's another. If it isn't the manager's wife it's bar-bragging. I tell you things happen at times. I'm a fatalist. The fact is Character has you. You can't get away from it. You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> do, but you don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can only}} guess. Perhaps he feels {{you have a}} claim and he has {{neglected}} you. Then he <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will do him credit and realize the ambitions he's getting too old to carry out. He has noted that you have inherited your father's character, and I've heard him remark that while Tom Thirlwell had extravagant notions, he certainly had brains. However, {{we were talking about}} Evelyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] Lord Arranmore answered, [...] "when you are {{a little}} older you will know that to take life seriously is a sheer impossibility. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> are doing it, but you are not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} to say, Ziska? Whatever you say, do not abuse him. It is my affair, not yours. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> what <b>you</b> like of me for taking such a husband, but {{remember}} that he is to be my husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You are {{stifling}} it. I {{say again}} that I'm not blaming you, Hugh. You are made differently from me. All you care for, really, is your career. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> care, at times, for--other things, but it isn't so." ...|$|R
6000|$|Motioning to Gervaise {{to follow}} him, the Arab stepped into his boat. Gervaise {{turned to the}} men, and said in Italian, [...] "Thanks, my friends, you have well {{discharged}} any debt that you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> owe me. Will you tell that villain"--and {{he pointed to the}} captain threateningly--"I warn him that some day I will kill him like a dog!" [...] Then, turning, he stepped into the bow of the boat, and the two men who rowed it at once pushed off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Empty words," [...] she said, [...] "idle protestations, {{which are}} but used {{to hide the}} obduracy of your resentment. Would you have me believe you, then leave the hut this instant, and retire from a country which every hour renders more dangerous. Do this, and I <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have forgiven me; refuse it, and again I call on moon and stars, heaven and earth, to witness the unrelenting resentment with which you prosecute your mother for a fault, which, if it be one, arose out of love to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have managed}} that well," [...] he said, {{when they were}} alone, [...] "and I am heartily glad that you have succeeded. I made you out two hours ago. We will stop here another two or three minutes, so that the men <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are {{bargaining}} for a passage for the negro, and then the sooner he is on board and you are on your way back the better, for the wind is rising, and I fancy {{it is going to}} blow a good deal harder before night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall give me {{one thing}} though, if you will, sweet lady, that I <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> often, and have {{something}} {{to remind me of}} you; nay, you shall give me two things--one is a lock of your soft brown hair, the other is a kiss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then so be it," [...] Sir William said. [...] "Now, Sir Archie, do you fix a {{place for}} their encampment, and make such other {{arrangements}} as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> fit. <b>You</b> will, of course, draw rations and other necessaries for them as regular members of the band." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must keep}} all your {{favorable}} opinions for the Delaware girls, Deerslayer, if <b>you</b> seriously <b>think</b> thus {{of those of}} your own colour," [...] she said, affecting to laugh.

6000|$|... "No, but I {{suppose it}} made them willing {{to see it in}} the pleasantest light. Mrs. March--that was their name--wouldn't allow me to say that I enjoyed Quebec, because if I hadn't seen Europe, I couldn't {{properly}} enjoy it. 'You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> enjoy it,' she was always saying, 'but that's merely fancy.' Still I cling to my delusion. But I don't know whether I cared more for Quebec, or the beautiful little villages in the country all about it. The whole landscape looks just like a dream of 'Evangeline.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The widow put one arm (the {{other was}} not at liberty) round her daughter's waist. [...] "You foolish child," [...] she said, [...] "will you never {{understand}} that your poor mother is getting old and irritable? I <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have made a great mistake, in sacrificing yourself to the infirmities of an asthmatic stranger at Munich; but as to being ever really angry with you----! Kiss me, my love; I never was fonder of you than I am now. Lift my veil. Oh, my darling, I don't like giving you to anybody, even to Fritz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want {{somebody}} {{to take care}} of you and look after you. I'm the man. You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can fool me; but I can tell. You're weakening on this Freddie proposition. You're beginning to see that it won't do. One of these days you're going to come to me and say: 'George, you were right. I take the count. Me for the quiet sneak to the station, without anybody knowing, and the break for London, and the wedding at the registrar's.' Oh, I know! I couldn't have loved you all this time and not know. You're weakening." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am glad a task {{to me is}} given, [...] To labor at day by day, [...] For {{it brings}} me health and {{strength}} and hope, [...] And I cheerfully learn to say, [...] "Head, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think,</b> Heart, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> feel, [...] But, Hand, you shall work alway!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Macumazahn," [...] {{he said in}} {{a hollow}} voice, [...] "I will follow your head, and not my own heart. Yet you sow a strange seed, Macumazahn, or so <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>think</b> when <b>you</b> see its fruit." [...] And he gave me a wild look--a look that frightened me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> as <b>you</b> please, Doctor Clay," [...] said he to {{the master}} of the Hall. [...] "I feel sure in my mind that Lawrence and those other boys are guilty. I do not think Mr. Sparr would accuse them if he was not pretty sure of his ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Any way," [...] she remarked, after {{a moment}} or two of consideration, [...] "this is better than malaria. If you get {{anything}} of that kind into your system, it is probable that you will never get it out, and it is at any time likely to affect your health, one way or another; but love affairs are different. They have a powerful influence upon a person, as I well know, but there is not about them that insidious poison, which, although you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have entirely expelled it from your system, is so likely to crop out again, especially in the spring and fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘No, no,’ said I; ‘you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{have made}} a choice, but it was blindfold, and you must make it over again. The Count’s service is a good one; what are you leaving it for? Are you not {{throwing}} away the substance for the shadow? No, do not answer me yet. You imagine that I am a prosperous nobleman, just declared my uncle’s heir, {{on the threshold of}} the best of good fortune, and, {{from the point of view}} of a judicious servant, a jewel of a master to serve and stick to? Well, my boy, I am nothing of the kind, nothing of the kind.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{withstand}} them if I {{thought they}} were wrong," [...] the boatman said sturdily, [...] "and if I were sure that your father would object to your going; {{but that is what}} I am not sure. He may think it the best thing for you to begin early under the protection of Master Francis, and again he <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> a great deal too young for such wild work. He has certainly always let you have pretty much your own way, and has allowed you to come and go as you like, but this is a different business altogether. I am sorely bested as to what I ought to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} that I forgot," [...] the latter said; [...] "here is a pass for you to leave the gates at once. You had better go out by the north, so that they <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> have ridden to Calais, and then take a wide detour and ride for Nantes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a {{thinking}} brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, {{if we could}} be shaken together.
