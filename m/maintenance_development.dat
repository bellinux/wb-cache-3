40|$|In recent decades, by {{introducing}} {{the concept of}} lean production within manufacturing companies the vulnerability to system disturbances has increased and so, the demand for dependable production equipment. The need for having high production equipment availability causes companies {{to have a more}} effective and efficient maintenance strategy in order to reach a competitive production system. Despite the increasing demand on reliable production equipment, few manufacturing companies work with strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development</b> and {{a large part of the}} manufacturing industry lack clear maintenance strategies. One reason for that may be that the existing methods and concepts for <b>maintenance</b> <b>development</b> are quite resource demanding. It is therefore difficult to develop the maintenance work in accordance with the strategic goals of the manufacturing companies. The main objective of this project is to define a process of formulating maintenance strategy as a tool for the maintenance managers in order to formulate and have further development of maintenance strategy in a strategic way. The problem has been solved by literature review and through case study at the manufacturing company to investigate the company’s view on strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development.</b> As a result, formulated maintenance strategy has been provided and presented...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{maintenance}} {{is a substantial}} financial post. The total value of maintenance budgets in Europe has been estimated to be approximately 1500 billion € per year. At the same time, {{there are indications that}} about a third of these costs are wasted due to poor planning, overtime costs, inferior use of preventive maintenance and so forth. However, the diversity between different types of industry is substantial. While the process industry, which is rather vulnerable to disturbances, has a tradition of viewing its maintenance as a strategic resource, the picture is quite different in discrete item manufacturing industry. Historically, manufacturing industry has had a surplus of finished goods and Work-In-Progress buffers between machinery. Therefore, the manufacturing industry has been able to fulfil its production demand despite unreliable production equipment. In the last few decades, the concept of lean production has started to spread within the manufacturing industry as a means to improve competitiveness. Manufacturing companies apply lean tools such as flow oriented production layout, Just-In-Time production and Demand-Flow-Technology. As a consequence, the vulnerability to system disturbances increases and hence, the demand for dependable production equipment increases. Despite this increasing demand on reliable production equipment, few manufacturing companies work with strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development.</b> One reason for this may be that the existing methods and concepts for <b>maintenance</b> <b>development</b> are quite resource demanding. The main objective with this research is to develop a simple and cost effective approach aimed to formulate, implement, and evaluate maintenance strategies for the manufacturing industry. In five case studies the following has been studied: (1) The industry’s view on strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development,</b> (2) Formulation of maintenance strategies, (3) Implementation of maintenance strategies, (4) Cost of Poor Maintenance, and (5) Results from strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development.</b> As a result from this research, a process for the formulation of maintenance strategies has been developed. Further, a number of driving forces and obstacles, that influence the implementation of maintenance strategies, have been identified. The concept of Cost of Poor Maintenance has been introduced as a means for evaluating the financial contribution of maintenance. Finally, three years of studies in three companies has shown substantial benefits from strategic <b>maintenance</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E

40|$|Manufacturers have {{in recent}} years {{become more and more}} aware of the {{benefits}} of offering more comprehensive value propositions. As the economic climate changes, more manufacturers are trying to capture value further downstream in the value chain by providing services. The field of performance management has been extensively adopted in production and the benefits of performance measurement have been widely praised both in literature and in business. The literature on performance management has also extended into service management and how to manage service performance. But how can performance measurement and performance measurement systems be implemented when the line between products and services becomes more and more unclear? Over a twenty week period, the researchers have studied, analyzed, and observed the procedures at Scania CV’s <b>maintenance</b> <b>development</b> and delivery organization. The study was conducted on Scania’s premises in Södertälje, Sweden. Scania’s Preventative <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Development</b> group develops and sets the requirements for the preventative maintenance programs Scania offers to its customers. The group had a desire to track and measure what effects changes made in the maintenance program have on the customer’s life cycle profit. At Scania’s Preventative <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Development</b> group, there is a developed performance measurement system, MPI-model, consisting of maintenance performance indicators (MPIs). The current MPI-model, however, lacks practical applicability. The master thesis has aimed at investigating how the MPI-model could be implemented in the preventative <b>maintenance</b> <b>development</b> by researching what criteria are set in literature for performance measures, how existing resources can be employed, and how performance measurement systems can be used. Apart from conducting a case study, in order to investigate how performance measurement systems could be implemented, an extensive literature review was also conducted to provide the necessary theoretical knowledge. The result of the study was a proposed three-step model that clarifies the requirements for the implementation of a performance measurement system...|$|E
