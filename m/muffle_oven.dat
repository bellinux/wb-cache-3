40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators are present in high concentrations. Therefore fly ash must {{be treated as a}} hazardous material. On the other hand, it may be a potential source of heavy metals. Zinc, lead, cadmium, and copper can be relatively easily removed during the thermal treatment of fly ash, e. g. in the form of chlorides. In return, wet extraction methods could provide promising results for these elements including chromium and nickel. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and compare thermal and hydrometallurgical treatment of {{municipal solid waste}} fly ash. Thermal treatment of fly ash was performed in a rotary reactor at temperatures between 950 and 1050 °C and in a <b>muffle</b> <b>oven</b> at temperatures from 500 to 1200 °C. The removal more than 90 % was reached by easy volatile heavy metals such as cadmium and lead and also by copper, however at higher temperature in the <b>muffle</b> <b>oven.</b> The alkaline (sodium hydroxide) and acid (sulphuric acid) leaching of the fly ash was carried out while the influence of temperature, time, concentration, and liquid/solid ratio were investigated. The combination of alkaline-acidic leaching enhanced the removal of, namely, zinc, chromium and nickel. Web of Science 33112327232...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Low {{crystalline}} PZT powder {{samples were}} successfully synthesized using polymeric precursor method and slow decomposition steps. The polymeric resin precursor was thermal {{treated in a}} <b>muffle</b> type <b>oven</b> varying the temperature from 250 °C to 700 °C and the time from 3 to 24 hours in order to investigate the order/disorder mechanism toward the amorphous powders. Powder samples with low crystalline phases were obtained at lower temperatures and long time of thermal treatment, demonstrating a kinetic dependence for organic removal and a thermodynamic barrier for crystallization processes. Through XRD and FTIR spectroscopy characterizations the long time thermal treated samples showed to be composed of the solid solution of metal oxides in absent of organic matter, originating broad XRD peaks profiles and no carbonaceous bands in FTIR spectra. A Photoluminescence characterization showed that the peak emission is higher for disordered and homogeneous phases, which only can be reached through the long time of thermal treatment...|$|R

40|$|Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{wood with}} {{dimensions}} (100 x 10 x 10 mm) was thermally treated at 275 degreesC in a <b>muffle</b> <b>oven</b> to impart resistance to microbial degradation. Low-temperature carbonised pine {{resulted in a}} visually homogeneously treated product with a substantial (about 70 % w/w) reduced non-cellulosic carbohydrates content, as compared with untreated pine. These components have been removed or have been partly converted into hydrophobic polymerisation products, which results in reduced water absorption in air of different relative humidity (RH) for carbonised pine. The flexural strength at high RH and after immersion in water of carbonised wood is comparable with untreated and creosote impregnated wood. However, at lower RH the carbonised wood is less strong. Only trace amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other phenolic compounds could be detected both in water leached from carbonised wood and untreated wood. Furans, mainly 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, have been demonstrated to leach in substantial amounts in the water from carbonised pine. An accelerated decay test in soil showed that low-temperature carbonisation of pine resulted in a product with considerably enhanced durability, as compared with untreated wood. Resistance of carbonised wood against environmental decay was similar or even better than creosote impregnated wood. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{leaching}} efficiency of vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) from stone coal and to reduce its connected environmental pollution, this article investigated the oxidizing roasting of stone coal in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor to optimize the roasting method and conditions. The examined parameters included reaction temperature, reaction time and amount and mixing method of additive. The removal of Cl from the generated effluent gas was implemented using CaO as the adsorbent, and comparison was made between the fluidized bed roasting and static roasting in a <b>muffle</b> <b>oven.</b> The {{results show that the}} fluidized roasting is more favorable to leach V 2 O 5 from stone coal, which can shorten roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, while the realized leaching rate is also higher. Comparing the mixing method applied to stone coal and additive, the impregnation method of additive on stone coal not only increased the leaching rate and shortened the roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, but also reduced the amount of additive required. Adding CaO in stone coal roasting sharply decreased the content of Cl-containing gases in flue gas, which can greatly alleviate the possible environmental pollution. The optimal conditions for fluidized bed roasting were found to be impregnating 6 wt. % additive on coal, adding 3 wt. % CaO and performing roasting at 800 degrees C for 0. 75 h.

40|$|Metamorphosis in {{response}} to bottom sediment was measured in two species of marine planktonic larvae. Ilyanassa obsoleta, a common mud-snail, and Capitella sp. I, a polychaete worm. A sediment control consisted of organic-rich sediment collected from Barnstable Harbor, Ma. One sediment treatment, termed muffled sediment, consisted of the sediment control heated at a high temperature in a <b>muffle</b> <b>oven</b> to remove all organic matter. A sharp decrease in percent metamorphosis was observed in larvae exposed to the muffled sediment condition compared to the sediment control. Results confirmed that settlement involves more than physical contact with the sediment and suggest that the metamorphosis-stimulating factor is probably a water soluble substance. The June 10, 1990, spilI of 7, 500 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil into Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, provided oil contaminated samples of salt marsh sediment. Both the sediment control and muffled sediment were contaminated with the oil. The influence of oiled conditions on percent larval metamorphosis varied between species. Ilyanassa obsoleta showed no significant change (ANOVA ~= 0. 01) in percent metamorphosis between the oiled and unoiled conditions. In Capitel la sp. I, larval settlement rates on oiled sediment conditions were {{significantly lower than the}} control sediment. This trend suggests that the oil somehow altered the metamorphosis cue detected by larvae of Capitel la sp. I.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{chemical activation}} of low-grade phosphorite from Karakalpakstan, Khojakul by ammonium salts {{in order to}} obtain slow-acting phosphate fertilizers. Study Design: The content of the total form N (Nt.) was determined by method Kjeldahl method. Determination of total and acceptable forms (on 0. 2 M solution of Trilon B) of phosphorus (P 2 O 5 tot., P 2 O 5 wat.) was performed widely in the analysis of phosphate ores by differential method on photo colour meter PCM- 3 (made in Russia, l = 440 nm) as phosphorus-vanadium-molybdenum complex. This method is based on measuring the light transmission of yellow phosphorus-vanadium-molybdenum complex relative to the reference solution containing a certain amount of phosphates. The method allows analyzing the products with a relative error of determining ± 1 %. The activation rate (Ka) was defined by relation acceptable P 2 O 5 form to total P 2 O 5 form. Decarbonization degree (Kd) was determined by changing C 02 in the phosphate rock and final product. pH of ammonium salts solution and final products were defined after their agitation in 10 % distiller water suspension. Further suspension obtained was measured by potentiometric method on ionomer I- 130 M (made in Russia) with electrode system of electrodes ESL 63 - 07, EVL- 1 M 3. 1. Place and Duration of Study: The laboratory of phosphate fertilizers of the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry under Academy Science of the Republic of Uzbekistan, from July to August in 2016. Methodology: Model laboratory device that obtains fertilizers consists of five-liter screw mixer made from stainless steel 12 X 18 H 10 T equipped with stirrer, moved by electric motor. The laboratorial experiment is done in the following way: in the beginning measured sample of phosphorite was charged in screw mixer and then it was fed to 2, 5, 10 and 20 % of ammonia solutions at different ratios proportions of mineral fertilizers (MF) and phosphorite powder (PHP), for 30 min with vigorous stirring components. Products obtained from interaction of components were analyzed for nitrogen content and different forms of phosphorus. The weight ratio of MF:PHP was in the range from 1 : 1 to 1 : 10. After completing activation process for 30 minute, wet products were dried in <b>muffle</b> <b>oven</b> at 90 °C until dry condition. Results: The chemical compositions of final products were determined during the experiment. Based on chemical activation of low-grade phosphorite fertilizers containing high acceptable form of phosphorus (v) oxide (P 2 O 5) can be obtained. It had been found that degree of activation (Ka) of phosphorite powder depends {{on the nature of the}} ammonium solution and the pH of the medium. Ammonium sulphate is more acidic than ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium chloride. The pH of ammonium sulphate (10 % of its solution) is 3. 80. The decarbonization degree (Kd) of the fertilizers obtained from ammonium sulphate is in a range from 6. 33 to 35. 39 %, which is higher than for other types. Therefore, there had been obtained the fertilizers containing high acceptable form of phosphorus (v) oxide in a range 35. 30 – 59. 07 %. It was revealed that the more phosphate raw is used for activation process, the less is acceptable P 2 O 5 in fertilizers obtained. Moreover, the fertilizers have high content of nitrogen, depending on the type of ammonium salts used, in a range 1. 06 – 17. 33 % in the composition. Conclusion: Based on the results it is possible to obtain effective slow-acting complex phosphate fertilizers with different ratios of nutrients by the activation of low-grade phosphate rock from Karakalpakstan, which do not have an industrial value, mineral salts, used in agriculture as a standard mineral fertilizer...|$|E
