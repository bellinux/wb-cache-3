40|$|Targeting {{patients}} for multimorbid care management interventions requires accurate and comprehensive assessment of patients' {{need in order}} to direct resources to those who need and can benefit from them the most. <b>Multimorbid</b> <b>patient</b> selection is complicated {{due to the lack of}} clear criteria - unlike disease management programs for which patients with a specific condition are identified. This ambiguity can potentially result in inequitable selection, as biases in selection may differentially affect patients from disadvantaged population groups. Patient selection could in principal be performed in three ways: physician referral, patient screening surveys, or by statistical prediction algorithms. This paper discusses equity issues related to each method. We conclude that each method may result in inequitable selection and bias, such as physicians' attentiveness or familiarity, or prediction models' reliance on prior resource use, potentially affected by socio-cultural and economic barriers. These biases should be acknowledged and dealt with. We recommend combining patient selection approaches to achieve high care sensitivity, efficiency and equity...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can be challenging, {{especially in elderly}} multimorbid patients. Since incidence and prevalence rates of IBD are rising steadily, {{treatment of}} older patients with relevant and also rare comorbidities will be of increasing relevancy for caregivers. Here we report on a 74 -year-old <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patient</b> with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hemophilia A. Because of the chronic active disease, therapy with a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor was started. He suffered from a severe infectious complication (pneumonia) under therapy with infliximab. The therapy was changed to vedolizumab, with which the patient stayed in long-term clinical and endoscopic remission. Because the patient had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in April 2016, he received dual platelet inhibitor therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Because of consecutive aspirin intolerance, the therapy was changed to clopidogrel monotherapy. Although the UC was treated appropriately with vedolizumab and the patient was in endoscopic mucosal remission, recurrent bleeding episodes from multiple inflammatory pseudopolyps occurred. The bleeding episodes resolved quickly after immediate treatment with factor VIII (Kogenate®). In conclusion, we describe the first patient in the literature with UC and hemophilia A who stayed in long-term remission under therapy with vedolizumab. From our point of view, vedolizumab can be safely administered {{in the setting of}} UC and hemophilia A. Antiplatelet drugs which inhibit primary hemostasis must be used with caution in this setting. Bleeding episodes can be treated safely and effectively with factor VIII (Kogenate®) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To examine {{health care}} {{utilization}} {{of people with}} multiple chronic diseases in The Netherlands compared to people with a single chronic disease, and to identify subgroups of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> according to health care utilization. Methods: All patients diagnosed {{with one or more}} chronic diseases in 2008 – 2009 (N =  54, 051) were selected from the nationwide NIVEL Primary Care Database, and data on their GP contacts and medication in 2010 were retrieved. Data on hospital admissions, household size and income were added. Chi-square-tests and multivariate regression analyses were performed to analyze differences between <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> and patients with a single chronic disease, and between subgroups of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> derived from cluster analysis. Results: <b>Multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> (37 % of all patients) had more GP contacts, prescribed medications, and hospital admissions (all p < . 0001) than patients with a single chronic disease. The largest cluster of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> (57 %) had a relatively low level of health care utilization, a smaller cluster (36 %) had higher levels of health care utilization, and 7. 6 % of patients were heavy health care users (p < . 0001 for all variables). The latter were older, more often female, had a lower income, lived in a smaller household, had more chronic diseases, and more often had specific chronic diseases such as COPD, diabetes and heart failure. Conclusions: The majority of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> have only slightly higher health care utilization than patients with a single chronic disease. Extensive health care utilization among <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> seems to be related to patient characteristics as well as chronic disease numbers and patterns. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{multimorbidity}} have complex {{health needs}} but, {{due to the}} current traditional disease-oriented approach, they face a highly fragmented form of care that leads to inefficient, ineffective, andpossibly harmful clinical interventions. There is limited evidence on available integrated and multidi-mensional care pathways for <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> An expert consensus meeting was held to develop aframework for care of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> {{that can be applied}} across Europe, within a project fundedby the European Union; the Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across theLife Cycle (JA-CHRODIS).

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop an intervention to support patient-centred prescribing {{in the context of}} multimorbidity in primary care. Methods A range of research methods were used to address different components of the Medical Research Council, UK (MRC) guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions in health care. The existing evidence on GPs’ perceptions of the management of multimorbidity was systematically reviewed. In qualitative interviews, chart-stimulated recall was used to explore the challenges experienced by GPs when prescribing for multimorbid patients. In a cross-sectional study, the psychosocial issues that complicate the management of multimorbidity were examined. To develop the complex intervention, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) was used to integrate behavioural theory with the findings of these three studies. A feasibility study of the new intervention was then conducted with GPs. Results The systematic review revealed four domains of clinical practice where GPs experienced difficulties in multimorbidity. The qualitative interview study showed that GPs responded to these difficulties by ‘satisficing’. In multimorbid patients perceived as stable, GPs preferred to ‘maintain the status quo’ rather than actively change medications. In the cross-sectional study, the significant association between multimorbidity and negative psychosocial factors was shown. These findings informed the development of the ‘Multimorbidity Collaborative Medication Review and Decision-making’ (MY COMRADE) intervention. The intervention involves peer support: two GPs review the medications prescribed to a complex <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patient</b> together. In the feasibility study, GPs reported that the intervention was appropriate for the context of general practice; was widely applicable to their patients with multimorbidity; and recommendations for optimising medications arose from all collaborative reviews. Conclusion Applying theory to empirical data has led to an intervention that is implementable in clinical practice, and has the potential to positively change GPs’ behaviour in the management of medications for patients with multimorbidity...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess and}} compare the self-perceived Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> and the general {{population}} using health utilities (HU) and visual analogue scale (VAS) methods. We analyzed data (n = 888) from a national, cross-sectional Swiss study of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> recruited in primary care settings. Self-perceived HRQoL was assessed using the EQ- 5 D- 3 L instrument, composed of 1) a questionnaire on the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (EQ- 5 D dimensions), and 2) a 0 - 100 (0 = worst- and 100 = best-imaginable health status) VAS. We described the EQ- 5 D dimensions and VAS and computed HU using a standard pan-European value set. HU and VAS are the two components of the overall HRQoL assessment. We examined the proportions of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> reporting problems (moderate/severe) in each EQ- 5 D dimension, corresponding proportions without problems, and mean HU and VAS values across patient characteristics. To test differences between subgroups, we used chi-square tests for dichotomous outcomes and T-tests (ANOVA if more than two groups) for continuous outcomes. Finally, we compared observed and predicted HU and VAS values. All 888 participants answered every EQ- 5 D item. Mean (SD) HU and VAS values were 0. 70 (0. 18) and 63. 2 (19. 2), respectively. HU and VAS were considerably and significantly lower in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> than {{in the general population}} and were also lower in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> below 60 years old and in women. Differences between observed and predicted means (SD) were - 0. 07 (0. 18) for HU and - 11. 8 (20. 3) for VAS. Self-perceived HRQoL is considerably and significantly affected by multimorbidity. More attention should be given to developing interventions that improve the HRQoL of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients,</b> particularly women and those aged below 60 years old...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{health-related}} {{needs of people}} with multiple chronic diseases in the Netherlands compared to people with one chronic disease, and to identify different subgroups of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> based on differences in their health problems. Methods: Participants were 1092 people {{with one or more}} chronic diseases of a nationwide prospective panel study on the consequences of chronic illness in the Netherlands. They completed the EQ- 6 D, a multi-dimensional questionnaire on health problems (October 2013). Chi-square tests and analyses of variance were performed to test for differences between <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> and patients with one chronic disease. To identify subgroups of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients,</b> cluster analysis was performed and differences in EQ- 6 D scores between clusters were tested with Chi-square tests. Results: <b>Multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> (51 % of the total sample) experience more problems in most health domains than patients with one chronic disease. Almost half (44 %) of the multimorbid people had many health problems in different domains. These people were more often female, had a smaller household size, had a lower health literacy, and suffered from more chronic diseases. Remarkably, a small subgroup of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> (4 %, mostly elderly males) is characterized by all having cognitive problems. Conclusions: Based on the problems they experience, we conclude that patients with multimorbidity have relatively many and diverse health-related needs. Extensive health-related needs among people with multimorbidity may relate not only to the number of chronic diseases they suffer from, but also to their patient characteristics. This should be taken into account, when identifying target groups for comprehensive support programmes. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge about {{predictors}} of health-related {{quality of life}} for <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care could help to improve quality and patient-centeredness of care in this specific group of patients. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of several patient characteristics on health-related quality of life of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a community setting. A cross-sectional study with 32 primary care practice teams in Mannheim, Germany, and randomly selected <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 495) was conducted. In order to analyze associations of various patient characteristics with health-related quality of life (EQ- 5 D index) a multilevel analysis was applied. After excluding patients with missing data, the cohort consisted of 404 eligible patients. The final multilevel model highlighted six out of 14 explanatory patient variables which were significantly associated with health-related quality of life: female gender (r = - 0. 0494; p =. 0261), school education of nine years or less (r = - 0. 0609; p =. 0006), (physical) mobility restrictions (r = - 0. 1074; p =. 0003), presence of chronic pain (r = - 0. 0916; p =. 0004), diabetes-related distress (r = - 0. 0133; p <. 0001), and BMI (r = - 0. 0047; p =. 0045). The findings of this study suggest that increased diabetes-related distress, chronic pain, restrictions in (physical) mobility, female gender, as well as lower education and, increased BMI have a noteworthy impact on health-related quality of life in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes mellitus seen in primary care practices in a community setting. The highlighted aspects should gain much more attention when treating <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{develop and}} {{optimise}} a primary care-based complex intervention (CARE Plus) {{to enhance the}} quality of life of patients with multimorbidity in the deprived areas. METHODS Six co-design discussion groups involving 32 participants were held separately with <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> from the deprived areas, voluntary organisations, general practitioners and practice nurses working in the deprived areas. This was followed by piloting in two practices and further optimisation based on interviews with 11 general practitioners, 2 practice nurses and 6 participating <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> RESULTS Participants endorsed the need for longer consultations, relational continuity and a holistic approach. All felt that training and support of the health care staff was important. Most participants welcomed the idea of additional self-management support, though some practitioners were dubious about whether patients would use it. The pilot study led to changes including a revised care plan, the inclusion of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques in the support of practitioners and patients, and the stream-lining of the written self-management support material for patients.

40|$|Introduction: The {{likelihood}} of developing {{two or more}} chronic illnesses (‘multimorbidity’) increases with age. Depression is common with chronic physical illness, but may not be detected or treated in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> This thesis is comprised {{of a series of}} related studies designed to explore the prevalence, diagnosis and management of depression in patients with multiple chronic conditions using an explanatory mixed methods design. Data and participants were sourced from a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic in metropolitan Adelaide. Study One: Clinic Database Analysis. The study estimated the prevalence of a) depression diagnoses and b) depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in an outpatient clinic population, exploring agreement between clinician diagnoses of depression and GDS scores. Doctor-diagnosed depression was recorded for 15 % of patients. Based on GDS scores, 50 % of patients reported threshold-level depression symptoms, although many had no corresponding depression diagnosis. This suggests that whilst many <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> experience depressive symptoms, these may not be detected. Study Two: Comparing the GDS, HADS and CIDI. Study Two compared GDS scores with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) diagnoses. The GDS identified more depression-positive cases than the HADS and the CIDI, but the CIDI failed to detect severe depressive symptoms in several patients. During the study, concerns arose relating {{to the use of the}} CIDI with older multimorbid patients; consequently, the study was terminated early. Study Three: Patient Symptom Priority Scale. The Patient Symptom Priority Scale was developed to explore patient perceptions of symptom burden and functional impact, and piloted in the clinic. Patients described more physical symptoms than emotional symptoms. Age correlated positively with chronic illness and physical symptom counts, and negatively with psychological symptom impact. Geriatric Depression Scale scores correlated with all psychological variables. Study Four: GP experiences of depression diagnosis and management with <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs who had referred patients to the clinic, to explore GP perceptions of depression diagnosis and treatment with <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> and generate a grounded theory model reflecting the role of multimorbidity in their practice. Multimorbidity generated increased time to determine symptom causation and build relationship with the patient. GPs offered medical and social depression interventions. Study Five: Experiences of depression diagnosis and treatment amongst <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> To explore the patient perspective, further qualitative interviews were undertaken with <b>multimorbid</b> clinic <b>patients</b> who had been diagnosed with depression. Thematic analysis revealed common diagnosis and treatment experiences amongst these <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with depression. All patients attributed depression onset to the loss of their normal life, with stigma emerging as an underlying influence in patient decisions about treatment. Conclusion: This is the first study to compare depression symptoms with depression diagnoses in a multimorbid population, and found that many patients experience threshold-level depression symptoms that are not being addressed. General practitioners are aware of contextual factors, and try to address them, but also make assumptions about their patients that may not be accurate. This may account for the number of patients still suffering. The findings suggest that a thorough symptom profile is necessary for effective detection and treatment of depression in this vulnerable population. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|To characterise in details {{a random}} sample of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> in Switzerland and to {{evaluate}} the clustering of chronic conditions in that sample. 100 general practitioners (GPs) each enrolled 10 randomly selected <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> aged ≥ 18 years old and suffering from at least three chronic conditions. The prevalence of 75 separate chronic conditions from the International Classification of Primary Care- 2 (ICPC- 2) was evaluated in these patients. Clusters of chronic conditions were studied in parallel. The final database included 888 patients. Mean (SD) patient age was 73. 0 (12. 0) years old. They suffered from 5. 5 (2. 2) chronic conditions and were prescribed 7. 7 (3. 5) drugs; 25. 7 % suffered from depression. Psychological conditions were more prevalent among younger individuals (≤ 66 years old). Cluster analysis of chronic conditions with a prevalence ≥ 5 % in the sample revealed four main groups of conditions: (1) cardiovascular risk factors and conditions, (2) general age-related and metabolic conditions, (3) tobacco and alcohol dependencies, and (4) pain, musculoskeletal and psychological conditions. Given the emerging epidemic of multimorbidity in industrialised countries, accurately depicting the multiple expressions of multimorbidity in family practices' patients is a high priority.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{explored}} {{experiences of}} depression {{diagnosis and treatment}} amongst <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> referred to a metropolitan multidisciplinary outpatient clinic to identify commonalities across this patient group. METHODS: Patients with two or more chronic conditions and a diagnosis of depression participated in semi-structured interviews that were digitally recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis {{was performed on the}} transcriptions. RESULTS: <b>Multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> attributed depressive symptoms to the loss of 'normal' roles and functionality and struggled to reconcile the depression diagnosis with their sense of identity. Beliefs about themselves and depression affected their receptivity to diagnosis and intervention strategies. These included prescribed interventions, such as psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, and patient-developed strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Functional and social role losses present a clear context in which GPs should raise the subject of mood, with the situational attribution of depression suggesting that psychotherapy, which is rarely offered, should be prioritised in these circumstances.

40|$|Background: It is {{not well}} {{established}} how psychosocial factors like social support and depression affect health-related {{quality of life in}} <b>multimorbid</b> and elderly <b>patients.</b> We investigated whether depressive mood mediates the influence of social support on health-related quality of life. Methods: Cross-sectional data of 3, 189 <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> from the baseline assessment of the German MultiCare cohort study were used. Mediation was tested using the approach described by Baron and Kenny based on multiple linear regression, and controlling for socioeconomic variables and burden of multimorbidity. Results: Mediation analyses confirmed that depressive mood mediates the influence of social support on health-related quality of life (Sobel's p < 0. 001). Multiple linear regression showed that the influence of depressive mood (beta = - 0. 341, p < 0. 01) on health-related quality of life is greater than the influence of multimorbidity (beta = - 0. 234, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Social support influences health-related quality of life, but this association is strongly mediated by depressive mood.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{for the management of}} complex health care interventions within the Deming continuous improvement cycle and to test the framework {{in the case of an}} integrated intervention for <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> in the Basque Country within the CareWell project. MethodsStatistical analysis alone, although necessary, may not always represent the practical significance of the intervention. Thus, to ascertain the true economic impact of the intervention, the statistical results can be integrated into the budget impact analysis. The intervention of the case study consisted of a comprehensive approach that integrated new provider roles and new technological infrastructure for <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients,</b> with the aim of reducing patient decompensations by 10 % over 5 years. The study period was 2012 to 2020. ResultsGiven the aging of the general population, the conventional scenario predicts an increase of 21 % in the health care budget for care of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> during the study period. With a successful intervention, this figure should drop to 18 %. The statistical analysis, however, showed no significant differences in costs either in primary care or in hospital care between 2012 and 2014. The real costs in 2014 were by far closer to those in the conventional scenario than to the reductions expected in the objective scenario. The present implementation should be reappraised, because the present expenditure did not move closer to the objective budget.

A multiple linear regression model was used to determine {{the impact of}} social support and sense of coherence on the health-related quality of life while controlling for age, sex, educational level, marital status and number of chronic conditions. In the final regression model, higher sense of coherence scores were associated with higher health-related quality of life scores (standardized ss 0. 34, p < 0. 001) whereas a higher number of chronic conditions was associated with lower health-related quality of life scores (standardized ss - 0. 41, p < 0. 001). In the bivariate model, higher perceived social support was associated with higher health-related quality of life scores (standardized ss 0. 35, p < 0. 001), whereas the model failed to show a significant association after controlling for sense of coherence which is a potential resource for improving health-related quality of life in <b>multimorbid</b> primary care <b>patients.</b> It emerged as a significant element contributing to the prediction of health-related quality of life.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{describes}} “Guided Care, ” a promising {{new model of}} case management that includes disease management, self-management, transitional care, and caregiver support for <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> and their families. Primary Practice Settings: Guided Care nurses, based at primary care practices, extend services to the home {{and all the other}} settings where their patients receive care. Findings and Conclusions: Guided Care nurses take responsibility for 50 — 60 <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> For each patient, the nurse performs a home assessment and creates an evidence-based plan of care. In partnership with the primary physician, the Guided Care nurse then monitors and coaches the patient monthly, coordinates the patient’s transitions between providers and sites of care, educates and supports family caregivers, and facilitates access to community resources. Implications for Case Management Practice: As a next stage in the evolution of case management, Guided Care may be supported by Medicare and, therefore, adopted widely throughout the American healthcare.

40|$|Background: Valvular aortic {{stenosis}} {{is a common}} disease in the elderly, often in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> It {{is often associated with}} coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. In this situation, the risk of conventional open-heart surgery is too high, and other treatment strategies have to be evaluated. Case report: A 79 -year-old female patient with severe {{aortic stenosis}}, coronary artery disease and end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffering from dyspnea at rest and permanently dependent on oxygen was treated in three steps. Firstly, her pulmonary infection was treated with antibiotics for 7 days. Then, the left anterior descending artery was stented (bare-metal stent). In the same session, valvuloplasty of the aortic valve was performed. She was sent to rehabilitation to improve her pulmonary condition and took clopidogrel for 4 weeks. Finally, she underwent transapical aortic valve replacement. She was released to rehabilitation on postoperative day 12.

We conducted a retrospective study with all multimorbid inpatients aged ≥ 18 years admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine of University Hospital Zurich in 2011 (n = 1, 039 patients). Data were extracted from the electronic health records and reviewed. We identified 433 hospitalizations of patients with chronic pain and analyzed their combinations of chronic conditions (multimorbidity). We then classified all analgesic prescriptions according to the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder. Furthermore, we used a Swiss drug-drug interactions knowledge base to identify potential interactions between opioids and other drug classes, in particular coanalgesics and other concomitant drugs. Chronic pain was present in 38 % of patients with multimorbidity. On average, patients with chronic pain were aged 65. 7 years and had a mean number of 6. 6 diagnoses. Hypertension was the most common chronic condition. Chronic back pain was the most common painful condition. Almost 90 % of patients were exposed to polypharmacotherapy. Of the chronic pain patients, 71. 1 % received opioids for moderate to severe pain, 43. 4 % received coanalgesics. We identified 3, 186 potential drug-drug interactions, with 17 % classified between analgesics (without coanalgesics). Analgesic drugs-related DDIs, in particular opioids, in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> are often complex and difficult to assess by using DDI knowledge bases alone. Drug-multimorbidity interactions are not sufficiently investigated and understood. Today, the scientific literature is scarce for chronic pain in combination with multiple coexisting medical conditions and medication regimens.

40|$|Care {{management}} {{is seen as}} a promising approach to address the complex care needs of patients with multimorbidity. Predictive modeling based on insurance claims data is an emerging concept to identify patients likely to benefit from care management interventions. We aimed to identify and explore patterns of multimorbidity in primary care patients with high predicted risk of future hospitalizations in order to develop a primary care-based care management intervention. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess insurance claims data of 6026 patients from 10 primary care practices in Germany. We stratified the population by the predicted likelihood of hospitalization (LOH) using a diagnostic cost group-based case-finding software. Co-occurrence of chronic conditions in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with an upper-quartile LOH score was explored by extraction of mutually exclusive patterns. Predictive modeling identified <b>multimorbid</b> elderly <b>patients</b> with a high number of co-occurring chronic conditions (mean number 7. 8 [SD 3. 1]). Assessing co-occurrence of highly prevalent chronic conditions in 1407 <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> with upper-quartile LOH revealed 471 mutually exclusive patterns with low single frequencies. The observed prevalence significantly exceeded expected prevalence for patterns with causal comorbidity. Additionally, chronic pain (related to osteoarthritis) or depression could be identified as discordant co-occurring conditions in 80 % (12 / 15) of the most common multimorbidity patterns. High-risk primary care patients suffer from heterogeneous individual patterns of co-occurring chronic conditions. Care management interventions will have to account for discordant co-occurring conditions such as osteoarthritis and depression...|$|R

40|$|Multimorbidity’s high {{prevalence}} and negative impact {{has made it}} a subject of worldwide interest. The main {{aim of this study}} was to access the Portuguese knowledge, awareness, and practices of general practitioners (GPs) regarding multimorbidity and its management, in order to aid in the development of interventions for improving outcomes in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> in primary care. A web-based qualitative descriptive study was carried out in the first trimester of 2016 with primary care physicians working in two districts of the Centre region of Portugal. Open-ended questions were analysed via inductive thematic content analysis. GPs pointed out several difficulties and challenges while managing multimorbidity. Extrinsic factors were associated with the healthcare system logistics’ management (consultation time, organization of care teams, clinical information) and society (media pressure, social/family support). Intrinsic factors related to the GP, patient, and physician-patient relationship were also stated. The most significant conclusion to emerge from this study is that although GPs perceived difficulties and challenges towards multimorbidity, they also have the tools to deal with them: the fundamental characteristics of family medicine. Also, the complex care required by <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> needs adequate consultation time, multidisciplinary teamwork, and more education/training...|$|R

40|$|Multimorbidity is {{a growing}} issue and poses a major {{challenge}} to health care systems around the world. Multimorbidity is related to ageing but many studies have now shown that it is also socially patterned, being more common and occurring {{at an earlier age}} in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. There is lack of research on patients with multimorbidity, and thus guidelines are based on single-conditions. Polypharmacy is common in multimorbidity, increasing drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. <b>Multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> need holistic care, but secondary care services are highly specialised and thus are often duplicative and fragmented and thus increase treatment burden in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> The cost of care is high in multimorbidity, due to high rates of primary and secondary care consultations and unplanned hospital admissions. The combination of mental and physical conditions increases complexity of care, and costs. Mental-physical multimorbidity is especially common in deprived areas. General practitioners and primary care teams have a key role in managing patients with multimorbidity, using a patient-centred generalist approach. Consultation length and continuity of care may need to be substantially enhanced in order to enable such patients. This will require a radical change in how health care systems are organised and funded in order to effectively meet the challenges of multimorbidity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Multimorbidity has a {{negative}} impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL). Previous studies included {{only a limited number of}} conditions. In this study, we analyse the impact of a large number of conditions on HRQL in <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> without preselecting particular diseases. We also explore the effects of these conditions on the specific dimensions of HRQL. Materials and Methods: This analysis is based on a multicenter, prospective cohort study of 3189 <b>multimorbid</b> primary care <b>patients</b> aged 65 to 85. The impact of 45 conditions on HRQL was analysed. The severity of the conditions was rated. The EQ- 5 D, consisting of 5 dimensions and a visual-analogue-scale (EQ VAS), was employed. Data were analysed using multiple ordinary least squares and multiple logistic regressions. Multimorbidity measured by a weighted count score wa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Multimorbidity is a {{phenomenon}} with high burden and high prevalence in the elderly. Our previous {{research has shown that}} multimorbidity can be divided into the multimorbidity patterns of 1) anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders (ADS) and pain, and 2) cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. However, it is not yet known, how these patterns are influenced by patient characteristics. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the association of socio-demographic variables, and especially socio-economic status with multimorbidity in general and with each multimorbidity pattern. Methods The MultiCare Cohort Study is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study of 3. 189 <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> aged 65 + randomly selected from 158 GP practices. Data were collected in GP interviews and comprehensive patient interviews. Missing values have been imputed by hot deck imputation based on Gower distance in morbidity and other variables. The association of patient characteristics with the number of chronic conditions is analysed by multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analyses. Results Multimorbidity in general is associated with age (+ 0. 07 chronic conditions per year), gender (- 0. 27 conditions for female), education (- 0. 26 conditions for medium and - 0. 29 conditions for high level vs. low level) and income (- 0. 27 conditions per logarithmic unit). The pattern of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders shows comparable associations with a higher coefficient for gender (- 1. 29 conditions for female), while multimorbidity within the pattern of ADS and pain correlates with gender (+ 0. 79 conditions for female), but not with age or socioeconomic status. Conclusions Our study confirms that the morbidity load of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> is associated with age, gender and the socioeconomic status of the patients, but there were no effects of living arrangements and marital status. We could also show that the influence of patient characteristics is dependent on the multimorbidity pattern concerned, i. e. there seem to be at least two types of elderly <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients.</b> First, there are patients with mainly cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, who are more often male, have an older age and a lower socio-economic status. Second, there are patients mainly with ADS and pain-related morbidity, who are more often female and equally distributed across age and socio-economic groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Comparatively {{few studies}} address the {{problems}} related to multimorbidity. This is surprising, since multimorbidity is a particular challenge for both general practitioners and patients. This study focuses on the latter, analyzing the way patients aged 65 – 85 cope with multimorbidity. Methods 19 narrative in-depth interviews with <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> were conducted. The data was analysed using grounded theory. Of the 19 interviewed patients 13 were female and 6 male. Mean age was 75 [*]years. Participating patients showed a relatively homogeneous socio-economic status. Patients were recruited from the German city of Hamburg {{and the state of}} North Rhine-Westphalia. Results Despite suffering from multimorbidity, interviewees held positive attitudes towards life: At the social level, patients tried to preserve their autonomy to the most possible extent. At the emotional level, interviewees oscillated between anxiety and strength - having, however, a positive approach to life. At the practical level, patients aimed at keeping their diseases under control. The patients tended to be critical in regards to medication. Conclusions These findings might have implications for the treatment of <b>multimorbid</b> <b>patients</b> in primary care and further research: The generally presumed passivity of older individuals towards medical treatment, which can be found in literature, is not evident among our sample of older patients. In future, treatment of these patients might take their potential for pro-active cooperation more strongly into account than it is currently the case. </p...|$|R
