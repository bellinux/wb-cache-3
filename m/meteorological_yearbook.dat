Daily observations are published for 10 measuring stations and monthly and yearly values for 155 stations. Daily sums of global radiation as well as sunshine hours are presented for 6 selected stations of the DWD radiation measuring network. Monthly and yearly precipitation data are presented for all stations; for some stations, also the daily precipitation and snow cover thickness. (orig.)

40|$|The Bachelors thesis Climate of {{the foothills}} of Krkonoše {{mountains}} according to archival sources {{is concerned with the}} study of climate in the northern lower part of The Giant Mountains, it describes important climatic events of this part and focuses particularly on extreme weather changes including atmospheric events. The information provided in this work is predominantly gained from historic sources and <b>meteorological</b> <b>yearbooks.</b> The main focus is on two periods. It briefly describes the period before the Second World War From whitch exist only a few resource, and in much greater detail the period of the years 1945 - 1995. The purpose of this Bachelors thesis, based on examined data and figures, is to generally summarize climate and development of the northern lower part of The Giant Mountains. The work might be later used as one of the many bases for another examination of the influence of. And then you can add touristic manual and books about region...|$|R
40|$|More than 240 {{items of}} {{historical}} records containing climatic information were retrieved from official historical books, local chronicles, annals and regional <b>meteorological</b> disaster <b>yearbooks.</b> By using moisture index and flood/drought (F/D) index {{obtained from the}} above information, the historical climate change, namely wet-dry conditions in borderland of Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (BSGN, mainly included Ningxialu, Hezhoulu, Gongchanglu, Fengyuanlu and Yan'anlu in the Yuan Dynasty) was studied. The {{results showed that the}} climate of the region was generally dry and the ratio between drought and flood disasters was 85 / 38 during the period of 1208 - 1369. According to the frequencies of drought-flood disasters, the whole period could be divided into three phases. (1) 1208 - 1240 : drought dominated the phase with occasional flood disasters. (2) 1240 - 1320 : long-time drought disasters and extreme drought events happened frequently. (3) 1320 - 1369 : drought disasters were less severe when flood and drought disasters happened alternately. Besides, the reconstructed wet-dry change curve revealed obvious transition and periodicity in the Mongol-Yuan Period. The transitions occurred in 1230 and 1325. The wet-dry change revealed 10 - and 23 -year quasi-periods which were consistent with solar cycles, indicating that solar activity had affected the wet-dry conditions of the study region in the Mongol-Yuan Period. The reconstructed results were consistent with two other study results reconstructed from natural evidences, and were similar to another study results from historical documents. All the above results showed that the climate in BSGN was characterized by long-time dry condition with frequent severe drought disasters during 1258 to 1308. Thus, these aspects of climatic changes might have profound impacts on local vegetation and socio-economic system...|$|R
