25|$|The AMA {{has given}} high {{priority}} to supporting changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, {{makes it difficult}} for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high-risk specialists have moved to other states with such limits. For example, in 2004, not a single neurosurgeon remained in the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs of health care and lost income. Multiple states found that limiting pain and suffering costs has dramatically slowed increases in the cost of medical <b>malpractice</b> <b>insurance.</b> The state of Texas enacted such reforms in 2003 and subsequently reported in 2005 that all major malpractice insurers were able to offer either no increase or a decrease in premiums to physicians.|$|E

40|$|Lawsuits {{for medical}} {{malpractice}} {{are supposed to}} serve two purposes: compensation of injured patients and deterrence of negligent conduct by doctors and hospitals. However, those goals are not being served {{in the area of}} obstetric medicine. <b>Malpractice</b> liability <b>insurance</b> premiums are increasing rapidly for obstetric care providers, and as a result, delivery and perinatal care have become more expensive and less available. At the same time, compensation is distributed inequitably.

2500|$|However, even {{successful}} {{tort reform}} might {{not lead to}} lower aggregate liability: for example, medical commentators {{have argued that the}} current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards. A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that [...] "health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and the premiums for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty."

2500|$|Paul has {{proposed}} radical {{changes in the}} way medical malpractice claims are handled.

Multiple guidelines for pain physicians contain many recommendations regarding interventional treatment. Unfortunately, no definite treatment guidelines exist {{because there is}} no complete consensus among individual guidelines. Pain intervention procedures are widely practiced and highly associated with adverse events and complications. However, a comprehensive, systemic review of medical-dispute cases (MDCs) in Korea has not yet been reported.

40|$|This article proposes {{unlimited}} insurance subrogation (UIS) {{to improve}} the insurance and deterrence results of medical <b>malpractice</b> liability. Unlimited <b>insurance</b> subrogation enables patients to assign their entire potential medical malpractice claims to their first-party insurers without limitation as to the amount the insurers pay out in benefits or recover in tort damages. Unlimited insurance subrogation should improve insurance outcomes by converting suboptimal tort insurance into more optimal first-party insurance. Establishing first-party insurers as plaintiffs to confront liability insurers on the defense side should improve deterrence through more effective prosecution of meritorious claims and by harnessing the insurers' incentives for cooperation to reduce meritless and unnecessary litigation.
