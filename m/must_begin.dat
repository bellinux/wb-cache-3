5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|In state-run institutions, {{students}} {{only need}} pay registration fees; {{there are no}} tuition fees. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> to repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, {{if they have been}} working in their trade in the country for at least one year.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.|$|E
50|$|For example, 234-235-5678 {{is a valid}} {{telephone}} number with area code 234, central office prefix 235, and line number 5678. The number 234-911-5678 is invalid, because the central office code must {{not be in the}} form N11. 314-159-2653 is invalid, because the office code <b>must</b> not <b>begin</b> with 1. 123-234-5678 is invalid, because the NPA <b>must</b> not <b>begin</b> with 0 or 1.|$|R
50|$|Membership {{is open to}} all {{who have}} an {{interest}} in music, particularly the music of the guqin, or are qin players/musicians. Members receive regular mailings via e-mail about the society's activities and important upcoming events. There is no formal requirement for members to attend any of the meetings or yajis but they <b>must,</b> <b>beginning</b> January 2011, pay a subscription fee.|$|R

5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{contact edge}} is between Proto-Germanic and Proto-Baltic, which <b>must</b> have <b>begun</b> after 1000.|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} graph theory, {{two of the}} nodes now have degree 2, {{and the other two}} have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but it <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> on one island and end on the other.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 8: Euler walks are {{possible}} if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This {{is a change in}} parity from an odd to even degree.|$|E
25|$|Circlework is {{a method}} {{developed}} by a German-Jewish author and seminar leader, Jalaja Bonheim (www.jalajabonheim.com), which she has been practicing and teaching in the United States for 25 years, and in Israel since 2005. Circlework uses circle gatherings to create a field of open-heartedness and love powerful enough to heal individuals and communities. Circlework {{is based on the}} assumption that the root causes of violence and war lie within us, and that our own consciousness is where change <b>must</b> <b>begin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Acton {{uses the}} Open Town Meeting form of town government. The town charter {{specifies}} that the annual town meeting <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> {{on the first}} Monday in April. The selectmen may also call a special town meeting at other {{times of the year}} to consider other business. Citizens may force a special town meeting by submitting a petition signed by 200 registered voters to the town clerk. Anyone may attend Town Meeting but only registered voters may vote. Acton also has a water district, which is run separately from town government, as a public utility.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one gallon of fuel and see how far they got. Seeing that this would lead to aircraft retrieval problems, the organisers decided that all flights <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> and end at Lypmne. Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a standard amount, landing when they judged they had insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If they had used more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if they had used less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|E

25|$|Back in the Capital, {{everything}} is still quiet. Leonid Gorbovsky, whose Tariel II has delivered scientific equipment to Rainbow, pays {{a visit to}} Matvei Vyazanitsyn, the general director of the planet, then returns to his ship, when the ominous news come. Camill contacts (via videophone) the nearest scientist village and issues a warning that the Wave Sklyarov saw is closely followed by another one of a new type. According to him, it cannot be stopped like the ones before and therefore the Rainbow world council <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> the evacuation of the planet immediately. At this moment the Wave reaches Camill's observation tower and he dies once again.|$|E
25|$|The Griffin family <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> {{living on}} a stricter budget. A local news story on the lottery {{influences}} Peter to buy a ticket in hopes that he will win and set the family on a better financial platform. Peter reveals to his family that he has bought several thousand lottery tickets, admitting that he has taken out a second mortgage on the house in order to buy them. After watching {{the results of the}} lottery that night, they spend three days searching for the lottery tickets, only to discover that the lottery tickets were, in fact, printed by Peter. When the real batch arrives, they discover that they have indeed won it. The family are unable to decide how they should spend all the money, though Lois states that she does not want it to change their lifestyle. Defiant, Peter decides to begin living lavishly, and quits his job.|$|E
25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, what you <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> with is an uneducated child {{from one of}} the most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E
