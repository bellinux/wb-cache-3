2500|$|First {{coined by}} Joseph Nye, the term soft power is used, in {{contrast}} with hard or coercive powers such as military power, to describe a new means of international influence by [...] "attraction" [...] – [...] "the ability of a country to structure a situation so that other countries develop preferences or define their interests in ways consistent with its own". During the 2011 presidential election, Ho Kwon Ping suggested that while the President's [...] "hard powers" [...] are his constitutional duties, he also exercises soft power which manifests in three domains. At the private level, the President <b>may</b> <b>consult</b> the Prime Minister on certain issues; at the bureaucratic level, the President may take an [...] "activist, inquisitive" [...] role towards civil servants; and most contentiously, in the public domain, {{it is up to}} the people (whose mandate confers such soft powers upon the elected President) to decide how much of a voice the President should have. Ho later clarified his stance, explaining his point was that [...] "by virtue of being directly elected, the Elected President (EP) will possess the popular mandate to speak out on issues, so long as they are not politically partisan views". Thio Li-ann expressed a preference for calling it [...] "influence" [...] rather than soft power which is an [...] "imprecise term".
