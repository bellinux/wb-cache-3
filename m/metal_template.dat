5000|$|The {{strength}} of non-covalent interactions in a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture increases {{as compared to}} the non-mechanically bonded analogues. This increased strength is demonstrated by the necessity of harsher conditions to remove a <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> ion from catenanes as opposed to their non-mechanically bonded analogues. This effect {{is referred to as the}} [...] "catenand effect". This increase in {{strength of}} non-covalent interactions is attributed to the loss of degrees of freedom upon the formation of a mechanical bond. The increase in strength of non-covalent interactions is more pronounced on smaller interlocked systems, where more degrees of freedom are lost, as compared to larger mechanically interlocked systems where the change in degrees of freedom is lower. Therefore if the ring in a rotaxane is made smaller the strength of non-covalent interactions increases, the same effect is observed if the thread is made smaller as well.|$|E

40|$|Active <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> {{synthesis}} is {{a powerful}} new strategy {{for the construction of}} rotaxanes, catenanes and other mechanically interlocked molecular structures. The key feature is that the metal plays a dual role during the assembly of the interlocked architecture, acting as both a template for entwining or threading the components and as a catalyst for capturing the interlocked final product by covalent bond formation. Unlike traditional "passive" <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> methods to rotaxanes and catenanes, permanent recognition motifs are not required on each of the components to be interlocked (i. e., the assembly can be traceless) and the template can often be used in sub-stoichiometric quantities. Since its inception in 2006, a rapidly growing number of different metal-catalysed reactions have proven suitable for the active <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> synthesis of both rotaxanes and catenanes, including the copper(I) -catalysed terminal alkyne—azide cycloaddition (the CuAAC "click" reaction), palladium- and copper-catalysed alkyne homocouplings and heterocouplings, and palladium-catalysed oxidative Heck couplings and Michael additions. In addition to simple rotaxanes and catenanes, the synthetic strategy has been used to construct switchable molecular shuttles with weak intercomponent interactions (a requirement for fast shuttling) and to provide insight into the mechanisms of transition metal-catalysed reactions. In this tutorial review we highlight the utility and potential of the early examples of the active <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> strategy in mechanically interlocked molecule synthesis. 12 page(s...|$|E

A 3 D metal printing-selective laser melting (SLM) technique was employed to directly fabricate the 316 L stainless steel template, and the <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> with tiny locating holes was used as an auxiliary tool to insert spinal screws inside the patient’s body. To guarantee accurate fabrication of the template for cervical vertebra operation, the contact face was placed upwards to improve the joint quality between the template and the cervical vertebra. The joint surface of the printed template had a roughness of Ra = 13 ± 2 μm. After abrasive blasting, the surface roughness was Ra = 7 ± 0. 5 μm. The surgical <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> was bound with the 3 D-printed Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic model. The micro-hardness values determined at the cross-sections of SLM-processed samples varied from HV 0. 3 250 to HV 0. 3 280, and the measured tensile strength was in the range of 450 MPa to 560 MPa, which showed that the template had requisite strength. Finally, the <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> was clinically used in the patient’s surgical operation, and the screws were inserted precisely as the result of using the auxiliary template. The geometrical parameters of the template hole (e. g., diameter and wall thickness) were optimized, and measures were taken to optimize the key geometrical units (e. g., hole units) in metal 3 D printing. Compared to the traditional technology of screw insertion, the use of the surgical <b>metal</b> <b>template</b> enabled the screws to be inserted more easily and accurately during spinal surgery. However, the design of the high-quality template should fully take into account the clinical demands of surgeons, as well as the advice of the designing engineers and operating technicians...|$|E

Synthesis of novel threedimensional (3 D) nanostructures of graphene would be an important advance for fundamental research and various applications. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of fabricating complex 3 D graphene nanostructures by growing graphene on pre-synthesized nanostructured <b>metal</b> <b>templates</b> by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then etching away the metal. In the proof-of-concept experiments, we study this idea using two types of metal nanostructures, inverse opals and slanted nanopillar arrays grown by a glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. Due to the elevated temperatures used in typical CVD growth, nanostructures can be easily damaged during the growth process. Therefore, we systematically study the roles of different parameters, such as the composition, morphology and crystallinity of a nanostructured metal, {{as well as the}} CVD growth temperature and different carbon sources to grow graphene on metal nanostructures {{and at the same time}} preserve their integrity. In particular, we show that nanostructures with large crystalline domains can withstand high temperature CVD, whereas polycrystalline nanostructures, such as nanopillars grown by GLAD, suffer damage even at the low growth temperature of 500 °C. In the case of such thermally sensitive nanostructures, a careful selection of a highly reactive carbon source that could form graphene at lower temperatures becomes crucial. Furthermore, the selection of a metal is also important, as cobalt nanostructures are shown to be more resistant to thermal damage than their nickel counterparts. Finally, we could successfully remove the nanostructured <b>metal</b> <b>templates</b> to form free-standing graphene-based inverse opals and hollow graphene nanopillars.
