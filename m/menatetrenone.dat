50|$|Vitamin K2, {{the main}} storage form in animals, has several subtypes, which differ in isoprenoid chain length. These vitamin K2 homologues are called menaquinones, and are {{characterized}} {{by the number of}} isoprenoid residues in their side chains. Menaquinones are abbreviated MK-n, where M stands for menaquinone, the K stands for vitamin K, and the n represents the number of isoprenoid side chain residues. For example, menaquinone-4 (abbreviated MK-4) has four isoprene residues in its side chain. Menaquinone-4 (also known as <b>menatetrenone</b> from its four isoprene residues) is {{the most common type of}} vitamin K2 in animal products since MK-4 is normally synthesized from vitamin K1 in certain animal tissues (arterial walls, pancreas, and testes) by replacement of the phytyl tail with an unsaturated geranylgeranyl tail containing four isoprene units, thus yielding menaquinone-4. This homolog of vitamin K2 may have enzyme functions distinct from those of vitamin K1.|$|E

We examined whether administration of <b>menatetrenone</b> (vitamin K 2) improves bone metabolism in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Administration of a single dose of <b>menatetrenone</b> (15 mg) revealed that the 24 -h pharmacodynamics in CAPD patients were comparable to those in control individuals. In a 12 -month period of oral <b>menatetrenone</b> administration (45 mg/day), eight stable CAPD patients were studied for blood–bone metabolism parameters and for bone mineral content. Blood concentration of <b>menatetrenone</b> was detectable during the experiment period. Only at 12 months did active vitamin D 3 and bone-type alkaline phosphatase (ALP) fall significantly, while total ALP rose significantly. Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorp-tiometry remained at the same level throughout the study period, suggesting that <b>menatetrenone</b> may protect against bone mineral loss in CAPD patients. These results show that the same dose of oral <b>menatetrenone</b> can be given to CAPD patients as to control individuals, and that <b>menatetrenone</b> can be used safely for 1 year in CAPD patients...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. <b>Menatetrenone</b> is the brand name of a synthetic vitamin K 2 that is chemically identical to menaquinone- 4. The present review study aimed to clarify the effect of <b>menatetrenone</b> on the skeleton in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, by reviewing the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the literature. RCTs that investigated the effect of <b>menatetrenone</b> on bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, were identified by a PubMed search for literature published in English. Eight studies met the criteria for RCTs. Small RCTs showed that <b>menatetrenone</b> monotherapy decreased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) concentrations, modestly increased lumbar spine BMD, and reduced the incidence of fractures (mainly vertebral fracture), and that combined alendronate and <b>menatetrenone</b> therapy enhanced the decrease in serum ucOC concentrations and further increased femoral neck BMD. This review of the literature revealed positive evidence for the effects of <b>menatetrenone</b> monotherapy on fracture incidence in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Further studies are required to clarify the efficacy of <b>menatetrenone</b> in combination with bisphosphonates against fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis...|$|E

Method: This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, noninferiority, positive drug-controlled clinical trial was conducted in five Chinese sites. Eligible Chinese women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (N= 236) were randomized to Group M or Group A and received <b>menatetrenone</b> 45 mg/day or alfacalcidol 0. 5 µg/day, respectively, for 1 year. Additionally, all patients received calcium 500 mg/day. Posttreatment bone mineral density (BMD), new fracture onsets, and serum osteocalcin (OC) and undercarboxylated OC (ucOC) levels were compared with the baseline value in patients of both groups. Results: A total of 213 patients (90. 3 %) completed the study. After 1 year of treatment, BMD among patients in Group M significantly increased from baseline by 1. 2 % and 2. 7 % at the lumbar spine and trochanter, respectively (P 0. 05). In Group M, OC and ucOC decreased from baseline by 38. 7 % and 82. 3 %, respectively (P< 0. 001). In Group A, OC and ucOC decreased by 25. 8 % and 34. 8 %, respectively (P< 0. 001). Decreases in serum OC and ucOC were more obvious in Group M than in Group A (P< 0. 001). The safety profile of <b>menatetrenone</b> was similar to alfacalcidol.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to clarify the efficacy of interventions intended to prevent hip fractures in elderly patients with Parkinson&#x 2019;s disease. PubMed was used to search the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Parkinson&#x 2019;s disease and hip fractures. The inclusion criteria were 50 or more subjects per group and a study period of 1 year or longer. Five RCTs were identified and the relative risk and 95 % confidence interval were calculated for individual RCTs. Sunlight exposure increased serum hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentration, improved motor function, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Alendronate or risedronate with vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25 (OH) D concentration, strongly decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. <b>Menatetrenone</b> (vitamin K 2) decreased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentration, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Sunlight exposure (men and women), <b>menatetrenone</b> (women), alendronate and risedronate with vitamin D supplementation (women) significantly reduced the incidence of hip fractures. The respective RRs (95 % confidence intervals) according to the intention-to-treat analysis were 0. 27 (0. 08, 0. 96), 0. 13 (0. 02, 0. 97), 0. 29 (0. 10, 0. 85) and 0. 20 (0. 06, 0. 68).

40|$|ObjectiveWhile hepatic {{resection}} {{or local}} ablative therapy {{may provide a}} potentially curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), {{more than half of}} these patients develop recurrent HCC within 5 years after treatment. Thus identification of any therapy which can decrease or delay the incidence of recurrence will improve the results of treatment. However, no chemopreventive agent has been approved for HCC. MethodsA MEDLINE database, Embase, Cancerlit (National Cancer Institute), and CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database) search from 1990 to 2009 was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords “hepatocellular carcinoma,” “vitamin analogue,” and “chemoprevention. ” Additional papers were identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. The fixed effect model was used for a meta-analysis. ResultsOral administration of acyclic retinoids (vitamin A analogue), and <b>menatetrenone</b> (vitamin K 2 analogue) have been tested as chemopreventive agents after hepatic resection or local ablative therapy for HCC. There were one and four randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated the efficacy of polyprenoic acid and <b>menatetrenone,</b> respectively. All studies were conducted in Japan. One RCT showed the preventive effect of polyprenoic acid in lowering the incidence of HCC recurrence after hepatic resection or percutaneous ethanol injection, and this effect lasted up to 199 weeks after randomization (or 151 weeks after completion of retinoid administration). Four RCTs evaluated the preventive efficacy of <b>menatetrenone</b> on HCC recurrence after hepatic resection or local ablative therapy. The results of three studies, as well as the meta-analysis of all four studies, showed significantly better tumour recurrencefree survival. The beneficial effect on the overall survival was less definite. ConclusionThere is evidence to suggest that chemopreventive therapy after partial hepatectomy or local ablative therapy is beneficial in prolonging disease-free survival, but the evidence is less for an effect on the overall survival. To confirm the beneficial role of vitamin A or K analogues in the chemoprevention of HCC further and larger randomised trials are now required...|$|E
40|$|Low vitamin K {{status is}} {{associated}} with low BMD and increased fracture risk. Additionally, a specific menaquinone, <b>menatetrenone</b> (MK 4), may reduce fracture risk. However, whether vitamin K {{plays a role in}} the skeletal health of North American women remains unclear. Moreover, various K vitamers (e. g., phylloquinone and MK 4) may have differing skeletal effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of phylloquinone or MK 4 treatment on markers of skeletal turnover and BMD in nonosteoporotic, postmenopausal, North American women. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 381 postmenopausal women received phylloquinone (1 mg daily), MK 4 (45 mg daily), or placebo for 12 mo. All participants received daily calcium and vitamin D 3 supplementation. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP) and n-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX) were measured at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo. Lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD and proximal femur geometry were measured by DXA at baseline and 6 and 12 mo. At baseline, the three treatment groups did not differ in demographics or study endpoints. Compliance with calcium, phylloquinone, and MK 4 treatment was 93 %, 93 %, and 87 %, respectively. Phylloquinone and MK 4 treatment reduced serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin but did not alter BSALP or NTX. No effect of phylloquinone or MK 4 on lumbar spine or proximal femur BMD or proximal femur geometric parameters was observed. This study does not support a role for vitamin K supplementation in osteoporosis prevention among healthy, postmenopausal, North American women receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation...|$|E

Methods: Twenty-one 6 -week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a unilateral osteotomy of the femoral diaphysis followed by intramedullary wire fixation; the rats were then divided into three groups: the vehicle administration group (control, n = 8), the vitamin K 2 administration (<b>menatetrenone</b> 30 mg/kg orally, five times a week) group (positive control, n = 5), and the celecoxib administration (4 mg/kg orally, five times a week) group (n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, the wires were removed, and a bone histomorphometric analysis was performed on the bone tissue inside the callus. The lamellar area relative to the bone area was significantly higher and the total area and woven area relative to the bone area were significantly lower in the vitamin K 2 group than in the vehicle group. However, none of the structural parameters, such as the callus and bone area relative to the total area, lamellar and woven areas relative to the bone area, or the formative and resorptive parameters such as osteoclast surface, number of osteoclasts, osteoblast surface, osteoid surface, eroded surface, and bone formation rate per bone surface differed significantly between the vehicle and celecoxib groups.

40|$|Copyright © 2009 by the American Physiological Society. The vitamin K {{family members}} {{phylloquinone}} (vitamin K 1) and the menaquinones (vitamin K 2) are under study for {{their roles in}} bone metabolism and as potential therapeutic agents for skeletal diseases. We have investigated the effects of two naturally occurring homologs, phytonadione (vitamin K 1) and <b>menatetrenone</b> (vitamin K 2), {{and those of the}} synthetic vitamin K, menadione (vitamin K 3), on human primary osteoblasts. All homologs promoted in vitro mineralization by these cells. Vitamin K 1 -induced mineralization was highly sensitive to warfarin, whereas that induced by vitamins K 2 and K 3 was less sensitive, implying that -carboxylation and other mechanisms, possibly genomic actions through activation of the steroid xenobiotic receptor, are involved in the effect. The positive effect on mineralization was associated with decreased matrix synthesis, evidenced by a decrease from control in expression of type I collagen mRNA, implying a maturational effect. Incubation in the presence of vitamin K 2 or K 3 in a three-dimensional type I collagen gel culture system resulted in increased numbers of cells with elongated cytoplasmic processes resembling osteocytes. This effect was not warfarin sensitive. Addition of calcein to vitamin K-treated cells revealed vitamin K-dependent deposition of mineral associated with cell processes. These effects are consistent with vitamin K promoting the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition in humans. To test whether vitamin K may also act on mature osteocytes, we tested the effects of vitamin K on MLO-Y 4 cells. Vitamin K reduced receptor activator of NF-B ligand expression relative to osteoprotegerin by MLO-Y 4 cells, an effect also seen in human cultures. Together, our findings suggest that vitamin K promotes the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition, at the same time decreasing the osteoclastogenic potential of these cells. These may be mechanisms by which vitamin K optimizes bone formation and integrity in vivo and may help explain the net positive effect of vitamin K on bone formationGerald J. Atkins, Katie J.

40|$|Teriparatide (PTH 1 - 34) {{promotes}} skeletal {{repair and}} increases bone mass. Vitamin K {{is involved in}} bone mineralization as a coenzyme of gamma-carboxylase for Gla proteins, and therefore vitamin K insufficiency caused by malnutrition or therapeutic intake of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin could affect the efficacy of PTH 1 - 34 therapy for bone repair. In the present study, we investigated whether vitamin K influences the efficacy of PTH 1 - 34 therapy for bone repair in a rat osteotomy model. Female 12 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a closed midshaft osteotomy of the femur and randomized into four groups (n = 10 per group) : vehicle, PTH 1 - 34 (daily 30 mu g/kg/day subcutaneous injection) + solvent (orally, three times a week), PTh 1 - 34 + warfarin (0. 4 mg/kg/day orally, three times a week), and PTH 1 - 34 + vitamin K- 2 (<b>menatetrenone,</b> 30 mg/kg/day orally, three times a week). Serum gamma-carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC and Glu-OC) levels and radiographic healing were monitored every 2 weeks. Skeletal repair was assessed by micro-computed tomography, mechanical testing, and histology at 8 weeks after surgery. PTH 1 - 34 amplified the osteotomy-induced increase in Gla-OC and improved the mechanical properties {{as well as the}} volumetric bone mineral tissue density of the fracture callus. Concurrent use of warfarin decreased the response to PTH 1 - 34 therapy in terms of mechanical recovery, probably by impairing mineralization {{due to the lack of}} Gla-OC. Although the effects of combination therapy with PTH 1 - 34 and vitamin K- 2 on bone repair did not significantly exceed those of PTH 1 - 34 monotherapy in rats fed sufficient dietary vitamin K, postoperative Gla-OC levels were correlated with the mechanical properties of the osteotomized femur in PTH 1 - 34 -treated rats regardless of the use of warfarin or vitamin K- 2. These findings suggest the importance of vitamin K dependent gamma-carboxylation of DC for realizing the full effects of PTH 1 - 34 on skeletal repair. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
