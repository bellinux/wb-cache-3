This step is called projection, {{even though it}} transforms a volume into another volume, since the resulting Z coordinates are not stored in the image, but are only used in Z-buffering in the later rastering step. In a perspective illustration, a central projection is used. To {{limit the number of}} displayed objects, two additional clipping planes are used; The visual volume is therefore a truncated pyramid (frustum). The parallel or orthogonal projection is used, for example, for technical representations because it has the advantage that all parallels in the object space are also parallel in the image space, and the surfaces and volumes are the same size regardless of the distance from the viewer. Maps use, for example, an orthogonal projection (so-called orthophoto), but oblique images of a landscape cannot be used in this way - although they can technically be rendered, they seem so distorted that we cannot make any use of them.The formula for calculating a perspective <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> is: ...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple set of {{hypotheses}} governing the deviations of the leptonic <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> from the Harrison-Perkins-Scott (HPS) form. These deviations {{are supposed to}} arise entirely from a perturbation of the mass matrix in the charged lepton sector. The perturbing matrix {{is assumed to be}} purely imaginary (thus maximally T-violating) and to have a strength in energy scale no greater (but perhaps smaller) than the muon mass. As we shall show, it then follows that the absolute value of the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> elements pertaining to the tau lepton deviate by no more than O((m_μ/m_τ) ^ 2) ≃ 3. 5 × 10 ^- 3 from their HPS values. Assuming that (m_μ/m_τ) ^ 2 can be neglected, we derive two simple constraints on the four parameters θ_ 12, θ_ 23, θ_ 31, and δ of the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix.</b> These constraints are independent of the details of the imaginary T-violating perturbation of the charged lepton mass matrix. We also show that the e and μ parts of the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> have a definite form governed by two parameters α and β; any deviation of order m_μ/m_τ can be accommodated by adjusting these two parameters.

40|$|The mapping {{method is}} an {{efficient}} tool to investigate distributive mixing induced by periodic flows. Computed only once, the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> {{can be applied}} {{a number of times}} to determine the distribution of concentration inside the flow domain. Spectral analysis of the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix</b> reveals detailed properties of the distributive mixing as all relevant information is stored in its eigenmodes. Any vector that describes a distribution of concentration can be expanded in the complete system of linearly independent eigenvectors of the <b>mapping</b> <b>matrix.</b> The rapid decay of the contribution of each mode in the eigenmode decomposition allows for a truncation of the eigenmode expansion from the whole spectrum to only the dominant eigenmodes (characterized by a decay rate significantly lower than the duration of the mixing process). This truncated decomposition adequately represents the distribution of concentration inside the flow domain already after a low number of periods, because contributions of all non-dominant eigenmodes rapidly become insignificant. The truncation is determined independently of the initial distribution of concentration and based on the decay rates of the eigenmodes, which are inversely proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues. Only modes with eigenvalues above a certain threshold are retained. The key advantage of the proposed compact eigenmode representation of the mapping method is that it includes practically relevant transient states and not just the asymptotic one. As such the method enables an eigenmode analysis of realistic problems yet with a substantial reduction in computational effort compared to the conventional approach...|$|E

Detailed analysis of radiated emissions from an IC leads to dipole representations of the sources.

The magnitude of these disturbances is taken as a metric of electromagnetic emissions potential. The power spectral density and the radiation efficiency of the ICs are investigated.

Green's functions are derived that relate the dipole sources to the electromagnetic disturbances induced on the walls of the enclosure. <b>Mapping</b> <b>matrices</b> are proposed that relate multiple sources to multiple points on the wall.
