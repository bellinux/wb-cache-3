50|$|The parcel mule scam, {{also known}} as the reshipping scam, {{involves}} scammers and unsuspecting victims handling goods to other countries. In some ways it is similar to the <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> scam. Scammers use fake advertising to hire mules. Items are bought with stolen cards, and since the goods are typically re-sold once shipped, this scam can be viewed as an indirect form of money laundering.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, The FBI Cyber Crimes Task Force, {{composed}} of Federal, State, and Local law enforcement, charged more than 37 defendants {{involved in a}} highly organized <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> scheme, facilitated by the Zeus Financial Trojan. This group of money mules opened several bank accounts, using both real and fake identification, to receive stolen funds from compromised bank accounts, withdraw the stolen money, then wire the stolen funds overseas. These money mules facilitated the theft of over $3 million from victim bank accounts.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> used by cyber {{criminal}}s. Although <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> {{are not part of}} the core group of criminal networks, they play an important role within these networks. They are used to interrupt the trail to criminal networks. However, to date only a few cyber crime studies have focused on <b>money</b> <b>mules.</b> Based on case studies about cyber criminal groups, we expected differences between <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> used by low-tech as opposed to high-tech groups. We analyzed data from a fraud registration database of a Dutch bank to gain in-sight into the characteristics of <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> and how cyber criminal networks use them. Our analyses clearly show that there are indeed significant differences. Furthermore, the characteristics of <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> indicate what kind of criminal network is behind the attack. The results of our study can be used by law enforcement agencies to develop targeted investigation and prosecution strategies...|$|R
50|$|The hackers {{then used}} this {{information}} {{to take over the}} victims’ bank accounts and make unauthorized transfers of thousands of dollars at a time, often routing the funds to other accounts controlled by a network of <b>money</b> <b>mules,</b> paid a commission. Many of the U.S. <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> were recruited from overseas. They created bank accounts using fake documents and false names. Once the money was in the accounts, the mules would either wire it back to their bosses in Eastern Europe, or withdraw it in cash and smuggle it out of the country.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Money</b> <b>mules</b> are complicit {{and risk}} {{criminal}} prosecution and long jail sentences. Commonly, they are recruited with job advertisements for [...] "payment processing agents", [...] "money transfer agents", [...] "local processors", {{and other similar}} titles; the real benefit to the criminals is not the work {{carried out by the}} mule, but that the criminals are distanced from the risky, visible transfer. Some <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> are recruited by an attractive member of the opposite sex. Candidates are asked to accept funds and to forward them, after deducting a relatively small payment for themselves, to a third party, which they can do from home. Legitimate companies use escrow services for this kind of work. Criminals trading in stolen or illegally acquired goods use similar tactics to recruit mules who receive packages and forward them to mail drops not traceable to the criminal.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>money</b> <b>mule,</b> {{sometimes}} called a [...] "smurfer," [...] {{is a person}} who transfers money acquired illegally (e.g., stolen) in person, through a courier service, or electronically, on behalf of others. Typically, the mule is paid for services with {{a small part of the}} money transferred. Money mules are often dupes recruited on-line for what they think is legitimate employment, not aware that the money they are transferring is the product of crime. The money is transferred from the mule's account to the scam operator, typically in another country. Similar techniques are used to transfer illegal merchandise.|$|E
50|$|Zombie {{computers}} {{have been used}} extensively to send e-mail spam; as of 2005, an estimated 50 - 80% of all spam worldwide was sent by zombie computers. This allows spammers to avoid detection and presumably reduces their bandwidth costs, since the owners of zombies pay for their own bandwidth. This spam also greatly furthers the spread of Trojan horses, as Trojans are not self-replicating. They rely on the movement of e-mails or spam to grow, whereas worms can spread by other means. For similar reasons zombies are also used to commit click fraud against sites displaying pay-per-click advertising. Others can host phishing or <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> recruiting websites.|$|E
5000|$|Kristina Vladimirovna Svechinskaya (Кристина Владимировна Свечинская, born February 16, 1989) is {{a former}} Russian <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> hacker. A student of the New York University, in 2010 she was accused of a plot to defraud several British and U.S. banks of {{sizeable}} sums and usage of false passports. According to charges, Svechinskaya used Zeus trojan horse to attack thousands of bank accounts and opened at least five accounts in Bank of America and Wachovia, which received $35,000 (£22,000) of money theft. It is estimated that with nine other people Svechinskaya had skimmed $3 million in total. Svechinskaya was dubbed by the media [...] "the world's sexiest computer hacker" [...] for her raunchy, but casual appearance and was compared to Anna Chapman. The upcoming Russian film Botnet is partially based on Svechinskaya's story.|$|E
50|$|The criminals {{were able}} to {{manipulate}} their access to the respective banking networks in order to steal the money {{in a variety of}} ways. In some instances, ATMs were instructed to dispense cash without having to locally interact with the terminal. <b>Money</b> <b>mules</b> would collect the money and transfer it over the SWIFT network to the criminals’ accounts, Kaspersky said. The Carbanak group {{went so far as to}} alter databases and pump up balances on existing accounts and pocketing the difference unbeknownst to the user whose original balance is still intact.|$|R
40|$|Phishing, {{a form of}} on-line {{identity}} theft, is a {{major problem}} worldwide, accounting for more than $ 7. 5 Billion in losses in the US alone between 2005 and 2008. Australia was the first country to be targeted by Internet bank phishing in 2003 and continues to have a significant problem in this area. The major cyber crime groups responsible for phishing are based in Eastern Europe. They operate with a large degree of freedom due to the inherent difficulties in cross border law enforcement and the current situation in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and the Ukraine. They employ highly sophisticated and efficient technical tools to compromise victims and subvert bank authentication systems. However because it is difficult for them to repatriate the fraudulently obtained funds directly they employ Internet <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> in Australia to transfer the money via Western Union or Money gram. It is proposed a strategy, which firstly places more focus by Australian law enforcement upon transactions via Western Union and Money gram to detect this money laundering, would significantly impact the success of the Phishing attack model. This combined with a technical monitoring of Trojan technology and education of potential Internet <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> to avoid being duped would provide a winning strategy for the war on phishing for Australia. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Social {{engineering}} scams: It {{refers to}} a non-technical kind of intrusion, {{in the form of}} e-mails or social networking chats, that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves fooling potential victims into downloading malware or leaking personal data. Social engineering is nevertheless highly effective for attacking well-protected computer systems with the exploitation of trust. Social networking becomes an increasingly important tool for cyber criminals to recruit <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> to assist their money laundering operations around the globe. Spammers are not only spoofing social networking messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails — they are taking advantage of users’ trust of their social networking connections to attract new victims.|$|R
5000|$|Fluent in English, Svechinskaya was {{originally}} studying at the Stavropol State University. According to Svechinskaya's mother, {{after the death}} of Kristina's father their family was living on a sole 12,000 ruble ($400 USD at the time) salary. While in her third year, Kristina chose the Work & Travel program and in the summer of 2010 arrived in Massachusetts, where she started to work in a fast-food branch. The earnings in Massachusetts however were small and she moved to New York where she chose to work as a hacker's <b>money</b> <b>mule.</b> Svechinskaya was offered an 8-10% share of taken money. The sentence was expected to be announced in June 2011, but after the arrest Svechinskaya signed a personal recognizance bond and was released under $25,000 bail. [...] In case of conviction, Svechinskaya could have been imprisoned for up to 40 years. This would have included the plot charge (30 years and the $1 million fine) and the false passports charge (10 years and the $250,000 fine).|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of November 2014, it was known that by accessing Booking.com reservations, criminals were able to obtain customer details through demands for prepayment. Booking.com said it was countering the fraudsters and refunding customers from the UK, US, France, Italy, the UAE and Portugal, all {{of which had been}} affected. Since the fraud, Booking.com has made changes so data can only be accessed from a computer linked to the hotel's server. Its teams have also worked to [...] "take down" [...] dozens of phishing sites, as well as working with some banks to freeze the <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> bank accounts.In February 2015, an open letter published by German hotelier Marco Nussbaum, Co-founder and CEO of the budget-design hotelbrand [...] "prizeotel", the brand hijacking of Booking.com met strong criticism. His letter outlined details relating to the Google Adwords policy of Booking.com was doing damage to his business. The letter was discussed in specialist media and led to a debate concerning current difficulties and challenges for online distribution within the hotel industry.|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} massive growth in Internet {{commerce}} {{over the last}} ten years there has been a corresponding boom in Internet related crime, or cybercrime. According to research recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2006 57, 000 Australians aged 15 years and over fell victim to phishing and related Internet scams. Of all the victims of cybercrime, only one group is potentially subject to criminal prosecution: `Internet money mules'-those who, either knowingly or unknowingly, launder money. This paper examines the demographic profile-specifically age, gender and postcode-related to 660 confirmed <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> incidents recorded during the calendar year 2007, for a major Australian financial institution. This data is compared to ABS statistics of Internet usage in 2006. There is clear evidence of a strong gender bias towards males, particularly in the older age group. This is directly relevant when considering education and training programs for both corporations and the community on the issues surrounding Internet <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> scams and in ultimately understanding the problem of Internet banking fraud. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Web-based {{criminality}} like counterfeiting uses web applications {{which are}} hosted on web servers. Those servers contain {{a lot of}} information which can be used to identify the owner and other connected persons like hosters, shipping partners, <b>money</b> <b>mules</b> and more. These pieces of information reveal insights on the owner or provider of a fraud website, thus we can call them traces. These traces can then be used by the police, law enforcement authorities or the legal representatives of the victim. In our project 2 we had identified a vast range of possible traces. We had also considered their information content and existing limitations. During our Bachelor thesis, we have selected several traces and started the implementation of the API with its underlying library. After the successful implementation of the selected traces, we have created a graphical user interface to allow the use of our solution without using a command-line interface. To do so, we have learned to use the Scala Programming Language and its integration with Java code. The graphical user interface of our example application is built using Scala Swing, the Scala adoption of the Swing Framework. The test cases are defined using ScalaTest with FlatSpec and Matchers and executed using the JUnit Runner...|$|R
40|$|A {{crucial part}} of a cyber-criminal’s job is to balance the risks and rewards of his every action. For example, an expert spammer will tune a bot’s email-sending rate to achieve a good {{throughput}} with an acceptable risk of being detected. Then, such a cyber-criminal has to choose how to launder the money he made with spamming, and {{he will have to}} consider many options (<b>money</b> <b>mules,</b> Bitcoin, etc.) that will offer different returns and risks. Although understanding these trade-offs and coming {{as close as possible to}} their optimum is what discriminates winners and losers in the cyber-crime world, there has been little study on this matter, as setting up a large-scale study to study how cyber-criminals deal with these risk-reward trade-offs is challenging. Computer security competitions provide a great opportu-nity both to educate students and to study realistic cyber-security scenarios in a controlled environment. Looking to study the risk-reward trade-offs seen in real cyber-security in-cidents, we designed and hosted a novel format for a Capture the Flag cyber-security contest, involving 89 teams compris-ing over 1, 000 students across the globe. In this paper, we describe the intuition, intent, and design of the contest. Ad-ditionally, we present an analysis of the data set collected, evaluate its effectiveness in modeling risk-reward behavior, examine the strategies of the competing teams, and estimate the effectiveness of such strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|Fraud {{with online}} payment {{services}} {{is an ongoing}} problem, with significant financial-economic and societal impact. One of the main modus operandi is financial malware that compromises consumer and corporate devices, thereby potentially undermining the security of critical financial systems. Recent research into the underground economy has shown that cybercriminals are organised around highly specialised tasks, such as pay-per-install markets for infected machines, malware-as-a-service and <b>money</b> <b>mule</b> recruitment. Setting up a successful financial malware scheme requires the aligning of many moving parts. Analysing how cybercrime groups acquire, combine and align these parts into value chains can greatly benefit from existing insights into the economics of online crime. Using transaction cost economics, this paper illustrates the business model behind financial malware and presents three novel value chains therein. For this purpose, we use a conceptual synthesis of the state-of-the-art {{of the literature on}} financial malware, underground markets and (cyber) crime economics, as well as today’s banking practice. </p...|$|E
