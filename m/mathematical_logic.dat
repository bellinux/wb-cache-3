Constraints on these variables are expressed by <b>Mathematical</b> <b>Logics.</b> Hybrid Systems {{are used for}} modeling embedded systems and time dependent processes. In these branches of study safety and security are among the main requirements that a system must satisfy, hence the interest of ways to express and prove these properties. The aim of the thesis is to extend the classical classes of Hybrid Systems and to study safety and security properties of real life systems. For this purpose, we consider di#erent subclasses of High Order <b>Mathematical</b> <b>Logics</b> over real variables, integers variables, arrays with infinite elements and parameters. We recall four classes which are enclosed in First Order <b>Mathematical</b> <b>Logics</b> and for which the satisfiability problem of a formula {{is known to be}} decidable.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} performing semantic searches for analyzing military intelligence. Our strategy allows the analyst and the query engine {{to work together to}} reduce a complex query into simpler queries. The answers for the simpler queries are combined into answers for the original query. The queries can be refined using rules defined by the analyst or analytics created by a data scientist. Our strategy uses an alternative approach to semantic modeling than the state-of-theart approaches based on OWL. OWL is an implementation of a branch of <b>mathematical</b> <b>logics</b> designed specifically for semantic modeling called description logics. Our strategy uses a branch of <b>mathematical</b> <b>logics</b> called type theory. We use type theory because of the long history of developing systems based on type theory for reasoning interactively. We demonstrate with an example how the strategy can be used to answer questions posed by analysts that couldn't be answered using conventional methods...|$|R

5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, {{limits to what}} <b>mathematical</b> <b>logic</b> could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of <b>mathematical</b> <b>logic</b> was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{discuss a}} formal many-valued logic called EQlogic {{which is based}} on a {{recently}} introduced special class of algebras called EQ-algebras. The latter have three basic binary operations (meet, multiplication, fuzzy equality) and a top element and, in a certain sense, generalize residuated lattices. The goal of EQ-logics is to present a possible direction in the development of <b>mathematical</b> <b>logics</b> in which axioms are formed as identities. In this paper we propose a basic EQ-logic and three extensions which end up with a logic equivalent to the MTL-logic.

40|$|Following the {{development}} of the selectionist theory of the immune system, there was an attempt to characterize many biological mechanisms as being "selectionist" as juxtaposed to "instructionist. " But this broad definition would group Darwinian evolution, the immune system, embryonic development, and Chomsky's language-acquisition mechanism as all being "selectionist. " Yet Chomsky's mechanism (and embryonic development) are significantly different from the selectionist mechanisms of biological evolution or the immune system. Surprisingly, there is a very abstract way using two dual <b>mathematical</b> <b>logics</b> to make the distinction between genuinely selectionist mechanisms and what are better called "generative" mechanisms.

30|$|As it is known, {{often the}} {{modeling}} of natural phenomena states using mathematical tools (<b>mathematical</b> arithmetic, <b>mathematical</b> <b>logics</b> and etc.). However, obtaining a deterministic model of such problems {{is not easy}} and always has some error and vagueness. So, investigating a popular way to interpret such vagueness is important. Since 1965 with Zadeh’s well-known paper on introducing fuzzy sets [12], the applications of a fuzzy concept have appeared more visibly instead of deterministic-stochastic cases. As a result, we need some extensions of mathematical models (e.g., in this contribution, we investigate fractional differential equation) to fuzzy field such that these extensions have natural relationship between crisp and fuzzy cases and even have a natural relation between fuzzy fractional and fuzzy non-fractional cases.|$|R
