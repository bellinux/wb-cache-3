The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, Beverly Hills, 90210, and <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place.</b>|$|E
5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place,</b> The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melrose</b> <b>Place</b> was {{initially}} inspired by Star's own professional aspirations during his 20s, while Models Inc. was born when FOX asked Spelling for an eight-part summer series. When ratings proved adequate, the show continued throughout the following television season.

During the final episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 season 2, Grant Show played his <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place</b> {{character}} Jake, who started a relationship with Kelly which led into early episodes of the spin-off. During Kelly's appearances, her relationship with Jake was largely on-and-off due to his discomfort with her youth. In the end, after weeks of trying to break up with Kelly, Jake pretended to cheat on her, prompting her to leave him. Afterward on both Beverly Hills, 90210 and <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place,</b> Kelly, Donna, Jake, and others made occasional comments concerning Kelly and Jake's brief relationship.|$|E
25|$|Several {{actors have}} gone on to {{additional}} fame following their work in the franchise.

5000|$|James Young Simpson, who {{had written}} several {{articles}} on archaeology, observed that there were contradictory accounts concerning the location of Constantine's death. While most accounts place the battle near the River Almond, there were two rivers of that name in Scotland, one in Perthshire and one in Lothian. George Chalmers identified the one in Perthsire {{to have been the}} intended location. But John of Fordun, the Scotichronicon, Hector Boece, and George Buchanan all point to the one in Lothian. The Chronicle of <b>Melrose</b> <b>places</b> the battle near the River Avon. Andrew of Wyntoun places it near the river [...] "Awyne". John Lesley places it near the River Annan, and considers it part of an ongoing invasion of Cumbria.|$|R
50|$|Season four saw two new regular characters: Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), the {{ruthless}} hospital Chief of Staff introduced in season three; and Brooke Armstrong (Kristin Davis), a young, conniving intern at D&D Advertising also recurring the previous season. Davis's character was subsequently killed {{off in the}} middle of the fourth season, while Zuniga left the series at the end of the season. Patrick Muldoon also arrived in the third season as the villainous Richard Hart. Although Muldoon was not billed with the main cast (though he appeared in numerous promotional photos with them), he appeared in most of the fourth season's episodes and is also <b>Melrose</b> <b>Places</b> longest recurring character (i.e. not in the opening credits) in terms of number of episodes.|$|R

5000|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{gave the}} series a mixed review, stating [...] "It may lack <b>Melrose</b> <b>Places</b> flashy {{production}} values and trashy pedigree, {{but it makes}} up for that by being marginally better written, though admittedly, were {{not talking about a}} particularly high bar here." [...] Bianco went on to criticize the acting of the cast, calling them [...] "unimpressive", stating [...] "whats dispiriting about Beautiful Life is that its too lazy to even work as successful eye candy." [...] Bianco also criticized Mischa Barton, calling her [...] "inept" [...] in her role, stating that [...] "she was stilted at best on The O.C., and instead of improving as an actress, shes merely solidified bad habits." [...] Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe called the pilot [...] "half-baked" [...] further stating, [...] "Whether thats due to Barton or deeper creative problems is unclear." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the show [...] "unwatchable", noting the its [...] "pointless gloss and heinous writing." [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that only 12-year-olds could believe the show, calling the actors [...] "unbelieveable" [...] , commenting [...] "they cant even get the runway stomp right." [...] Stasi also negatively commented on the dialogue of the show. Calling the plot [...] "laughable" [...] and the acting [...] "mediocre", Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer said the show featured the [...] "usual cynical CW glorification of teen sexuality and substance abuse." ...|$|R
5000|$|The inaugural <b>Melrose</b> Sports took <b>place</b> on 28 April 1883, and {{included}} foot races, drop-kicks, dribbling races and place kicking {{as well as}} the main attraction of the rugby tournament, which attracted eight teams. Haig played on the Melrose team, which would go on to defeat local rivals Gala in the final, receiving a cup donated by the ladies of Melrose (now known as The Ladies Cup). The immediate success of the tournament meant that other clubs in the Borders region also set up their own Rugby Sevens competitions. [...] After Haig retired from competition, he continued to take an active part in the running of the club, serving for several seasons on the General and Match committee. He died in Melrose on 28 March 1939.|$|R
6000|$|... {{which is}} but {{about three miles}} distant. The country between <b>Melrose</b> and that <b>place</b> {{is not in the}} least beautiful, nor very noteworthy,--one or two old {{irregular}} villages; one tower that looks principally domestic, yet partly warlike, and seems to be of some antiquity; and an undulation, or rounded hilly surface of the landscape, sometimes affording wide vistas between the slopes. These hills, which, I suppose, are some of them on the Abbotsford estate, are partly covered with woods, but of Scotch fir, or some tree of that species, which creates no softened undulation, but overspreads the hill like a tightly fitting wig. It is a cold, dreary, disheartening neighborhood, that of Abbotsford; at least, it has appeared so to me at both of my visits,--one of which was on a bleak and windy May morning, and this one on a chill, showery morning of midsummer.|$|R
25|$|After college, she pursued acting {{full-time}} in Los Angeles.

25|$|Rob Estes was {{the last}} actor to join the series; he was sought by The CW to play the part of Harry Wilson, and would only appear {{in the first two}} seasons. Estes was a {{previous}} cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place.</b>|$|E
25|$|Charles Pratt, Jr. and Frank South {{worked closely}} with Darren Star in writing early seasons of <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place,</b> helping to set {{the tone of the}} series as it grew in popularity.

5000|$|In 875, the Chronicle and the Annals of Ulster again {{report a}} Viking army in Pictland. A battle, fought near Dollar, {{was a heavy}} defeat for the Picts; the Annals of Ulster say that [...] "a great {{slaughter}} of the Picts resulted". In 877, shortly after building a new church for the Culdees at St Andrews, Causantín was captured and executed (or perhaps killed in battle) after defending against Viking raiders. Although there is agreement on the time and general manner of his death, {{it is not clear}} where this happened. Some believe he was beheaded on a Fife beach, following a battle at Fife Ness, near Crail. William Forbes Skene reads the Chronicle as placing Causantín's death at Inverdovat (by Newport-on-Tay), which appears to match the Prophecy of Berchán. The account in the Chronicle of <b>Melrose</b> names the <b>place</b> as the [...] "Black Cave," [...] and John of Fordun calls it the [...] "Black Den". Causantín was buried on Iona.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} contradictions {{concerning}} {{the location of}} the battle in relation to the river. The Scotichronicon, <b>Melrose,</b> and Wyntoun <b>placed</b> the battle at the river source. Melrose also adding the word [...] "Tegalere" [...] to describe the location. Which might be the same as the [...] "Inregale regens" [...] of the Scotichronicon and the [...] "Indegale" [...] of the Liber Dumblain. Boece and Buchanan place the battle at a river mouth, where the Almond enters the Firth of Forth. That is where Cramond is located, called [...] "Crawmond" [...] in some editions of Boece. The [...] "Nomina Regum Scottorum et Pictorum", discovered by Robert Sibbald at the St Andrews Cathedral Priory, place the death sites of both Domnall mac Ailpín and Constantine III at Rathveramoen (Rathinveramon). Which etymologically derives from [...] "Rath Inver Amoen", the ráth {{at the mouth of the}} Amoen/Amon (the Almond). That is the fortress Bertha in Perth, located at the mouth of the Almond. A location where the Almond joins the River Tay, and in proximity to Scone. Rathinveramon also lay at short distance from Perth. Monzievaird, where Kenneth III was eventually killed, was about 15 miles from Perth. Forteviot, connected to Kenneth MacAlpin and his death, is also located in Perthshire.|$|R

25|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a fairly straight-faced drama about the personal and professional lives of people in their twenties and early thirties, <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place</b> began to change {{with the arrival of}} testy Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear), whose conflicts with the generally strait-laced Alison (Courtney Thorne-Smith) over Alison's roommate Billy (Andrew Shue) quickly became the show's centerpiece. Also focused upon was the adulterous relationship between Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro) and his colleague Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross), which was eventually discovered by Michael's wife Jane (Josie Bissett). The first season also introduced Jane's sister Sydney (Laura Leighton), an occasional vixen, who would {{become one of the most}} layered and prominent characters of the series.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, artists Eric Stanton, Robert Blue and Olivia De Berardinis {{were among}} the first to start {{painting}} Bettie images. In 1979, artist Robert Blue had a show titled Steps Into Space, at a gallery on <b>Melrose</b> <b>Place</b> in Los Angeles, where he showed his collection of Bettie Page paintings. At that time in New York, artist Olivia De Berardinis had begun painting Bettie for Italian jean manufacturer Fiorucci. Olivia has continued to paint Bettie, and compiled a collection of this artwork in a book titled Bettie Page by Olivia (2006), with a foreword by Hugh Hefner.
