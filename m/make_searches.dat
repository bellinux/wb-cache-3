5000|$|An OPath {{query string}} allows {{to express the}} {{parameters}} that will be queried for to be specified using Item properties, embedded Items as well as Relationships. It can specify a single search condition, such as [...] "title = Something'", or a compound condition such as [...] "title = 'Title 1' || title = 'Title 2' && author = 'Someone'". These boolean and relational operations can be specified using C# like &&, ||, =, != operators {{as well as their}} English-like equivalent like EQUAL, NOT EQUAL. SQL like operators such as LIKE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY are also supported, as are wildcard conditions. So, [...] "title LIKE 'any*'" [...] is a valid query string. These operators can be used to execute complex searches such as [...] using (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open (...) [...] ) { //Searching begins by creating a ItemSearcher object. The searcher is created from a //relationship instance because the contacts being searched for are in relation. The //first parameter defines the scope of the search. An ItemContext as the scope means //the entire store is to be searched. Scope can be limited to a set of Items which may //be in a holding relationship with the contacts. In that case, the set is passed as //the scope of the search. ItemSearcher searcher = OutContactRelationship.GetTargetSearcher(ic, typeof(Contact)); ContactCollection contacts = searcher.FindAll("OutContactRelationship.Contact.Name LIKE 'A*'"); }The above code snippet creates an ItemSearcher object that searches on the OutContactRelationship instance that relates pictures and contacts, in effect searching all pictures related with a contact. It then runs the query Name LIKE 'A*'" [...] on all contacts reachable through OutContactRelationship, returning the list of [...] "contacts whose names start with A and whose pictures I have". Similarly, more relationships could be taken into account to further narrow down the results. Further, a natural language query processor, which parses query in natural language and creates a well-formed OPath query string to search via proper relationships, can allow users to <b>make</b> <b>searches</b> such as [...] "find the name of the wine I had with person X last month", provided financial management applications are using WinFS to store bills.|$|E
5000|$|When the English, {{after the}} {{so-called}} Opium War, imposed on China the Treaty of Nanking (1842), {{they did not}} at first ask for religious liberty, but {{the murder of the}} Lazarist John Gabriel Perboyre (11 September 1840) becoming known, they added an article stipulating that thenceforth a missionary taken in the interior of the country should not be tried by the Chinese authorities, but should be delivered to the nearest consul of his country. On 24 October 1844, French ambassador Théodore de Lagrené secured further concessions which inaugurated a new era. The Treaty of Whampoa, which was signed on that date at Whampoa, speaks only of liberty for the French to settle in certain territory in the open ports, but {{at the request of the}} ambassador, an imperial edict was sent to the mandarins and at least partially promulgated, praising the Christian religion and removing the prohibition for Chinese to practice it. However, the execution of the missionary Auguste Chapdelaine in 1856 and other facts showed the insufficiency of the guarantees accorded to Europeans; to obtain others, England and France had recourse to arms. The war (1858-1860, cfr. Second Opium War), which showed China its weakness, was ended by the treaties of T'ien-tsin (24-25 October 1860). They contained an article which stipulated freedom for the missionaries to preach and for the Chinese to embrace Christianity. This article was included in the treaties which other powers a little later concluded with China. To the treaty with France was also added a supplementary article, which reads as follows: [...] "An imperial edict conformable to the imperial edict of 20 February 1846 secured by M. de Lagrené, will inform the people of the whole empire that soldiers and civilians be permitted to propagate and practice the religion of the Lord of Heaven Catholic, to assemble for explanation of doctrine, to build churches wherein to celebrate their ceremonies. Those mandarins who henceforth <b>make</b> <b>searches</b> or arbitrary arrests must be punished. Furthermore, the temples of the Lord of Heaven, together with the schools, cemeteries, lands, buildings etc., which were confiscated formerly when the followers of the religion of the Lord of Heaven were persecuted, shall be either restored or compensated for. Restoration is to be made to the French ambassador residing at Peking, who will transfer the property to the Christians of the localities concerned. In all the provinces also the missionaries shall be permitted to rent or purchase lands and erect buildings at will". The general and exclusive right of protection granted to the French over all the Catholic missions in China could not be more explicitly recognized than it was by this agreement, which made the French ambassador the indispensable intermediary in the matter of all restitutions. And the representatives of France never ceased to make full use of this right in favor of the missionaries, whom from the middle of the nineteenth century a revival of Apostolic zeal drew from all countries to China. From them the passports necessary to penetrate into the interior of the country were regularly sought, and to them were addressed complaints and claims, which it was their duty to lay before the Chinese Government. The French ministers also secured, not without difficulty, the necessary additions to the Treaty of T'ien-tsin—such, for instance, as the Berthemy Convention (1865) with the Gerard addition (1895), regulating the important question of the purchase of lands and buildings in the interior.|$|E
