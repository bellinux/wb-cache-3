In this study, we used remotely sensed reflectances in the red and blue-green portions of the visible spectrum retrieved from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the International Space Station (ISS) Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) images to create a model to estimate CDOM absorption.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{characterize}} particulate matter (PM) and elemental carbon (EC) indoor and outdoor concentration levels in the Athens area and to examine the contribution of ambient air to the observed indoor levels. 24 -hr simultaneous indoor and outdoor PM 10 and PM 2. 5 measurements were conducted at a central (CR) and a suburban (SR) residence, and at {{an office in the}} commercial centre of Athens (CO), during cold and warm period of 2006. The absorption coefficient (α) was measured on the collected filters, as a surrogate for EC concentration levels. Ambient PM levels were very high at both central sites and significant at SR (mean 24 -hr PM 10 : 87. 4, 50. 3 and 87. 3 μg m- 3 and PM 2. 5 : 50. 7, 20. 2 and 42. 8 μg m- 3 at CR, SR and CO).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to examine whether the standard particulate backscattering IOP (Inherent Optical Properties) measurement method could be simplified. IOP measurements are essential for parameterising several forms of algorithms used to estimate water quality parameters from airborne and satellite images. Field measurements of the backscattering IOPs {{are more difficult to}} make than absorption measurements as correction of the raw Hydroscat- 6 backscattering sensor observations is required to allow for the systematic errors associated with the water and water quality parameter absorption. The standard approach involves making simultaneous measurement of the absorption and attenuation of the water with an absorption and attenuation meter (ac- 9) or making assumptions about the particulate backscattering probability. Recently, a number of papers have been published that use an alternative method to retrieve the particulate backscattering spectrum by using laboratory <b>measured</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> and in situ spectroradiometric observations. The alternative method inverts a model of reflectance iteratively using non-linear least squares fitting to solve for the particulate backscattering at 532 nm (b bp 0 (532)) and the particulate backscattering spectral slope (γ). In this paper, eleven observations made at Burdekin Falls Dam, Australia are used to compare the alternative reflectance method to the conventional corrected Hydroscat- 6 observations. Assessment of the alternative reflectance method showed that the result of the inversions were highly dependent on the starting conditions. To overcome this limitation, Particle Swarm Optimisation, a stochastic search technique which includes a random element in the search approach, was used. It was found that when compared to the conventionally corrected Hydroscat- 6 observations, the alternative reflectance method underestimated b bp 0 (532) by approximately 50 % and overestimated γ by approximately 40 %. Differences of this scale in specific backscattering spectra will have a pronounced effect on the parameterisation and subsequent performance of semi-analytical water quality parameter retrieval algorithms. This has implications for any water quality monitoring regimes that rely on semi-analytical algorithms...|$|R

40|$|The optical {{properties}} (light scattering and absorption) of soot particles depend on soot size and index of refraction, {{but also on}} the soot complex morphology and the internal mixing with other material at the single particle level. For example, freshly emitted (nascent) soot particles can interact with other materials in the atmosphere, materials that can condense on soot and coat it. This coating can affect the soot {{optical properties}} by refracting light, or by changing the soot aggregate structure. A common approach to studying the effect of coating on soot optical properties is to <b>measure</b> <b>absorption</b> and scattering <b>values</b> in ambient air and then measure them again after removing the coating using a thermodenuder. In this approach, it is assumed that: 1) Most of the coating material is removed; 2) charred organic coating does not add to the refractory carbon; 3) oxidation of soot is negligible; and 4) the pre-existing core soot structure is left unaltered despite potential oxidation of the core at elevated temperature. In this study, we investigate the validity of the last assumption, by studying the effect of thermodenuding on the structure of nascent soot. To this end, we analyze the morphological properties of laboratory generated nascent soot, before and after thermodenuding. Our investigation shows that there is only minor restructuring of nascent soot by thermodenuding...|$|R

40|$|Most QSARs for dermal {{absorption}} predict the permeability coefficient, K p, of a molecule, which is valid for infinite dose conditions. In practice, dermal exposure mostly occurs under finite dose conditions. Therefore, a simple model to predict finite dose {{dermal absorption}} from infinite dose data (K p and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (K SC,W) was developed. To test the model, {{a series of}} in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using acetic acid, benzoic acid, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, butoxyethanol, cortisone, decanol, diazinone, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, ethacrynic acid, linolenic acid, octylparaben, oleic acid, propylparaben, salicylic acid and testosterone. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, <b>measured</b> <b>absorption</b> was overpredicted by the model, {{but most of the}} overpredictions were still below the European default <b>absorption</b> <b>value.</b> In conclusion, our finite dose prediction model provides a useful and cost-effective estimate of dermal absorption, to be used in risk assessment for non-volatile substances dissolved in water at non-irritating concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
