Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and a bad man. He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better than I do... He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> which." ...|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I'd <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E

Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about what I wanted to do, and since I had worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us."

2500|$|Some {{accounts}} {{say that}} Prince Henri had not forgotten her. According to these versions, he learned her address from the theater, arrived in Paris, {{and moved into}} the apartment with Bernhardt. After a month, he returned to Brussels and told his family {{that he wanted to}} marry the actress. The family of the Prince sent his uncle, General de Ligne, to break up the romance, threatening to disinherit him if he married Bernhardt. According to other accounts, the Prince denied any responsibility for the child. She later called the affair [...] "her abiding wound", but she never discussed Maurice's parentage with anyone. When asked who his father was, she sometimes answered, [...] "I could never <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> whether his father was Gambetta, Victor Hugo, or General Boulanger." [...] Many years later, in January 1885, when Bernhardt was famous, the Prince came to Paris and offered to formally recognize Maurice as his son, but Maurice politely declined, explaining he was entirely satisfied to be the son of Sarah Bernhardt.|$|E
