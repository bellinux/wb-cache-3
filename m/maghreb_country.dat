In 2015, the Turkish population of 79 million was of similar size as the populations of the three Maghreb countries together (84 million), and their working-age populations were about 53 and 57 million, respectively. Working-age populations are expected to grow to figures close to 61 million in Turkey and to 65 million in the Maghreb countries.

40|$|Increased {{globalization}} {{over the}} last two decades has led to strong growth in international business activity and international financial integration. This phenomenon covers a wide array of economic activities, including regional and international integration, investment and trade, international financial shocks and disturbances. This paper takes stock of current trends in regional financial integration and trade liberalization processes for the case of Maghreb countries. It aims also to examine the effects of these recent trends on economic growth in an era of growing globalization and frequent financial shocks. Using Multivariate Threshold Vector Autoregressive (MVTAR) estimation with data from 1990 to 2012, this study argues that the greater and deeper regional financial integration and trade will have positive repercussions for each <b>Maghreb</b> <b>country.</b> In addition, estimation results show that the regional financial integration process plays a positive role in enlarging the borders of countries as well as the market size of each country and, consequently, in stimulating economic growth. Finally, we can assert that the study argues that political and structural impediments continue to hamper regional integration...|$|E
30|$|All the {{aforementioned}} reasons strongly drive the Maghreb countries to merge their different national electricity systems {{into a larger}} and regional market that integrated with European electricity market. The political will for this target was expressed by {{the governments of the}} Arab Maghreb Union, which in 1989 created the Maghreb electricity committee Comite’ Maghrebin de l’Electricite’ (COMELEC). Besides the realization of a common internal electricity market, COMELEC envisages, as a long-term goal, a gradual integration and regulatory harmonization with the European electricity market [27, 28]. Particularly COMELEC members Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia have subscribed to this idea already technically interconnected with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) since 1997. At the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial meeting in late 2003, the European Commission and the energy ministers of the Maghreb nations signed a declaration with a protocol aimed at developing a regional energy market that would be progressively integrated into the EU electricity market. The protocol is not legally binding, but rather a declaration of intent, indicating commitment to reform. The protocol also creates a number of joint forums and institutions to bring the Maghreb countries together in the formation of an electricity market. In the protocol, each <b>Maghreb</b> <b>country</b> set its reform objective relating to introduction of competition or gradually opening of the electricity to certain eligible customers. As for the newly founded institutions: Ministerial Council; Permanent High Level Group; Expert Group; and Forum of Electricity Rules, they are composed by energy ministers from Maghreb countries, European Commission members and some energy companies. These institutions are mainly responsible for taking strategic decisions and formulating recommendations for the integration.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the total}} tariff levels in Tunisia {{are much higher}} than the ones in GCC {{countries}} and this condition can also be found in <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> the electricity tariffs are still lower than the benchmarks of EU countries. The residential tariffs are higher than commercial tariffs in <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> which proves that the reform of energy subsides has received positive feedbacks. Although the electricity tariff regulation in <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> are in a better progress than other Middle East region, the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> are heavily relying on energy export. Furthermore, the power sector monopoly in Tunisia will be a barrier for liberalization of electricity market in the future.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the impact of the integration of <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> into a free trade area on the main macroeconomic aggregates. By using the MIRAGE model and MacMap database, we tested different scenarios to estimate the gains or the potential losses of various plans of trade integration (Free trade area for the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> Custom Union between <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> Maghreban Common Market). Our study suggests that the overall gains from liberalizing trade in goods (and removing various regulatory non-tariff barriers in the process) could reach at least USD 350 million. The increase in revenue through increases in production and wages would positively affect welfare levels for Maghreb consumers. The dynamic gains from liberalizing trade in goods can outstrip the static gains, with productivity improvements as the main driver. Our analysis shows that the creation of a common market is probably the most interesting and efficient option for the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries.</b> ...|$|R

The organization of strikes by Algerian workers employed by Chinese firms or the repatriation of more than 30 000 Chinese workers from building sites in Libya has been widely reported.

To address the issue the chapter brings together statistics published by international institutions (UNCTAD and Eurostat) and by Chinese statistical services. Successively, the question of the direct investment in <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> the export of goods from <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> and the import of Chinese goods by <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> will be analysed.

In particular, by using panel analysis over the period 1980 ~ 2010, we evaluate if a monetary integration project across these countries is endogenous. Our main result suggests that while trade intensity may help to harmonize business cycles, {{the magnitude of this}} harmonization is lower for the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> than for industrial countries. This result is robust even when we take into consideration many control variables including intra-industry trade, economic diversification, and financial integration. Therefore, we suggest that an acceleration of trade linkage as well as product diversification should take place prior to any move towards monetary union across the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{terms of}} levels, the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>{{countries}}</b> compare favorably to {{the countries of}} the Middle East and other developing regions (Table 1). With a total population of 83 million (in 2005), the region is nearly equal in size to the Mashreq countries (108 million), but on an individual basis the Maghreb nations are dwarfed in the Middle East by Iran and Turkey (about 70 million each). Sustained by their energy wealth, Algeria and Libya lead the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> in per capita income (over $ 3, 000) are in the same league as higher-income developing countries in Latin America, Europe and Central Asia (about $ 4, 500). However, Maghreb income levels are skewed (especially in the case of Libya) and unreliable as indicators of general well-being, and they certainly do not reflect the circumstances of the lowerincome <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries,</b> which are less well-endowed with energy resources. Important to note is the recent modest growth of the <b>Maghreb</b> <b>countries</b> (about 2. 5 percent over 2001 - 2005) compared to the robust growth of the developing countries of East Asia (7. 4 percent), South Asia (4. 8 percent), and Europe and Central Asia (5. 2 per cent).
