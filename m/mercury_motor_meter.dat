50|$|In 1885 Ferranti {{offered a}} <b>mercury</b> <b>motor</b> <b>meter</b> with a {{register}} similar to gas meters; this {{had the advantage}} that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a DC meter by Dr Hermann Aron, who patented it in 1883. Hugo Hirst of the British General Electric Company introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888. Unlike their AC counterparts, DC meters did not measure energy. Instead they measured charge in ampere-hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, {{the reading of the}} meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example: if a meter recorded that 100 ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20 kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied. Aron's meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In any industry, {{the three}} top {{operating}} expenses are often {{found to be}} on energy, labor and materials. If one were {{to find out the}} potential cost savings in each of the components, energy would invariably emerge at the top, and thus energy management function constitutes a strategic area for cost reduction. This paper discusses the common aspects of electrical energy management in small- and medium-sized industries. It contains the findings and the analysis of the results obtained from the electrical energy audit program employed in an industrial unit, Loknayak J. P.

The electrical energy audit was carried out under three major heads: (i) lighting audit, (ii) power load audit (<b>motors,</b> <b>meters,</b> etc.), and (iii) harmonic analysis. Readings were taken under these heads and analyzed to find the scope of energy conservation opportunities in the selected test case industrial unit...|$|R

50|$|Allison {{was born}} December 3, 1937 in Miami, FL. He entered his first {{race as a}} senior at Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame High School in Miami. Since he was only 17, {{he had to have}} his parents' {{permission}} so he thought when his mother said ok, it was forever, but she thought it was for only one race. After graduating high school in 1955, Allison's mother thought she would derail his racing interest by sending him to Wisconsin to work for <b>Mercury</b> Outboard <b>Motors,</b> where her brother-in-law, Jimmy Hallett, was the national sales manager. Unbeknownst to her, Carl Kiekhaefer was the owner of <b>Mercury</b> Outboard <b>Motors,</b> where Allison ended up working as a mechanic and an engine tester. Carl Kiekhaefer also owned racecars. While employed at <b>Mercury</b> Outboard <b>Motors,</b> Allison worked in the boat division for 10 months, then was transferred to the racecar division. During the 2 months he worked in the racecar division for Carl Kiekhaefer, he went to 19 races—mostly Grand National (today known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series), and a few Convertible races. Every one of those races was won by a Carl Kiekhaefer car from the shop in which he worked. Kiekhaefer was a hard person to work for and several people got fired, so Allison {{decided to go back to}} Miami only after a little over 2 months. In 1956,having returned to Miami, Allison started his own racing again. His parents said he couldn't race and live at home, so Allison came up with a fictitious name (Bob Sunderman) which was used only once as he finished well enough to make the Sunday paper and his Dad saw it and knew who it was and told him that if he was going to race to do it with honor and use his own name. In 1959, Allison took his brother, Donnie, Kenny Andrews—who owned a car (whose Dad owned Andy Racing Wheels) and Gil Hearne went along as Kenny's driver on a quest for more lucrative racing than was available in South Florida. Their searching led them to Montgomery Motor Speedway in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was told of a race that very night in Midfield, Alabama near Birmingham. Allison entered and finished 5th in that race, which paid more than finishing 2nd in any big race in South Florida. He went to Montgomery the next night, won the preliminary races, and finished 2nd in the feature, winning $400, having found his lucrative racing. The brothers returned home and Bobby talked his friend Red Farmer into coming back to Alabama with him. They had immediate success and soon they began answering to the name The Alabama Gang. Allison became a known driver and won the national championship in the modified special division in 1962.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{one particular}} {{issue that the}} authors came across when developing a DC <b>Motor</b> Duty <b>Meter</b> - a comprehensive condition monitoring tool for large DC motors based on flux density measurement inside the motor air gap. This particular issue crucial for the project was how to calibrate, with high accuracy, {{a large number of}} flux density sensors to be used to measure the flux density distribution along the surface of the motor poles. From available literature and IEEE standards, the recommended and most common way to generate a calibration magnetic field is based on Helmholtz coil principle, which in practice is limited to small flux density magnitudes. A method used by the authors and described in this paper utilizes a step test and simple calculations based on Faraday's Law. The novelty of the described method is in particularities of the system, measurements and calculations, which make the method highly immune to typical sources of errors. The method can be used to produce a very accurate and uniform magnetic field with densities ranging from fractions of Tesla to above one Tesla to calibrate flux sensors in this flux range. Its accuracy is only limited by that of a current source, a current probe and a digital oscilloscope. Uniformity of the generated field is discussed and experimentally confirmed. Experimental results obtained within the DC <b>Motor</b> Duty <b>Meter</b> project are included to illustrate correctness of the sensor calibration. Conditions that guarantee the maximum efficiency of the method are discussed. The paper is concluded by a step by step calibration procedure that other researchers may find useful...|$|R

50|$|The first {{specimen}} of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced {{on the basis}} of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy's patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory {{at the end of the}} same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters. The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy's original invention.Also around 1889, Elihu Thomson of the American General Electric company developed a recording watt meter (watt-hour meter) based on an ironless commutator <b>motor.</b> This <b>meter</b> overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.|$|R
