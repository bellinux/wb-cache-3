40|$|IN 1888 Winkler {{published}} his well-known method for {{the determination of}} oxygen dissolved in water. The principle of the method is as follows. A solution of man-ganous chloride {{is added to the}} water to be analysed, followed by a solution of sodium hydroxide containing potassium iodide. A precipitate of manganous hydroxide is first formed thus: zMnClj + 4 NaOH = 4 NaCl + 2 Mn(OH) j. Part of this manganous hydroxide is then converted into <b>manganic</b> <b>hydroxide</b> by the oxygen dissolved in the water sample: 2 Mn(OH) a + HaO + O = 2 Mn(OH) 3. The solution is then acidified and oxidation of the potassium iodide takes place, iodine being liberated: 2 Mn(0 H) 3 + 2 KI + 6 HC 1 = 2 MnCla + 2 KCI + 6 H 2 O + 12. It is clear from the equations that each atom of oxygen in solution finally liberates one molecule of iodine. The iodine is titrated against sodium thiosulphate solution using starch as indicator; 1 c. c. of normal sodium thiosulphate solution corre-sponds to 8 mg. of oxygen, or 5 - 6 c. c. of oxygen at N. T. P. A number of modifications of the original technique of Winkler has been described. The accuracy both of the original method and also of any of its modi-fications is necessarily limited by the accuracy of the sampling technique. This factor is especially important when dealing with water of low oxygen concentration, for in order to obtain accurate analyses it is necessary to keep the water sample out of contact with the air. Krogh (1935) described a syringe pipette which could be used in the estimation of the oxygen content of water; by the use of such a pipette contamination of the water sample with atmospheric air was completely avoided. Van Dam (1933, 1935) modified Krogh's syringe pipette, {{and in the course of}} our studies of the respiration of aquatic animals we have further modified the syringe pipette of van Dam by replacing the metal collar with two locknuts.
