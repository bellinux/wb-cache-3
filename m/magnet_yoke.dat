50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where <b>magnet</b> <b>yokes</b> are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|R

The detector {{is designed to help}} measure the neutrino energy spectrum, to identify background and to calibrate the other detectors. The active elements of the SMRD consist of 0. 7 cm thick extruded scintillator slabs inserted into air gaps of the UA 1 <b>magnet</b> <b>yokes.</b> The readout of each scintillator slab is provided through a single WLS fiber embedded into a serpentine shaped groove.

40|$|Each beam {{arriving}} from the SPS has {{to pass through}} five injection septum magnets before being kicked onto the LHC orbit. The injection layout implies that the vacuum chambers for the two circulating beams pass through the septum <b>magnet</b> <b>yokes</b> at a flange distance from the chamber of the beam to be injected. Specially designed vacuum chambers and interconnections provide the required straightness and alignment precision, thus optimising the aperture for both the circulating and injected beams, without affecting {{the quality of the}} magnetic dipole field seen by the injected beam. The circulating beams are shielded against the magnetic stray field by using µ-metal chambers with a thickness of 0. 9 mm to avoid saturation of the µ-metal (0. 8 T), coated with copper (0. 4 mm) for impedance reasons and NEG for pumping and electron cloud purposes. A 2 mm gap between the iron yoke and the µ-metal chamber allows an in-situ bake-out at 200 °C, based on a polyimide/stainless steel/polyimide sandwich structure with an overall thickness of 0. 2 mm.
