50|$|The <b>mantled</b> <b>hawk</b> (Pseudastur polionotus) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of rare species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians.Threatened species include northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), Bahia tyrannulet (Phylloscartes beckeri) and cougar (Puma concolor).Bird species include the black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), <b>mantled</b> <b>hawk</b> (Pseudastur polionotus), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), cinnamon-vented piha (Lipaugus lanioides) and white-eared parakeet (Pyrrhura leucotis).|$|E
25|$|This species {{could be}} close to the white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), and perhaps to the grey-backed (Leucopternis occidentalis), white (L. albicollis), and <b>mantled</b> <b>hawks</b> (L. polionotus) which it resembles in habitus except for being larger. Its closest living {{relatives}} may well be the red-backed (B. polyosoma) and Puna hawks (B. poecilochrous). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard-eagles. The barred hawk (L. princeps) looks similar to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.|$|R

5000|$|The Guartel√° Canyon is {{considered}} the 6th largest canyon in the world, {{and the only one}} with native vegetation.The French naturalist Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1779-1853) calledit the [...] "terrestrial paradise of Brazil". Vegetation includes meadows, remnants of cerrado, araucaria forest, seasonal semi-deciduous forest and dense rainforest of the Atlantic Forest biome.Fauna include the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), howler monkeys, maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), tayra (Eira barbara), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), cougar (Puma concolor), pacas and common agoutis.The park is also home to deer and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).Birds include king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), <b>mantled</b> <b>hawk</b> (Pseudastur polionotus), blue-fronted amazon (Amazona aestiva) and vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea).|$|E
50|$|For a {{long time}} various systematists have {{proposed}} moving the slate-coloured hawk to Buteogallus. Together with the crab hawks and solitary eagles form a sequence of plumage patterns that nicely agrees with the DNA-based phylogeny: the slate-coloured hawk {{looks very much like}} a smaller, shorter-legged and lighter common black hawk. The case of the white-necked hawk is more puzzling. It is visually and ecologically almost identical to the sympatric <b>mantled</b> <b>hawk</b> (Leucopternis polionotus) and some allopatric white hawks (L. albicollis) but differs in tail color. According to the mtDNA data, it is very closely related to the savanna hawk, which is visually dissimilar, appearing like a very light Buteogallus which has an ochre-grey coloration due to abundant pheomelanins. Either there has been strong convergent evolution in plumage and ecology - perhaps a case of mimicry - between the white-necked and the mantled hawks, or the mtDNA data is misleading due to ancient hybrid introgression. In the respect, {{it is interesting to note}} that the white-necked hawk specimen sampled showed indications of heteroplasmy.|$|E
