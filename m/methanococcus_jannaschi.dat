40|$|Protein pin array {{technology}} {{was used to}} identify subunit–subunit interaction sites in the small heat shock protein (sHSP) αB crystallin. Subunit–subunit interaction sites were defined as consensus sequences that interacted with both human αA crystallin and αB crystallin. The human αB crystallin protein pin array consisted of contiguous and overlapping peptides, eight amino acids in length, immobilized on pins that were in a 96 -well ELISA plate format. The interaction of αB crystallin peptides with physiological partner proteins, αA crystallin and αB crystallin, was detected using antibodies and recorded using spectrophotometric absorbance. Five peptide sequences including 37 LFPTSTSLSPFYLRPPSF 54 in the N terminus, 75 FSVNLDVK 82 (β 3), 131 LTITSSLS 138 (β 8) and 141 GVLTVNGP 148 (β 9) that form β strands in the conserved α crystallin core domain, and 155 PERTIPITREEK 166 in the C-terminal extension were identified as subunit–subunit interaction sites in human αB crystallin using the novel protein pin array assay. The subunit–subunit interaction sites were mapped to a three-dimensional (3 D) homology model of wild-type human αB crystallin {{that was based on}} the crystal structure of wheat sHSP 16. 9 and <b>Methanococcus</b> <b>jannaschi</b> sHSP 16. 5 (Mj sHSP 16. 5). The subunit–subunit interaction sites identified and mapped onto the homology model were solvent-exposed and had variable secondary structures ranging from β strands to random coils and short α helices. The subunit–subunit interaction sites formed a pattern of hydrophobic patches on the 3 D surface of human αB crystallin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{universal}} {{stress protein}} UspA {{is a small}} cytoplasmic bacterial protein whose expression is enhanced several-fold when cellular viability is challenged with heat shock, nutrient starvation, stress agents which arrest cell growth, or DNA-damaging agents. UspA enhances the rate of cell survival during prolonged exposure to such conditions, suggesting that it asserts a general “stress endurance” activity. However, neither the structure of UspA nor the biochemical mechanism by which it protects cells from the broad spectrum of stress agents is known. Results: The crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae UspA reveals an asymmetric dimer with a tertiary α/β fold {{similar to that of}} the <b>Methanococcus</b> <b>jannaschi</b> MJ 0577 protein, a protein whose crystal structure revealed a novel ATP binding motif. UspA differs significantly from the MJ 0577 structure in several details, including the triphosphate binding loop of the ATP binding motif; UspA shows no ATP binding activity. Conclusions: Within the universal stress protein family that is delineated by sequence similarity, UspA is the only member which has been correlated with a cellular activity, and MJ 0577 is the only member which has been assigned a biochemical activity, i. e., ATP binding. UspA has a similar fold to the MJ 0577 protein but does not bind ATP. This suggests that members of this protein family will segregate into two groups, based on whether or not they bind ATP. By implication, one subset of the universal stress proteins presumably has an ATP-dependent function, while another subset functions in ATP-independent activities...|$|E
