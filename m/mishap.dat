50|$|In 1950, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps lost a {{total of}} 776 {{aircraft}} (roughly two aircraft per day or a rate of 54 major <b>mishaps</b> per 10,000 flight hours). Numerous technical initiatives, including the angled flight deck on aircraft carriers in 1954 and various standardization programs, were credited with significantly reducing the rate to 19 major <b>mishaps</b> per 10,000 flight hours by 1961, and further to nine major <b>mishaps</b> per 10,000 flight hours by 1970 (the current rate, for comparison, is under two major <b>mishaps</b> per 10,000 flight hours).|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} days of aviation, the vast {{majority}} of accidents were the result of mechanical failure. As aviation matured and the technology improved, more and more <b>mishaps</b> could be assigned to a problem in the human end of the equation. At present, these human problems, or human factors, make up the majority of causes of aircraft <b>mishaps.</b> One of the principal human factors that are causal in <b>mishaps</b> is spatial disorientation (SD). As shown in Figure 1 (see Page 2), which is drawn from USAF Safety Center data, the rate of USAF SD related <b>mishaps</b> per 100, 000 flying hours changed little from 1991 to 2000.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is imlimitedNaval Aviation aircraft <b>mishaps</b> {{continue to be}} of great concern due to {{the high cost of}} loss of life and aircraft. The goal of this thesis is to develop a predictive statistical model that accurately forecasts Marine Corps AV- 8 B Harrier aircraft <b>mishaps</b> based on existing monthly maintenance reports. Monthly maintenance reports provide numerous independent variables based on personnel levels and maintenance hours that could possibly be used to forecast aircraft <b>mishaps.</b> These variables were graphically analyzed to determine any relationships that could be exploited in developing the model. Higher order relationships were investigated by the method of principal components and logistic regression. After a thorough analysis, {{there appears to be no}} combination of variables in this particular data that could be used to forecast aircraft <b>mishaps.</b> The overall result of the thesis is that there is no relationship between monthly maintenance reports and aircraft <b>mishaps</b> that can be exploited to develop a predictive statistical model[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a specific}} type of USAF aircraft <b>mishaps</b> - Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) <b>mishaps.</b> The thesis presents data on CFIT <b>mishaps,</b> causes, and efforts to reduce CFIT <b>mishaps</b> through the development and adoption of Ground Collision Avoidance Systems (GCAS) or similar designs - Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS exist today on some USAF aircraft, but many times these systems are inadequate (as evidenced by the continued occurrence of CFIT <b>mishaps).</b> Both ongoing and future initiatives by the USAF to adopt and develop better GPWS/GCAS systems were studied. An analysis was performed which studied the cost to the USAF (and the U. S. taxpayer) as a result of CFIT <b>mishaps,</b> and compared with an analysis of the cost to develop and implement improved GPWS/GCAS systems. The results show conclusively that installing GCAS/GPWS on a majority of USAF aircraft is cost effective. Technology exist today which could improve existing GPWS performance, and although efforts to improve GPWS are moving forward, some resistance does exist. Possible reasons for resistance of GCAS/GPWS adoption were studied and several recommendations were made on how to improve the adoption of these systems within the USAF. by Jan W. Scofield.

The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific <b>mishap</b> causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing <b>mishap.</b> However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: Circumcision may be {{associated}} with complications which are usually minor but could be life threatening on certain occasions. This study determined contributory factors, pattern of presentation, challenges of management and outcome of circumcision <b>mishaps</b> in Benin City, Nigeria. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all male children managed for circumcision <b>mishaps</b> between January 1998 and December 2007 at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. Results: There were 346 male children aged between 6 days and 12 years. Period of presentation to the unit ranged between 1 hour and 12 years. Redundant prepuce, 51 (14. 7 &#x 0025;); glandulopenile adhesions, 30 (8. 7 &#x 0025;); implantation cyst, 10 (2. 9 &#x 0025;); penile chordee, 11 (3. 2 &#x 0025;); local wound infection, 17 (4. 9 &#x 0025;); and proximal migration of plastibell ring, 11 (3. 2 &#x 0025;), were common <b>mishaps</b> treated with good outcome. On the other hand, urethrocutaneous fistula, 73 (21. 1 &#x 0025;); hemorrhage, 46 (13. 3 &#x 0025;); glandular amputation, 9 (2. 6 &#x 0025;); penile tissue avulsion, 24 (7. 0 &#x 0025;); and transmission of infections, 4 (1. 2 &#x 0025;), were challenging <b>mishaps</b> to manage. These resulted in 18 children with residual penile deformity and 4 deaths. Challenging <b>mishaps</b> and late referrals were common among children circumcised by traditional circumcisionists (P < 0. 0001). Inadequate training of circumcisionists; circumcision in unhygienic environment; circumcision with unsterilized instruments; circumcision without the use of anesthesia, analgesia and antibiotics - which were compounded by late referrals - influenced the development and final outcome of circumcision <b>mishaps.</b> Conclusion: Circumcision <b>mishaps</b> presenting very late with resultant poor outcome are still common in our setting. Hospital circumcision by experts, health awareness campaigns, adequate training of circumcisionists and early referrals of affected children should be encouraged...|$|R
