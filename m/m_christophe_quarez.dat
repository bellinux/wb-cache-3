40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} a full-wave electromagnetic field simulator to verify terahertz (THz) transmission-mode spectroscopic measurements of periodic arrays containing subwavelength cylindrical scatterers. Many existing THz scattering studies utilize analytical solutions, which were developed for a single scatterer. For multiple scatterers, a scaling factor equal to the number of scatterers is applied, accounting for interference between far-field radiative contributions from those scatterers but not their near-field mutual coupling. Consequently, analytical solutions do not accurately verify measurements. Conversely, results from the full-wave electromagnetic field simulator elucidate our measurements well, and provide an important insight into how the scattering behavior of cylindrical scatterers is influenced by test conditions.

40|$|The muscle fiber is a {{structural}} unit of skeletal muscle in many organisms. Muscle fiber composition has {{been implicated in}} maintaining muscle longevity and controlling systemic energy homeostasis, however not much is known about how different types of muscle fibers are specified. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a useful model to study specification and differentiation {{of different types of}} muscle fiber. In this study, the functional properties of the transcription factor blistered (bs) were explored. The gene bs is evolutionarily conserved and has a mammalian homologue, Serum Response Factor (SRF). When bs is genetically down-regulated in all muscles, only a subset of muscles, called Indirect Flight Muscles, is affected and shows immature and disorganized myofibrils. The development of other muscles proceeds normally. To understand the role of bs in the selectivity towards Indirect Flight Muscles, I focus on identification of its targets, potential cofactors and the mechanism that governs fiber differentiation in skeletal muscle. Results suggest bs works in conjunction with pioneer factors, exd and hth, to regulate expression of flight muscle specific Act 88 F, thus providing a mechanism for flight muscle fiber specification.

40|$|The Religious Laws of the Qumran Community. J. M. Baumgarten. The Qumran Community, often {{defined as}} an "apocalyptic sect", is {{nonetheless}} remarkable for the importance it attributes to the law. Qumranian laws are either founded on the exegesis of the Torah, or presented in an apodictic fashion, without any scriptural justification. As with biblical law, Qumranian laws are revealed. These revelations are periodically renewed, guarded secret and transmitted only within the community. Contrary to the Pharisees whose halakhic prescriptions were uttered and transmitted by nominally designated wisemen, Qumranian laws remain anonymous. While the Pharisees distinguish between the oral and the written law, the notion of oral law is unknown to the Qumranians {{just as it is}} rejected by the Sadduceans. However the similarities between Qumranian and Sadducean prescriptions, in particular with respect to laws of purity, do not allow us to take the Qumranians for Sadduceans; the similarities rather indicate a meeting point of two distinct approaches: the first apply strickly within a separatist community, while the application of the second are reserved for the Temple and its rituals alone. On the other hand, the comparison of the Qumranian halakha with essenian practicies confirms down to the last detail the identification of the Essenians with the Qumran Community. The element of change in the conception of the law introduced by the belief in a progressive revelation must be interpreted with an eschatological perspective: the function of the Messiah or Messiahs being not to abrogate the law but to reveal its full significance. As for the origins of the religious laws of Qumran, we must again look to eschatology to understand: the extreme momism of the community could be interpreted in the light of its millenary and messianic ideology.

40|$|Mucinous {{differentiation}} {{is associated}} with both CpG island methylator phenotype and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer. The mucinous phenotype derives from abundant expression of the colonic goblet cell mucin, MUC 2, and de novo expression of gastric foveolar mucin, MUC 5 AC. We, therefore, investigated the protein expression levels of MUC 2 and MUC 5 AC, as well as MUC 5 B and MUC 6, in molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer. Seven-hundred and twenty-two incident colorectal carcinomas occurring in 702 participants of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study were characterized for methylator status, MLH 1 methylation, somatic BRAF and KRAS mutations, microsatellite-instability status, MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH 6, and PMS 2 mismatch repair, and p 53 protein expression, and their histopathology was reviewed. Protein expression levels of MUC 2, MUC 5 AC, MUC 5 B, MUC 6, and the putative mucin regulator CDX 2 were compared with molecular and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancers using odds ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. MUC 2 overexpression (> 25 % positive tumor cells) was observed in 33 % colorectal cancers, MUC 5 B expression in 53 %, and de novo MUC 5 AC and MUC 6 expression in 50 % and 39 %, respectively. Co-expression {{of two or more}} of the mucins was commonly observed. Expression of MUC 2, MUC 5 AC and MUC 6 was strongly associated with features associated with tumorigenesis via the serrated neoplasia pathway, including methylator positivity, somatic BRAF p. V 600 E mutation, and mismatch repair deficiency, as well as proximal location, poor differentiation, lymphocytic response, and increased T stage (all P< 0. 001). Overexpression was observed in tumors with and without mucinous differentiation. There were inverse associations between expression of all four mucins and p 53 overexpression. CDX 2 expression was inversely associated with MUC 2, MUC 5 AC and MUC 6 expression. Our results suggest that, in methylator-positive tumors, mucin genes on chromosome 11 p 15. 5 region undergo increased expression via mechanisms other than direct regulation by CDX 2.

40|$|Background: Despite a {{decreased}} {{incidence of}} acute rejection and early renal allograft loss due to calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in transplant recipients, nephrotoxicity associated with long-term CNI use remains an important issue. This study evaluated whether a CNI-free regimen, including sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and anti–interleukin- 2 receptor antibody induction, results in improved long-term renal function. Methods: This open-label, randomized, parallel group, comparative study in primary de novo renal transplant recipients was planned for 48 months but terminated early {{because of high}} acute rejection rates in the sirolimus arm. Results: Enrollment was stopped after ≈ 12 months, with 475 transplanted patients randomized (2 : 1) to sirolimus (n= 314) or cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment (n= 161). Mean length of follow-up after transplantation was 190 days; {{this article focuses on}} available data through 6 months. Mean±SD on-therapy Nankivell-calculated glomerular filtration rate was not significantly different between the sirolimus (69. 1 ± 18. 7 mL/min) and CsA (66. 0 ± 15. 2 mL/min) treatment groups. Occurrence and length of delayed graft function was not significantly different between groups. Patients in the sirolimus group experienced numerically lower survival rates (96. 9 % vs. 99. 4 %; P= 0. 14), with nine deaths reported with sirolimus and one with CsA; higher rates of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (21. 4 % vs. 6. 1 %; P< 0. 001); and higher rates of discontinuations due to adverse events (17. 4 % vs. 6. 8 %; P= 0. 001). Conclusion: A sirolimus-based, CNI-free immunosuppressive regimen, when used with mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and anti–interleukin- 2 receptor antibody induction, was associated with high rates of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection compared with CsA-based immunosuppression and is not recommended.
