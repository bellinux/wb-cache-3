25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she could name the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. <b>My</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> brothers have normal names. I got the odd name. In the beginning {{it was kind of}} rough. Kids used to tease me a little, but it fits my personality, because I feel like I'm a leader." [...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley. He was named the 2015 Korey Stringer Good Guy Award winner by media covering the Vikings. Munnerlyn is married to Lakisha and has two sons, Captain and Champ, and daughter, Eden.

5000|$|Nevertheless, a {{minority}} holds {{the work to}} be authentic. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a handful of articles began to call for its reevaluation, including references to more recently discovered journals and letters from Nietzsche and Cosima Wagner. Amok Books' 1990 edition reprints many secondary articles on the subject, and includes an original introduction calling for a reevaluation of the book. Nietzsche scholar Walter K. Stewart, in his 185 page monograph Nietzsche: <b>My</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>and</b> I — A Critical Study published in 2007, argues for the original's potential legitimacy by conducting a point-by-point analysis of Kaufmann's book review. [...] In his 2011 followup, Friedrich Nietzsche <b>My</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>and</b> I: Investigation, Analysis, Interpretation, Stewart uses direct textual analysis to argue that whoever wrote <b>My</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>and</b> I was intimate with every aspect of Nietzsche’s life and perspective.|$|R
