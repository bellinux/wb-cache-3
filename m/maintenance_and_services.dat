5000|$|On November 18, 2010, Lockheed Martin {{announced}} that it would be closing its Eagan, Minnesota location by 2013 to reduce costs and optimize capacity at its locations nationwide. In January 2011, Lockheed Martin agreed to pay the US Government $2 million to settle allegations that the company submitted false claims on a U.S. government contract for that amount. The allegations came from a contract with the Naval Oceanographic Office Major Shared Resource Center in Mississippi. On May 25, 2011 Lockheed Martin bought the first Quantum Computing System from D-Wave Systems. Lockheed Martin and D-Wave will collaborate to realize the benefits of a computing platform based upon a quantum annealing processor, as applied to some of Lockheed Martin's most challenging computation problems.

40|$|Providing <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> {{for high}} value complex {{products}} would extend manufacturers’ responsibilities and {{benefits to the}} products' whole usable life, and provide the opportunities to re-use or re-manufacture some failed parts. Sophisticated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in modern manufacturing systems are special products {{in that they are}} also used to manufacture other products, and their operation performance directly affects the quality of the manufactured parts as well as the performance of the entire manufacturing system. To ensure CNC machine tools’ consistent performance, appropriate and efficient <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> are essential and this is more challenging as technologies become more sophisticated and the environment is more dynamic. Previous research was mainly focused on maintenance strategy and maintenance scheduling. Very little effort was devoted to providing operational guidance for maintenance process execution, i. e., providing service suppliers with detailed information about resources needed for maintenance such as tooling, consumables, materials and spare parts, as well as service steps including disassembly and assembly of the serviced products. In this project, planning maintenance operation sequences, schedules and resource allocation are the three main tasks for generating final maintenance plans. This paper will present a Collaborative Maintenance Planning System (CoMPS) which will manage information and knowledge to support decision making in maintenance process planning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the different cassava processing machinery available, the most acceptable machine, effect of machines cost on the acceptability of mechanisation, cost of <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> of the machines in Iwo Local Government Area, Osun State, Nigeria. The survey was undertaken using structured questionnaires administered through a participatory learning technique. The local government was divided into four zones and four processing centres were chosen from each zone to give a total of 16 processing centres. A total of 160 machines were recorded. Grating machines, 75 (46. 9 %), pressing machine, 59 (36. 9 %), sifting machines, 3 (1. 8 %), milling machines, 33 (14. 4 %) in all the processing centres. Peeling, washing, slicing, chipping, drying and frying operations were predominantly done manually. Sources of power of the machines are: diesel (84. 7 %), petrol (9. 4 %), electricity (5. 9 %). The diesel engine was widely utilised due to the ruggedness of the processing operations. High cost of most of the machines, cost of <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> were constraint to acquisition of the already available machines in the market. Maintenance and service culture of most of the processors were poor and this affected the durability of the machines. This study revealed that certain cassava processing operations were met for a particular sex. Grating, dewatery, milling operations were predominantly for men while peeling, washing, drying and frying operations were common among women...|$|E
40|$|We present our {{monitoring}} and decision framework for collaborative engineering for globally distributed operation, support, <b>maintenance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> for industrial automation. The framework provides relevant information to plant operators, engineers, staff and stakeholders {{to support the}} handling of incidents, based on semantically-appropriate factors such as personnel skills, physical location of affected equipment and dependencies between plant elements. We discuss the proposed application and present the architecture and implementation. Based on incoming events the framework selects, aggregates and displays information automatically for human processing possibly at distant control centres. For example an alarm in a manufacturing facility can trigger the display of relevant information on multiple devices such as workstations, tablets, or large control-room screens to supervisors and experts. Devices can be potentially in different locations and can comprise different visualization capabilities. The core of our framework uses semantic models and formal methods-based techniques to aggregate and process this information...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of structural health monitoring (SHM) often employs multiple sensors {{to monitor the}} state of health and usage of the structures. The fault of any sensor may lead to an inaccurate or even incorrect inference with the collected sensor data, which will accordingly create {{a negative impact on}} higher-level decisions for <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>services.</b> Thus, sensor validation becomes a critical process to the performance of the whole SHM system. This paper presents the use of Bayesian belief network to validate the reading of strain gauges on an aluminum plate for loading monitoring. The Bayesian belief network is constructed with the training data. The factors investigated in this paper, which may affect the validation process, include sensor configuration, sensor redundancy, and sensor data range for the discretization. The feasibility of using a Bayesian belief network for SHM sensor validation is demonstrated with the experimental results. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|From product <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> {{point of}} view, high-value {{sophisticated}} {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools in modern manufacturing factories play important roles: they are manufacturing equipment, {{and on the other}} hand, they are also products supplied by equipment manufacturers. There is a trend that manufacturers are extending their responsibilities to the products use phase to meet customers’ requirements for lifetime support <b>and</b> <b>service.</b> To ensure the effective performance <b>and</b> efficient <b>maintenance</b> of high-value machine tools, information and knowledge from their lifecycle should be collected and reused. However, in the research area of product <b>service</b> systems <b>and</b> related computerised <b>maintenance</b> systems, {{there is a lack of}} research work on how to integrate knowledge from different stakeholders into the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> planning process, which is important for modern digital manufacturing systems to reduce machine tools’ downtime and improve their working performance. This project proposed a collaborative maintenance planning framework to connect different stakeholders and integrate their knowledge into the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> process. The potential of advanced content management systems (CMSs), which are widely used non-engineering sectors such as finance, business, publishing and government organisations, has been explored and tested for applications in the manufacturing engineering domain. The research realised that CMSs have several advantages compared with traditional engineering information systems, especially in managing dynamic and unstructured knowledge.
