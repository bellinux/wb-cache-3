40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{potential}} of using DVDÐdigital versatile discÐfor language learning. Seven hypotheses are presented on how oral pro®ciency may be developed within multimedia classroom environments. These hypotheses are culled from several areas of SLA research. They focus on how language acquisition may be accomplished within a FL teaching situation, i. e., in the home country of the language learner {{with little or no}} face-to-face access to native speakers of the target language. It is argued that multimedia applications, particularly digital video, provide language teachers and learners with effective means to make language acquisition in the classroom viable in a way that has not been possible before the advent of powerful <b>multimedia</b> <b>computers.</b> Consequently, foreign language classrooms need to be equipped with <b>multimedia</b> <b>computers</b> and projectors so that digital video may be used for presentation and practice as well as the acquisition of listening and speaking pro®ciency. Through digital videoÐand through other features of digital media such as easy communication around the worldÐteaching and learning conditions in FL classrooms may become similar to conditions that apply when living in th...|$|R
