5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{took place}} from March to June 1937 in the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta. It was a rebellion against Premier William Aberhart {{by a group}} of backbench (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from his Social Credit League. The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as he had promised before his 1935election. When the government's 1937budget <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a confidence vote.|$|E
5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> against Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed {{him as a}} threat to their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E

Taft called on the chief justice on March 26, and found White ill, but still {{carrying}} on his work and not talking of retiring. White did not retire, dying in office on May 19, 1921. Taft issued {{a tribute to the}} man he had appointed to the center seat, and waited and worried if he would be White's successor. Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement. Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose of}} considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos quickly began {{regrouping}} {{his forces}} {{and sent the}} general Theodore Krateros to Ancyra. Krateros found the city completely deserted, and was ordered to reinforce the garrison of Amorium instead. Theophilos himself was soon forced to return to Constantinople, where rumours of his death at Anzen had led to plots to declare a new emperor. At the same time, the Khurramites, gathered around Sinope, revolted and declared their reluctant commander Theophobos emperor. Luckily for the Empire, Theophobos maintained a passive stance and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to confront Theophilos or join Mu'tasim. The caliph's vanguard under Ashinas reached Ancyra on 26 July. The inhabitants, who had sought refuge in some mines nearby, were discovered and taken captive after a brief struggle by an Arab detachment under Malik ibn Kaydar al-Safadi. The Byzantines, {{some of whom were}} soldiers who had fled from Anzen, informed the Arabs of Afshin's victory, after which Malik allowed all of them to go free. The other Arab forces arrived at Ancyra over the next days, and after plundering the deserted city, the united Arab army turned south towards Amorium.|$|E

50|$|In 1714, {{following}} a long disagreement between the ministers, Anne dismissed Harley; the arch-Tory Bolingbroke became in effect Anne's chief minister, and Tory power {{seemed to be}} at its zenith. However, Anne was extremely ill and died within a few days. Bolingbroke {{had not been able}} to formulate any coherent plans for dealing with the succession; if he thought of proclaiming the son of James II (the Pretender) king, he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> to do so. The Elector George succeeded to the throne entirely peacefully.|$|R
5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. He seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the ecclesiastic see to a dynastic realm ruled by a Protestant prince challenged the principle of ecclesiastical reservation, which was intended to preserve the ecclesiastical electorates from this very possibility. The difficulties of such a conversion had been faced before: Hermann von Wied, a previous prince-elector and archbishop in Cologne, had also converted to Protestantism, but had resigned from his office. Similarly, Gebhard's predecessor, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau had indeed married in 1577, but had resigned from the office prior to his marriage. Furthermore, {{the reason for his}} marriage—to perpetuate his house—differed considerably from Gebhard's. The House of Waldburg was in no apparent danger of extinction; Gebhard was one of six brothers, and only one other had chosen an ecclesiastical career. Unlike his abdicating predecessors, when Gebhard converted, he proclaimed the Reformation in the city of Cologne itself, angering Cologne's Catholic leadership and alienating the Catholic faction in the Cathedral Chapter. Furthermore, Gebhard adhered not to the teachings of Martin Luther, but to those of John Calvin, a form of religious observation not approved by the Augsburg conventions of 1555. Finally, he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to resign from his position as Prince-elector.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to {{challenge}} Stopford or Gambier, {{although he had}} successfully united with the Rochefort squadron of three ships of the line, two frigates and an armed storeship, the captured British fourth rate ship Calcutta, commanded by Commodore Gilbert-Amable Faure. Together the French fleet, now numbering 11 ships of the line, withdrew from the relatively open Basque Roads anchorage into the narrow channel under the batteries of the Île-d'Aix known as the Aix Roads. These waters offered greater protection from the British fleet, but were also extremely hazardous; on 26 February, as the French manoeuvred into the shallower waters of their new anchorage the 74-gun Jean-Bart grounded on the Palles Shoal off Île Madame, and was wrecked. The channel in which Willaumez chose to position his fleet formed a strong defensive position: an assailant had to cross the open Basque Roads and advance past the long and dangerous Boyart Shoal hidden just below the surface. On entering the channel, an attacking force would then come under fire from fortified gun batteries on Île-d'Aix before finally encountering the French fleet. The anchorage had been successfully attacked before, such as during the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, but more recent efforts in 1803, and 1807 had ended in failure.|$|E

5000|$|The Letter to Chesterfield (February 1755) was Samuel Johnson's {{response}} to what some believed to be Lord Chesterfield's opportunistic endorsement of his A Dictionary of the English Language. Although Chesterfield was patron of the Proposal for the Dictionary, he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> to further {{the progress of the}} Dictionary until seven years after his original investment into the project. Suddenly, Chesterfield wrote two [...] "puff" [...] pieces to promote the Dictionary, which prompted Johnson to write a letter accusing Chesterfield of only providing help when it was least needed.|$|R
50|$|On August 7, the D-Backs {{acquired}} RHP Liván Hernández {{from the}} Washington Nationals {{in exchange for}} minor league pitching prospects Garrett Mock and Matt Chico. Hernandez was 9-8 this season as of August 7, with a 5.34 ERA in 24 starts. The Diamondbacks flirted with trading for a pitcher before the July 31 trade deadline but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> at that time; after All-Star Brandon Webb (the ace of the Diamondback pitching staff and widely considered {{a candidate for the}} NL Cy Young Award) missed his scheduled August 5 start against Houston with a sore elbow, it became more urgent to add a starter to the rotation.|$|R

However, he hesitated until too late in the day and was unable to strike a conclusive blow before dark. By 7 December 4 Armoured Brigade had closed up and the opportunity lost. Worse, 15th Panzer's skilful commander, Neumann-Silkow was mortally wounded late on the 6th.|$|E
25|$|Then in 726, Leo {{issued an}} iconoclast edict, condemning {{possession}} of any {{icon of the}} saints. Although Leo <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to enforce this edict in the west beyond having it read in Rome and Ravenna, Gregory immediately rejected the edict. Upon hearing this, the Exarchate of Ravenna rose in revolt against the imperial imposition of iconoclasm. The armies of Ravenna and the Duchy of the Pentapolis mutinied, denouncing both Exarch Paul and Leo III, and overthrew those officers who remained loyal. Paul rallied the loyalist forces and attempted to restore order, but was killed. The armies discussed electing their own emperor and marching on Constantinople, but were dissuaded by Pope Gregory from acting against Leo. At the same time, the self described “duke” Exhilaratus and his son Hadrian rebelled in Naples, sided with the emperor and marched on Rome in order to kill Gregory, but were overthrown by the people and killed.|$|E
25|$|Baghdad fell to Ma'mun's {{forces in}} September 813, after a brutal year-long siege, and Amin was executed. Ma'mun however {{remained}} in Khurasan and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> {{to come to}} Baghdad, entrusting the governance of the Caliphate to Fadl ibn Sahl and his Khurasani friends. This provoked great resentment in Iraq, and when Ma'mun chose an Alid as his heir, the old Abbasid elites of Baghdad rose up in 817 and raised Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi as Caliph {{in the place of}} Ma'mun. However, when Ma'mun finally began to advance on Baghdad, Ibrahim's support collapsed. Fadl re-emerged briefly from hiding during this time in support of Ibrahim, but when Ma'mun entered the capital in 819, he secured his pardon. During his last years, Fadl even enjoyed a return to the Caliph's favour due to his long experience and loyal service to the Abbasid house. He died in Baghdad in the spring of 823 or 824.|$|E
50|$|After the 1934 elections, where Gray {{was not a}} candidate, he {{and several}} other Labor {{officials}} were charged with violating Western Australia's Electoral Act 1907. They were alleged to have issued a pamphlet that contained defamatory statements about Thomas Hughes, a Nationalist candidate who unsuccessfully opposed Labor's Gilbert Fraser in West Province. Gray was convicted of the offence and fined A£20 plus costs, although he claimed he had {{had nothing to do}} with writing the pamphlet. This conviction should have automatically disqualified Gray from sitting in parliament, but the Legislative Council <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> to expel him and the Labor government arranged for him to be pardoned by the lieutenant-governor, Sir James Mitchell.|$|R
50|$|Captain Jones {{had taken}} a small group with him, Major Hunt, Lt. Crosby, Lt. Hand, George, the native pilot, and Sgt Daniel J.

They saw a number of transports, two hospital ships and numerous escorting men-of-war ships. As they were about one-half hour, all the ships {{of the task force}} left the area. About 1 nmi km from the Task Force, Hunt spotted the 'feather' of a submerged periscope 700 yd from their position. The submarine <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> toward the small party, so they returned to the atoll. No physical contact was made with the approaching task force.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} Richard's promise to uphold her interests, his {{close friend and}} ally, Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell claimed that the Hastings manors of Ashby and Bagsworth, and the Beaumont estates belonged to him, {{although}} these had been left to Katherine following her husband's execution. In order for Katherine to retain these properties, she was compelled to pay Lovell the sum of 200 marks in cash and give him lands totalling the same amount per annum. Richard <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to curtail the avarice of his friend, who had assumed a powerful role in the government during the King's brief reign. King Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485 and the Lancastrian victor, Henry Tudor subsequently ascended the throne as Henry VII. Katherine's eldest surviving son, Edward fought {{on the side of}} King Henry against Lovell at the Battle of Stoke in June 1487. This battle saw the final defeat of the House of York and Lovell, as one of the Yorkists' chief leaders, afterwards fled to Scotland; however, his eventual fate remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} preceded by the attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole massacre. The British sent {{reinforcements}} under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal and recaptured Calcutta. Clive then seized the initiative to capture the French fort of Chandernagar. Tensions and suspicions between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The battle was waged during the Seven Years' War (1756–63), and, in a mirror of their European rivalry, the French East India Company (La Compagnie des Indes Orientales) sent a small contingent {{to fight against the}} British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British, worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Omichund and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army with 50,000 soldiers, 40 cannons and 10 war elephants was defeated by 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators. The battle was ended in 11 hours.|$|E
500|$|Following Callaghan's visit, some {{barricades}} were breached, but {{the majority}} remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform.

30|$|Unlike Singapore and Hong Kong, Macao has <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> in the {{direction}} of restricting motor vehicles. Although the land mass is much smaller than these two other island city-states, and with higher population density, Macao has taken a transport pathway closer to that on the Mainland. However, Zhuhai, has not only banned motorbikes but also electric bicycles, while devoting much space to car infrastructure. As incomes in Macao rose rapidly from 2000, people have acquired motorbikes and then cars. The approach in the new development is to use underground space, at least in part, to move and store the cars. The planned flows between Zhuhai and Macao, in contrast with those between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, are motorised. In this sense, the plan is designed to accommodate the market and to implement a synchrony with its Mainland neighbour.|$|R
500|$|On July 28, Japanese papers {{reported}} that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki Kantarō declared {{at a press conference}} that the Potsdam Declaration {{was no more than a}} rehash (yakinaoshi) of the Cairo Declaration and that the government intended to ignore it (mokusatsu, [...] "kill by silence"). The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to change the government position. Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the imperial institution; that Japan not be occupied; that the Japanese armed forces be disbanded voluntarily; and that war criminals be prosecuted by Japanese courts.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee's {{relations}} with the federal parties were somewhat more harmonious. [...] While he personally preferred the Liberals, his history with Bennett led to a cordial working relationship. [...] Both parties made overtures towards Brownlee: King had invited him to join his cabinet {{while he was still}} attorney-general, and in 1932 sent an emissary to encourage union of all political parties opposed to the Conservatives. [...] Brownlee reiterated his policy to deal [...] "equally with Liberals and Conservatives in Ottawa", and declined King's overtures. [...] So too did Alberta Liberals, led by Howson and Charles Stewart, who sought to replace Brownlee rather than join with him. [...] In 1934, the Conservatives sent H. R. Milner to raise the possibility of the UFA and the Conservatives joining together against the Liberals and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; Brownlee expressed interest, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to enact such a coalition. [...] A frustrated Bennett dismissed him as [...] "a time server whose one object, apparently, is to retain office." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{course of}} events in East Anglia is less clear, but Eadwald's coinage ceased, and new coinage issued by Coenwulf began by about 805, so {{it is likely that}} Coenwulf {{forcibly}} re-established Mercian dominance there. The resumption of friendly relations with Wessex under Beorhtric received a setback when Beorhtric died and the throne of Wessex passed to Egbert, who, like Eadberht, had been an exile at Charlemagne's court. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that {{on the same day that}} Egbert came to the throne, an ealdorman of the Hwicce named Æthelmund led a force across the Thames at Kempsford but was defeated by the men of Wiltshire under the leadership of Weohstan, also an ealdorman. Egbert may also have had a claim on the Kentish throne, according to the Chronicle, but he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>move</b> to recover it during Coenwulf's reign. Egbert appears to have been independent of Mercia from the beginning of his reign, and Wessex's independence meant that Coenwulf was never able to claim the overlordship of the southern English that had belonged to Offa and Æthelbald. He did, however, claim the title of [...] "Emperor" [...] on one charter, the only Anglo-Saxon king to do so before the 10th century.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers a}} close {{reading of the}} {{discourse}} on Italian fascism within the authoritative Italian Jesuit periodical La Civilta Cattolica. The author shows that, when confronted with the fascist movement, La Civilta Cattolica <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>moves</b> to oppose the regime, instead positioning itself so as to negotiate with and accommodate the fascist rhetoric. This decision was driven {{in part by the}} close alignment between the politics of Catholicism and fascism, and further fostered by the absence of a viable alternative political power. The article also illustrates the manner in which Catholic intellectuals intuitively perceived some aspects of fascist totalitarianism and the 'sacralization of politics' as threatening, particularly when confronted with manifestations of what was termed 'political heresy', along with certain features of fascist associationalism. However, despite their concerns no explicit rupture between Church and regime ever eventuated; on the contrary, some accounts imply an intended merger, however unstable it may have proven, between the 'religious' and 'totalitarian' goals of both parties...|$|R
