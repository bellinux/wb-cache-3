40|$|New {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages {{were obtained}} from fine-grained fluvial sediment exposed in a well-preserved outcrop {{at the southern end}} of the San Juan Mountains, Durango, Colorado (Z 13, 249144 mE, 4132617 mN; 2098 m). The sedimentary sequence exposed in the ~ 4 meter high outcrop consists of multiple and repetitive sets of mm-size rhythmite couplets, climbing ripples, planar laminae, and minor, small-scale water escape structures, overlain by a diamicton; the outcrop was previously interpreted as a remnant of the glacial landscape formed during a Bull Lake glacial advance (MIS 5 d - 6). Three samples collected along a vertical transect (~ 0. 8 meters apart) yielded preliminary ages of ~ 50 ± 10 ka, 51. 61 ± 8. 07 ka, and ~ 65 ± 13 ka (MIS 4, early Wisconsin Glaciation, ~ 55 ka). The OSL ages are asynchronous with northern hemisphere glacial maximums. No previous studies have reported significant asynchronous glacial advances as far south as the study area (~ 37 ° 17 ’ N latitude). Alternative explanations were sought to explain the seemingly anomalous ages, including: (1) OSL bleaching; (2) abandoned meander sequences in the adjacent glacial valley (Animas River); and, (3) deposition from a stream that presently occupies an incised channel and flows ~parallel to the outcrop (Spring Creek). Sediment deposited in glacial environments is often inadequately bleached, but OSL has been successfully used on glaciofluvial deposits. Insufficient bleaching would yield older ages, which suggests that the sedimentary sequence in this study is not correlative with older Bull Lake glacial deposits. Similarly, a lack of trough cross-bedded sands, mud drapes, lateral accretion surfaces, and fining upward sequences argue against a <b>meander</b> <b>sequence.</b> It is also difficult to explain the process linkage that would yield the change of stream flow direction required for sediment to have been deposited by an entrenched stream that, at present, drains away from the outcrop. Field evidence from the isolated outcrop was insufficient to definitely determine sediment provenance and glacial origin. Consequently, we remain open to the prospect that this outcrop may represent the first quantitative ages of a significant asynchronous glacial advance in the southern San Juan Mountains...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} a meander is {{introduced}} and studied. Roughly speaking, a <b>meander</b> is a <b>sequence</b> of integers (drawn from the set N= [1, 2, …, n]) that wanders {{back and forth between}} various subsets of N a lot. Using Ramsey theoretic proof techniques we obtain sharp lower bounds on the minimum length of meanders that achieve various levels of wandering. We then apply these bounds to improve existing lower bounds on the length of constant width branching programs for various symmetric functions. In particular, an Ω (n log n) lower bound on the length of any such program for the majority function of n bits is proved. We further obtain optimal time-space trade-offs for certain input oblivious branching programs and establish sharp lower bounds on the size of weak superconcentrators of depth 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the lower {{reach of the}} Manzanares river valley between Villaverde and its confluence in the Jarama river. In this zone the valley is asymmetric {{with the development of}} large escarpments (on gypsums) at the left bank and extensive fluvial terraces on its right one. Among the different fluvial levels the most representative is a complex (thickened) one labelled as TCMZ (+ 16 - 22 m). This terrace is constituted by at least five fluvial <b>meandering</b> <b>sequences</b> composed of white arkoses (Mz). Younger sequences of mixed nature (arkoses + lithoarenites: Mx levels) develop between + 15 and + 8 m, overlapping the TCMZ, and displaying a more braided character. During the development of the different Mz and Mx levels there was a relevant participation of lateral deposits coming from the main tributaries (Butarque and Culebro), gypsum escarpments (colluviums) and/or from the reelaboration of earlier terrace scarps (glacis). The TCMZ is the highest terrace leve 1 in this sector, working additionally as the watershed of the Manzanares river valley (another anomaly). Al 1 these anomalous characters are consequence of the system response to the river capture of the Manzanares by the Jarama river during the middle Pleistocene. The palaeontological and archaeological content of the TCMZ suggest that this thickened terrace developed between the OIS 10 (?) and OIS 5. A relevant paleoseismic crisis during the early OIS 5 predates the first major incision period after the river capture. Cold resistant faunas and mousterian relics are characteristic in the Mx terrace levels, being possible to assign their development between the OIS 4 and OIS 3. Whatever the case, the intervening cut & fill episodes shaping the fluvial landscape during the Late Pleistocene, hardly can be related to eustatic changes in the Tajo river-mouth at Lisbon (ea. 650 km away). A realistic understanding of river valley evolution in the studied zone, should conjugate climatic changes (limiting the water and sediment supply during the end of cold periods) with relevant neotectonic and karstic activity, feedback by significant intrabasinal headward erosion processes from the late Middle Pleistocene. Se analiza el tramo Inferior del Manzanares entre Villaverde y su desembocadura en el r&# 237;o Jarama. En este tramo, el valle es de car&# 225;cter asim&# 233;trico con desarrollo de escarpes en Yesos (ea. 60 m) en su margen izquierda y de terrazas complejas en su margen derecha. Dentro de ellas la que domina la geomorfolog&# 237;a del sector es un nivel de terraza complejo (engrosado) que denominamos TCMZ (+ 16 - 22 m). Se encuentra constituido por al menos cinco secuencias fluviales (Mz) de tipo meandriforme. Sobre ellas se solapan a doble vertiente niveles mixtos (Mx) desde los + 15 a los + 8 m que poseen un car&# 225;cter (m&# 225;s) braided. En la arquitectura de la TCMZ participan muy significativamente aportes laterales procedentes de los tributarios (Butarque y Culebro), de los relieves marginales (escarpes en yesos) y de los propios sistemas de terrazas (derrames de escarpes). La TCMZ es el nivel m&# 225;s alto en este sector sobre el que, adem&# 225;s, se instala la propia divisoria del Valle en este sector, constituyendo este hecho el car&# 225;cter m&# 225;s an&# 243;malo del valle. Todos estos caracteres poco usuales son resultado directo de la respuesta del sistema fluvial al proceso de captura que sufri&# 243; por parte del Jarama durante el Pleistoceno medio. Los contenidos faun&# 237;sticos y l&# 237;ticos de la TCMZ permiten situar su desarrollo entre los OIS 10 (?) al 5. Una manifiesta crisis paleos&# 237;smica a comienzos del OIS 5 acompa&# 241;a al primer episodio de disecci&# 243;n importante en el valle despu&# 233;s del proceso de Captura. Las faunas fr&# 237;as e industrias musterienses de los niveles Mx permiten ubicar su desarrollo entre el OIS 4 y 3. En cualquier caso hay que considerar que los episodios de cut & fill que han modelado el paisaje fluvial durante el Pleistoceno superior dif&# 237;cilmente responden a los cambios eust&# 225;ticos que estuvo sometido el Tajo en su lejana desembocadura en Lisboa (ca. 650 km). Cambios clim&# 225;ticos (en lo referente a disponibilidad de aportes h&# 237;dricos y flujo de sedimento desde las cabeceras), as&# 237; como fen&# 243;menos neotect&# 243;nicos y k&# 225;rsticos retroalimentados por importantes procesos de erosi&# 243;n remontante intracuencales han de conjugarse adecuadamente para entender la evoluci&# 243;n reciente de este complejo sistema fluvial...|$|R
40|$|River {{restoration}} aims {{to improve}} physical natural form and processes of a river. Techniques {{to control the}} riverbed, stabilize channel alignment, protect stream banks, and rebuild the natural habitat {{are an important part}} of river restoration projects. Rivers can be stabilized and habitat restored through techniques such as rebuilding <b>meanders</b> and pool-riffle <b>sequences</b> and managing large wood. Structures that limit channel width to accelerate the normal flows through the constricted section are referred to as stream deflectors. Single-wing, double-wing and triangular deflectors are the most commonly used types of this measure. Log-frame deflectors consist of a triangular log frame filled with rock. Deflector constructions singly or in series in low gradient meandering streams, divert base flows toward the center of the channel and, under certain conditions, increase the depth and velocity of flow thereby creating scour pools and enhancing fish habitat. Scour characteristics and morphologies downstream of log-frame deflectors have been analyzed at the hydraulic laboratory of the University of Pisa. All experiments have been carried out in clear water conditions. The results showed that the tailwater depth plays an important role on scour characteristics. In addition, it was experimentally proven that using log-frame deflectors instead of log-deflectors result in a better river bank protection. In this case, for all the tested hydraulic conditions, the scour hole never occurred close to the channel bank. Useful empirical relationships have been proposed in order to evaluate the main features of the scour geometry...|$|R
