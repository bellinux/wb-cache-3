5|$|Both H.repandum and {{the variety}} album contain the diepoxide {{compound}} repandiol (2R,3R,8R,9R)-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which {{was shown to}} have potent cytotoxic activity against various tumor cells in laboratory culture. At the molecular level, repandiol is an alkylating agent. It inserts crosslinks between strands of DNA, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for the genetic material to be expressed or replicated.|$|E
5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{associate}} their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E

5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} only for the most advanced abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to establish defining features of the skeleton for the family as a whole. However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull.|$|E
5|$|The tumor may {{compress}} neighboring organs, disrupting {{digestive processes}} and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for the stomach to empty, which may cause nausea {{and a feeling}} of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is common.|$|E
5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official {{should be able to}} identify it.|$|E

5|$|In the Iowa caucuses, Keyes did {{not appear}} {{on any of the}} {{election}} totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to run an effective campaign.|$|E
5|$|Most of Jennings {{second term}} was spent {{grappling}} with the state's continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state's revenue was not sufficient to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate {{the value of its}} bonds, harming the state's credit and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to secure new loans.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{nature of}} design management leads to varied opinion, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to give an}} overall definition; furthermore, design managers have {{a broad range of}} roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market situation, and the importance of design within the organization's activities. As a result, design management is not restricted to a single design discipline and usually depends on the context of its application within an individual organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} railways during railway mania caused coaching services to dry up. Along {{with many other}} turnpike routes, the New Direct Road fell into disrepair during the 19th century owing {{to a lack of}} funds and available staff.

5|$|These {{are used}} to cover the {{cylinder}} valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to remove.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E

Torrential rain was falling, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to resupply the forward positions, particularly Starvation Hill. On 1 October eight Douglas A-20 Havoc bombers of the US 89th Bombardment Squadron attacked the Japanese positions in the Salankaua Plantation and Kakakog Ridge area at 10:35, followed by ten Vultee Vengeance dive bombers of No. 24 Squadron RAAF. This was followed by twenty 25-pounders of the 2/12th Field Regiment firing 30 rounds per gun.|$|E
