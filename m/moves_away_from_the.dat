5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tropics.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E

25|$|Not far off {{the coast}} of the North Pacific lies a {{spreading}} ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created.

On {{the other side of the}} spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca and Gorda Plates move eastward.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} using such a plan, a POS plan has levels of {{progressively}} higher patient financial participation, as the patient <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more managed {{features of the}} plan. For example, if patients stay in a network of providers and seeks a referral to use a specialist, {{they may have a}} copayment only. However, if they use an out of network provider but do not seek a referral, they will pay more.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronegative}} element {{need not}} be directly bonded to the acidic hydrogen to increase its acidity. An electronegative atom can pull electron density out of an acidic bond through the inductive effect. The electron-withdrawing ability diminishes quickly as the electronegative atom <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> acidic bond. The effect {{is illustrated by the}} following series of halogenated butanoic acids. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and therefore has a stronger effect. The hydrogen atom bonded to the oxygen is the acidic hydrogen. Butanoic acid is a carboxylic acid.|$|E

During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest.

25|$|Scales: While, as {{mentioned}} under Fingering, a player will usually play a given instrument {{only in its}} tonic key and possibly in the key beginning on the fourth (e.g. G on a D whistle), nearly any key is possible, becoming progressively more difficult to keep in tune as the player <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> whistle's tonic, according to the circle of fifths. Thus a D whistle is fairly apt for playing both G and A, and a C instrument can be used fairly easily for F and G.|$|E
25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the distillate at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the distillate <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|E

25|$|The ‘‘hiding’’ effect {{takes into}} account the fact that, while small grains are {{inherently}} more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.|$|E
25|$|During each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. The {{blood pressure}} in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, {{although most of the}} fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence {{blood pressure in}} veins.|$|E
25|$|These {{mid-range}} stars ultimately {{reach the}} tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning. They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly oxygen or carbon enriched, {{depending on the type of}} the star. The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a circumstellar envelope and cools as it <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> star, allowing dust particles and molecules to form. With the high infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation.|$|E

25|$|We now {{discuss the}} {{position}} using the superko rule. For simplicity, {{we assume that}} the last move placed a stone in a position unoccupied {{since the beginning of the}} game, and away from the ko. Under positional and situational super ko, Black captures the white group. This is also the case with natural situational super ko if it is Black's turn. If it is White's turn however, then NSSK exhibits odd behavior. White can get a seki by passing, but only at the cost of allowing Black unlimited <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ko. If White insists on saving their group, the final position might look like the second diagram. On the other hand, with the first move (which should be a pass), White wins by two points in the third position using NSSK (assuming area scoring). Black's best response, in terms of maximizing their score, is a pass.|$|E
