In 1990, the MCBT newsletter was transformed into a scientific journal, with an international editorial board and a rigorous peer-review system for the acceptance of technical papers for publication. In 1992, a scientific committee consisting of scientists and trustees was instituted and is charged with directing and coordinating research. In 1993, the bank conducted surveys on wetlands and remote area sensing. This was followed by extensive studies on sea snakes, marine turtles, bats, and other small mammals and studies on herpetofauna, biogeography, resource use, land use, rain-water harvesting and coral reef socioeconomics, in addition to protected area <b>management</b> <b>planning,</b> ecologically suitable <b>management</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{earliest}} American {{forest resource}} <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> {{date to the}} birth of the forestry profession around 1900. For the next half century, these <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> were essentially timber production <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Certainly, other forest values, especially watershed protection, were important parts of the planning. But not until {{the second half of the}} twentieth century did multiple-use and a wide array of forest values become normal components of a forest manage ment plan. Within the last twenty-five years forest <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> have developed a forest stewardship or sustain able forest management foundation. That is, a forest resource <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> is now expected to consider an entire set of forest values, to have a long-term sustainability focus, and to meet a set of expected management and operational criteria. Often, the forest <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> is the basis of a forest certification scheme. The early forest <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> were primarily timber-based and thus had a commercial or financial focus. Today’s forest <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> are based on multiple forest values and may or may not have a financial focus. We contrast the traditional timber manage ment plan with today’s sustainable forest <b>management</b> <b>plan,</b> realizing the basis of both plans is by definition the forest or the timber. Involv ing both timber harvesting activities and the operational foundation of the sustainable forest mana gement plan is essentially a timber <b>management</b> <b>plan.</b> One cannot ignore the fact that all forest <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> ac complish silvicultural objectives via manipulation of timber density variables, like stocking and spacing. Management of a forest still involves timber harvests. Our discussion shows that the timber <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> is still very much alive and forms the basis of modern sustainable forest <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of {{horizontal and vertical}} motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away {{from the direction of}} the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen, which is large (90 x 30km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake Höytiäinen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju esker at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyhäselkä to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource <b>management</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E

This {{was a response to}} alleged acts of corruption carried out by previous ministers. This unprecedented reform was described as part of Regenvanu's ongoing measures against corruption. More generally, his proposals sought to [...] "untangle a whole series of obscure rules on customary landownership", and provide clarity to landowners. The bill based on his proposals was adopted as the Customary Land Management Act in December 2013. Under this law, land ownership is henceforth determined by customary institutions, rather than the ordinary courts. In addition, the Malvatu Mauri (council of chiefs) must be consulted on legislation relating to land.

[...] Among the most important subdivisions of the province are forest regions and forest districts, which have jurisdiction over forests and their management, and also range and grazing leases, and also manage Ministry of Forests recreation sites and campgrounds. [...] Other important subdivisions are Ministry of Environment regions (which controls water rights and management, environmental oversight, pesticide and herbicide permits, the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service and Fish and Wildlife Branch; the provincial parks are managed by a sub-department of the Ministry of Environment, BC Parks), health regions (which administer health funding, hospitals and ambulance services), school districts (whose taxation authority is distinct from that of regional districts and organized by tax assessment areas), and mining districts (whose authority under the Mines Act supersedes nearly all other jurisdictions). [...] The Ministry of Tourism also has a system of tourism regions, and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Small Business Development divides the province into development regions, with BC Stats using a different regionalization system than that of Statistics Canada, which uses regional district boundaries to organize its data. [...] Also very important is a system of Regional <b>Management</b> <b>Planning</b> Boards, which are [...] "roundtable"-type planning authorities on which local stakeholders ranging from taxpayer and industry groups, municipalities and chambers of commerce, Ministry of Forests and Ministry of Environment/BC Parks and in some cases First Nations hammer out long-range plans for regional land-use management.|$|E
