500|$|Before Touraj Moghaddam founded Roksan, he {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the state of}} the audio arts when he heard his little television set reproduce Thelonious Monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system. Through experimentation, he deduced that the existing turntable design failed because the cartridge was not being held still wherever the groove went. He believed that the <b>mean</b> <b>line</b> traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Needing a top plinth roughly an inch (25mm) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800kg/m3, Moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype. His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an investment analyst – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one. They agreed to team up to start production; Roksan Audio was formed. The Xerxes, introduced in 1985, secured the advocacy of Roger Macer, a successful independent hi-fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader, the Linn Sondek. Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of [...] "dozens or more a week" [...] from his customers. The product, named after the Persian king Xerxes I, was launched at a hi-fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled.|$|E
2500|$|In the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (sometimes collectively {{referred}} to as LGC) scripts, one can refer to {{the distance from the}} baseline to the top of regular lowercase glyphs (<b>mean</b> <b>line)</b> as the x-height, and the part of a glyph rising above the x-height as the ascender. [...] The distance from the baseline {{to the top of the}} ascent or a regular uppercase glyphs (cap line) is also known as the cap height. The height of the ascender can have a dramatic effect on the readability and appearance of a font. The ratio between the x-height and the ascent or cap height often serves to characterize typefaces.|$|E
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house <b>mean</b> <b>line.</b> A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

A great many are like it, never thinking what a good thing it would be, instead of going on tacking from side to side between favour and cruelty, to keep to a <b>mean</b> <b>line</b> of common justice. And so we quarrelled, and she, being absolute mistress of all her wealth, destroyed her will that was in my favour, and made another, leaving me nothing but the fag-end of the lease of the town-house and the furniture in it. Then, when we were abroad, she turned to me again, forgave everything, and, becoming ill afterwards, {{wrote a letter to the}} brother, to whom she had left the bulk of her property, stating that I was to have twenty-thousand of the one- hundred-thousand pounds she had bequeathed to him--as in the original will--doing this by letter in case anything should happen to her before a new will could be considered, drawn, and signed, and trusting to his honour quite that he would obey her expressed wish should she die abroad. Well, she did die, in the full persuasion that I was provided for; but her brother (as I secretly expected all the time) refused to be morally bound by a document which had no legal value, and the result is that he has everything, except, of course, the furniture and the lease. It would have been enough to break the heart of a person who had calculated upon getting a fortune, which I never did; for I felt always like an intruder and a bondswoman, and had wished myself out of the Petherwin family a hundred times, with my crust of bread and liberty. For one thing, I was always forbidden to see my relatives, and it pained me much. Now I am going to move for myself, and consider that I have a good chance of success in what I may undertake, because of an indifference I feel about succeeding which gives the necessary coolness that any great task requires.' ...|$|E
