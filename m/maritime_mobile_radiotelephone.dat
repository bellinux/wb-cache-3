5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the situation in}} Europe, receiver licensing in Canada never {{had much to do with}} the funding of broadcasts. Before 1952, Canadian law required the licensing of all radio receivers, not just those for tuning in broadcasts. In 1952 the Radio Act was amended to exempt broadcast-only receivers from licensing, and the Department of Transport (DOT) was given authority to exempt other receiver types from licensing as it saw fit. DOT exempted all [...] "home-type" [...] receivers capable of receiving any radio communications other than [...] "public correspondence" [...] (a term defined as [...] "radio transmissions not intended to be received by just anyone but rather by a member of the public who has paid for the message" [...] - examples include ship-to-shore radiotelephone calls or car-phone transmissions). After 1952, licences were required in Canada only for general coverage shortwave receivers with single-sideband capability, and VHF/UHF scanners which could tune to the <b>maritime</b> or land <b>mobile</b> <b>radiotelephone</b> bands.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the echo}} {{canceling}} for hand-free set <b>mobile</b> <b>radiotelephone</b> or teleconference system, the double-talk is occurred when both the near-end and the far-end speakers talk simultaneously. The conventional adaptive digital FIR filter using algorithm such as LMS fails {{to track the}} echo path in this condition. Because the error signal is contaminated to the near-end signal to estimate the gradient correctly. The Correlation LMS (CLMS) and Extended Correlation LMS (ECLMS) algorithms have been introduced by authors to challenge the double-talk in the echo canceling system. In this {{paper we propose a}} new implementation of ECLMS algorithm in the wavelet domain called wavelet transform extended correlation LMS algorithm (WECLMS) to improve the speed of the convergence. The computer simulation results support the theoretical findings and verify the robustness of the proposed WECLMS algorithm in the double-talk situation...|$|R
