So is a large collection of works from the Northern, North-Eastern and Southern regions of Albania. The elements of the traditional costumes from these regions are distinguished for their level of mastery and finesse, for the richness of the ornaments and symbols merged into geometric, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms.|$|E

The focus {{of this paper is}} to explore transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1997) and its relevance to <b>managing</b> <b>group</b> dynamics in the competitive business environment. In today’s competitive business environment, leaders face a constant struggle of finding innovative and effective ways to improve the performance of their workforce. With companies operating across various geographical locations, and with the collapse of boundaries within the work sphere, the effective use of work groups in the execution of critical tasks continues to provoke great interest. The focus {{of this paper is to}} explore transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1997) and its relevance to <b>managing</b> <b>group</b> dynamics in the competitive business environment. With organizations seeking to strengthen their market share, the focus is not only on acquiring cutting edge technology but also on securing the best talent capable of championing the desired change.

40|$|Patients who sustain facial {{injury and}} who require an {{operation}} {{may be at}} greater risk for developing psychological distress and maladaptive coping. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine psychological responses in adult victims of facial trauma after operation. A consecutive group of adult patients attending specialist outpatient clinics after facial trauma were evaluated for psychological distress. The subjects were divided into two groups based on whether their facial injuries were managed operatively or conservatively. The primary predictor variable in this study was surgical intervention. The main outcome variable was Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Chi-squared, Mann Whitney U-test, and multiple regression analysis were used to analyse data. The sample consisted of 102 subjects; 71 patients had been managed operatively and 31 patients treated non-operatively. Psychometric scores suggestive of anxiety were present in 21 % (n = 15) of the operatively <b>managed</b> <b>group</b> compared with 13 % (n = 4) of the non-operatively <b>managed</b> <b>group</b> of patients. The prevalence of depression was comparable between both groups (14 % compared with 13 %). The median anxiety subscale scores for the operatively <b>managed</b> <b>group</b> when compared with the conservatively <b>managed</b> <b>group</b> of patients were significantly higher (6. 6 compared with 4. 4, p = 0. 02); however, differences in the depression subscale scores did not reach statistical significance (6. 2 compared with 4. 6, p = 0. 06). This study shows an association between anxiety disorders and operative interventions in patients with facial trauma (HADS-A, β = 2. 2, p = 0. 04). Similar rates of depression were found in the surgically and conservatively managed patients...|$|R
