40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to review the past work of vehicle <b>tracking,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and {{alerting}} system, to categorize various methodologies and identify new trends. Vehicle <b>tracking,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and alerting system is challenging problem. There are various challenges encounter in vehicle <b>tracking,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and alerting due to deficiency in proper real time vehicle location and problem of alerting system. GPS (Global Positioning System) is most widely used technology for vehicle tracking and keep regular monitoring of vehicle. The objective of tracking system is to manage and control the transport using GPS transreceiver to know the current location of vehicle. In number of system, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is chosen as one of technology implemented for bus monitoring system.

40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{systems are}} a {{fundamental}} part of railroad safety. With the electrification {{and development of}} train traction control electronics, levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI) close to railroad monitoring systems are reaching critical levels. Unreliable track safety and fault monitoring systems could affect the efficient and safe functioning of railroads and therefore strict demands must be placed on <b>track</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems to ensure electromagnetic compatibility. The Prague subway system is not an exception. An alternative <b>track</b> vibration <b>monitoring</b> system has been proposed, demonstrated and tested along a single railway track in the Prague subway system. Two passive detection systems placed 50 m and 1. 3 km away from the control room were used to measure tunnel vibrations triggered by passing trains free from the effect of any unrelated EMI existing in the subway tunnel. Fibre optic based systems immune to EMI can offer an efficient solution to both <b>track</b> and train <b>monitoring.</b> Web of Science 487 art. no. 35...|$|R

40|$|The Siemens <b>track</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{system is}} being {{developed}} in collaboration with Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) and the Institute of Railway Research at the University of Huddersfield. It makes use of the existing on-board GSM-R cab radio present in every train in the UK, through the fitment of a sensor card, which detects track condition over three axes of train vibrations. By using advanced on-train signal processing, {{only a small amount}} of data to be transferred to the Ground System. For voided switches and crossings (S&C), the GPS location allows the S&C asset number to be identified and reported. This ensures maintenance staff are accurately directed to the location of voids, minimising time spent inspecting and maintaining track and improving safety. The Ground System monitors the voids detected by multiple trains, to increase the reported accuracy (within 5 m) of voids and to reduce false alarms. Automated void reporting, including whether the voids are located at S&C or other track types (such as plain-line track or bridges), allows maintenance to be directed and planned. The Ground System provides advanced warning of track defects, allowing more effective and prioritised preventative maintenance. The real benefit of the <b>track</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is that, by way of a simple activation, it can be present on every train within the UK and therefore be <b>monitoring</b> the <b>track</b> on a large number of train journeys, providing a network-wide <b>track</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. Recent on-train trials have shown that the small low-cost sensor is able to detect voided sleepers underneath both S&C and bridges. The repeatability between trains and for different journeys was found to be excellent. The Network Rail upgrades to the Siemens cab radio, planned for the next 2 - 3 years include a GSM-R/GPS antenna, and the addition of a GPS module to the cab radio, providing a GPS connection in every train. As part of these upgrades Siemens will introduce a the sensor card into the cab radio, minimising installation costs, making it hardware ready for <b>track</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the Siemens implementation of RCM (Remote Condition Monitoring). The only action needed for activation will be the upload of the software application to the cab radio. The <b>track</b> <b>monitoring</b> system allows the network operator to make significant reductions in maintenance and delay costs, line closures, journey re-planning and speed restrictions, by having a reliable monitoring system that is non-intrusive yet gives analysis for the entire rail network, improving train safety, network reliability and passenger comfort...|$|R
