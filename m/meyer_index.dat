40|$|In {{order to}} find the best {{combination}} of materials for reduction gears of marine turbines, the authors carried out an investigation on pitting using a disc machine. The resistance to pitting of wheel material was considerably affected by the work-hardening effect owing to rolling contact. Hard pinion material raised the resistance of wheel material to a great extent. The best result was attained by the combination of materials showing both the greatest work-hardening tendencies. The work-hardening tendency estimated by measuring the <b>Meyer</b> <b>index</b> served to predict the pitting life. The test results were discussed further based upon the theory of elastohydrodynamic lubrication...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{material}} 4 -chloro- 4 -chlorobenzylidene aniline (CCBA) was synthesized and confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectral analyses. CCBA crystal was grown from chloroform by slow evaporation {{at room temperature}} and the single crystal cell parameters were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction method. The perfection of the grown crystal was analyzed by high resolution X-ray diffraction rocking curve analysis. Fluorescence spectrum indicated violet emission at 428 nm. The range of optical absorbance was ascertained by recording UV–vis–NIR spectrum. Load dependant microhardness mea- surements on this crystal revealed the mechanical behavior of the material. Stiffness constant, <b>Meyer</b> <b>index</b> and yield strength of CCBA crystal were calculated. Dielectric {{studies were carried out}} to estimate the dielectric parameters of the grown crystal in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. The thermal behavior of CCBA was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and no phase transition was identified in the temperature region 30 – 100 C. Further, the CCBA crystal was subjected to open aperture Z-scan studies in order to investigate the third order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of CCBA crystal...|$|E
40|$|The Vickers {{hardness}} of CVD SiC ceramics {{is determined}} {{as a function}} of the indentation load. Vickers hardness pyramid-shaped sharp diamond indenter with angle between opposite faces at an angle of 136 ° was used to apply five indentation loads of 4. 91; 9. 81; 29. 43; 49. 05 and 98. 1 N. Care was taken to make indentations only on those areas which had no visible pores. The load was applied at ambient room temperature and dwell time of 15 s. At each indentation load level, 30 perfect indentation were made for CVD SiC ceramics. The results show that the measured hardness depends crucially on the load, which indicates the influence of the indentation size effect (ISE). The load dependence of hardness is analyzed by using the traditional Meyer Law; a proportional specimen resistance (PSR) model and a modified proportional specimen resistance (MPSR) model. The best correlation between measured values and used models is achieved by using the Meyer Law and the modified PSR model. The <b>Meyer</b> <b>index</b> n obtained experimentally is less than 2 (1. 7728), which indicates that hardness is dependent on test loads...|$|E
40|$|Locally {{advanced}} non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (LA-NSCLC) patients have poorer survival and local control with mediastinal node (N 2) tumor involvement at resection. Earlier assessment of nodal burden could inform clinical decision-making prior to surgery. This study evaluated {{the association between}} clinical outcomes and lymph node volume before and after neoadjuvant therapy. CT imaging of patients with operable LA-NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgical resection was assessed. Clinically involved lymph node stations were identified by FDG-PET or mediastinoscopy. Locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan <b>Meier</b> method, concordance <b>index</b> and Cox regression. 73 patients with Stage IIIA-IIIB NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection were identified. The median RT dose was 54 Gy and all patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Involved lymph node volume was significantly associated with LRR and OS but not DM on univariate analysis. Additionally, lymph node volume greater than 10. 6 cm 3 after the completion of preoperative chemoradiation was associated with increased LRR (p< 0. 001) and decreased OS (p = 0. 04). There was no association between nodal volumes and nodal clearance. For patients with LA-NSCLC, large volume nodal disease post-chemoradiation is associated with increased risk of locoregional recurrence and decreased survival. Nodal volume can thus be used to further stratify patients within the heterogeneous Stage IIIA-IIIB population and potentially guide clinical decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{regenerative}} {{potential of}} brain {{has led to}} emerging therapies that can cure clinico-motor deficits after neurological diseases. Bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy is a great hope to mankind as these cells are feasible, multipotent and aid in neurofunctional gains in Stroke patients. Aims: This study evaluates safety, feasibility and efficacy of autologous mononuclear (MNC) stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic ischemic stroke (CIS) using clinical scores and functional imaging (fMRI and DTI). Design: Non randomised controlled observational study Study: Twenty four (n= 24) CIS patients were recruited with the inclusion criteria as: 3 months– 2 years of stroke onset, hand muscle power (MRC grade) at least 2; Brunnstrom stage of recovery: II-IV; NIHSS of 4 - 15, comprehendible. Fugl <b>Meyer,</b> modified Barthel <b>Index</b> (mBI) and functional imaging parameters were used for assessment at baseline, 8 weeks and at 24 weeks. Twelve patients were administered with mean 54. 6 million cells intravenously followed by 8 weeks of physiotherapy. Twelve patients served as controls. All patients were followed up at 24 weeks. Outcomes: The laboratory and radiological outcome measures were within normal limits in MNC group. Only mBI showed statistically significant improvement at 24 weeks (p< 0. 05) whereas the mean FM, MRC, Ashworth tone scores in the MNC group were high as compared to control group. There was an increased number of cluster activation of Brodmann areas BA 4, BA 6 post stem cell infusion compared to controls indicating neural plasticity. Cell therapy is safe and feasible which may facilitate restoration of function in CIS...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of particulate-filled thermoplastic fluoropolymer coatings under both dynamic impact tests and static indentation tests. An instrumented impact testing rig {{was used to measure}} the impact energy, impact velocity, acceleration and impact force during the impact tests. Coating samples with different thicknesses of coating layers and steel substrate were impact tested to investigate the effect of coating and substrate thickness on the impact response and damage to the coatings. The data obtained from the dynamic tests were used to calculate the Meyer hardness values of the coating and compared with the Meyer hardness results obtained from Brinell indentation tests on the coating. The <b>Meyer</b> <b>index</b> m was similar under dynamic impact and static indentation testing conditions. The Meyer hardness calculated from the impact tests does not change markedly as a function of depth of penetration normalised to the thickness of coating, whereas the Brinell hardness increases with the depth of penetration to coating thickness ratio. For a given value of indentation strain, the Meyer hardness calculated from the maximum force measured in the impact test is approximately 2. 5 times that resulting from the Brinell test. This reflects the fact that the higher strain rate in the impact test would give rise to a higher flow stress and thus hardness...|$|E
