40|$|The need {{to measure}} flow rates in fluids is {{large in the}} world today. Many are the {{applications}} where {{a more or less}} accurate measurement is needed, e. g. gasoline pipe, district heating, medical flows and flows in the manufacturing industry. One way to measure flow velocities that is commonly used is with vortex shedding flow meters. These flow meters detect the vortices behind a bluff body in a flow in different ways, one way is by transit time ultrasonics. Since, normally, the sing around-ultrasonic is a more accurate way to measure flow velocity the theory behind this thesis is that a vortex shedder flow meter with sing-around ultrasonics should be more accurate than the ones with transit-time. A vortex flow meter is modeled with FEMLAB to give simulated data for the signal processing, and then the data is processed in MATLAB. The zero-crossing algorithm and the fast Fourier transform are applied to find the vortex frequency. In this stage {{it seems as if the}} sampling frequency is too small to detect the vortex frequencies. The final step is to make a vortex flow meter to confirm the theoretical model. The bluff body is built around ultrasonic transducers from D-flow technology AB. The flow <b>meter</b> is <b>inserted</b> to the water laboratory at Luleå University of Technology and measurements are done that is later evaluated and compared to the simulation results. In the real model the vortex frequency is discovered for the lower velocities, but the signal processing used in this thesis is not sufficient to give accurate frequencies for the higher velocities. Two big conclusions are made, that the theoretical model is not good enough and that the vortex frequency is present in the measured signal but could not be found with the algorithms at hand.

After stabilization of hemodynamics, α-hANP (0. 1 μg/kg or 2. 5 μg/kg) was given via the cubital vein into the animals. Results were as follows : heart rate (HR) did not change remarkably, mean aortic blood pressure (MBP) was remarkably reduced in both groups after high dose treatment. The degree of change was significantly greater in the hypertensive group than in the normotensive group. Cardiac output (CO) initially increased and decreased slowly after high dose treatment. Renal blood pressure (RBP) was reduced significantly in both groups after high dose treatment. Renal blood flow (RBF) increased significantly in the hypertensive group after high dose treatment. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary volume (UV) increased in both groups, but the degree of change was greater in the hypertensive group than in the normotensive group upon high dose treatment. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosteron concentration (ALD) decreased effectively upon high dose treatment. In the hypertensive group, renal cortical blood flow increased effectively, but otherwise in normotensive group. The increase of CBF upon high dose treatment seems to be associated with reduced PRA.

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{management}} and to better locate water losses, Water Distribution Networks can be physically divided into District <b>Meter</b> Areas (DMAs), <b>inserting</b> hydraulic devices on proper pipes and thus simplifying the control of water budget and pressure regime. Traditionally, the water network division is based on empirical suggestions and on ‘trial and error’ approaches, checking results step by step through hydraulic simulation, and so making {{it very difficult to}} apply such approaches to large networks. Recently, some heuristic procedures, based on graph and network theory, have shown {{that it is possible to}} automatically identify optimal solutions in terms of number, shape and dimension of DMAs. In this paper, weighted spectral clustering methods have been used to define the optimal layout of districts in a real water distribution system, taking into account both geometric and hydraulic features, through weighted adjacency matrices. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the use of spectral clustering to address the arduous problem of water supply network partitioning with an elegant mathematical approach compared to other heuristic procedures proposed in the literature. A comparison between different spectral clustering solutions has been carried out through topological and energy performance indices, in order to identify the optimal water network partitioning procedure.|$|R
40|$|Microfin tubes {{have already}} been widely used for {{air-conditioning}} and refrigeration applications as they ensure a large heat transfer enhancement with a relatively low pressure drop increase. During condensation microfin tubes show a heat transfer enhancement, compared to equivalent smooth tubes under the same operating conditions, that {{is partly due to}} the mere increase in the effective exchange area, and additionally to the turbulence induced in the liquid film by the micro fins and to the surface tension effect on the liquid drainage. The performances of these microfin tubes during condensation of refrigerants have been studied experimentally and theoretically. In this work the authors present their own data when condensing R- 134 a inside two different tubes: a 9. 5 mm outer diameter microfin tube (7. 69 mm inside diameter at the fin tip and 60 fins with 0. 23 mm fin height and 13 ° helix angle) and a plain 8 mm inner diameter tube. Many authors use the so-called Wilson-plot method to measure the heat transfer coefficient of tubes; here, the experimental data have been taken by direct measurement of the wall temperature {{in a wide range of}} operative conditions: mass velocities ranging from 100 to 800 kg/(m 2 s) and vapour quality from 20 to 80 %; saturation temperature was kept constant at 40 °C. The experimental tests were run in a new test section set up at the Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova. The test section is a counter flow tube-in-tube condenser, with the refrigerant condensing in the inner tube, against the cold water flowing in the annulus. The measuring sections are 300 mm long and they are instrumented with thermocouples embedded in the tube wall, in the middle of the tube for the microfin tube and at inlet and outlet for the smooth tube. The thermocouples are soldered along the circumference to draw a cross shape. Refrigerant temperatures at inlet and outlet of the test section are measured by means of adiabatic sections, using thermocouples inserted into both the refrigerant flow and the tube wall. The refrigerant flow can be independently controlled by a variable speed gear pump. Two digital strain gauge pressure (absolute and differential) transducers are connected to manometric taps to measure the refrigerant pressure upstream and downstream of the test tube. The refrigerant mass flow rate is measured by a Coriolis effect mass flow <b>meter</b> <b>inserted</b> downstream of the pump. The cooling water flow rate is measured by a magnetic flow meter and its temperature gain across the instrumented test tube is measured with a copper-constantan thermopile, installed into mixing chambers to assure perfect mixing of the water. There is agreement in the literature that the mechanisms of heat transfer and pressure drop are intimately linked with the prevailing two-phase flow regime. During condensation inside horizontal tubes, the two-phase flow may be dominated by vapour shear or gravity forces. While annular flow pattern is associated with high vapour shear, stratified, wavy and slug flows appear when gravity is the controlling force. In a fully developed annular flow pattern, there is a thin condensate film on the entire tube wall, while the gas phase flows in the central core, and heat transfer is governed by vapour shear and turbulence. Very poor evidence about the effect of microfins on the flow patterns during condensation is given in the open literature. Thus, to investigate the two phase flow pattern during condensation a new test section was built up; it consists of a large brass chamber equipped with three glass windows expressly designed to light and to observe the fluid. The test tube ends up in the chamber, in this way the fluid outlet pattern can be analyzed and recorded with a high shutter digital video camera. The same operative conditions set for heat transfer coefficient measurements are reproduced in the visualization section in order to investigate the specific flow pattern at the outlet vapour quality. For the study of the main flow patterns, in particular focusing on the stratified/annular mode transition, the visualization experimental data are analysed with reference to parameters like dimensionless vapour velocity, Martinelli parameter and void fraction, that are adopted in the main available flow pattern maps. The aim of this work is to link the heat transfer coefficients and in particular the heat transfer enhancement of the microfin tube with the flow pattern during the process. Microfin tube shows different heat transfer enhancement with different mass velocities. Since the available maps are designed only for smooth tubes, the results of this experimental work could be used as a starting point for drawing a new flow pattern map specifically dedicated to enhanced tubes...|$|R

In {{the present}} {{investigation}} we proposed the study of possible pulp damaged produced {{as a result of}} the application of an ultrasound scaler with 29 KHz output, commonly used in clinical vetereinary odontology. As an initial hypothesis, and based on bibliographic research, we considered that an application of more than 15 seconds, with maximun Coolant, meant a risk of dental pulp damage as a consequence of the rise in temperature produced by the vibration of the end of the ultrasound probe. The method applied consisted of a series of previous measurements on experimental animals and finally on a group of six animals and one control animal. In each animal we used exclusivaly maxillary and mandibular premolars to which was applied double, four times and six times the recommended time, without the use of a coolant. At the same time temperatures were taken of the pulp canal the ambient temperature, the cheek, the gingival canal and the dentine of the affected tooth, using a probe with a termistor attached to a resistivity <b>meter</b> and <b>inserted</b> in the dentine to a depth of 1 mm. Other data was also obtained on the thickness of the dentine and pulp cavity Once the colletion of data referring to the highest temperatures generated was complete, a waiting period of 2 weeks followed, after which a significant sample of dental pieces was removed for a histological study. In the control animal the temperature was raised to a limit of between 45 ºC and 47 ºC. Following this, all the premolars were removed for a histological stydy. The results obtained make us conclude that the application of an ultrasound scaler of 29 KHz during 90 seconds continuous use on the dental surface, without coolant, does not incresease the tooth temperature. However, it can provoke damage comparable with acute pulpitis, as a consequece of the sonic effect caseded, very similar to the effects produced by the heat applied in the control animal...|$|R

The effect of hydrogel amendment to the upper sand soil layer on water infiltration into the lower un-amended sand layer, irrigation frequency, water use efficiency and biomass production of Agrostis stolonifera was investigated. The upper 25 cm sand layer in three identical buckets was amended at 0. 4 %, 0. 2 % and a control (no hydrogel) while the lower 25 cm sand layer separated from the upper layer by a wire mesh in the same buckets was un-amended. Agrostis stolonifera seeds were sown in each bucket and adequately irrigated using a hand sprayer. Potential <b>meter</b> electrodes were <b>inserted</b> at three random positions in each of the buckets and subsequent irrigations were done when a pressure of 600 bars was recorded in any of the three treatments. Data were collected on irrigation frequency, water content in the lower layer, water use efficiency and biomass production of Agrostis stolonifera. The mean {{water potential}} in the lower 25 cm layer un-amended sand was significantly more negative in the 0. 4 % hydrogel than in the control. More water content (10 %) was recorded in the lower layer under the control bucket than in either the 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % hydrogel amended buckets. The frequency of irrigation was three-fold in the control compared to the 0. 4 % hydrogel amended sand. The hydrogel amended sand significantly increased the shoot and root biomass of Agrostis stolonifera by 2. 2 and 4 times respectively compared to the control. The 0. 4 % hydrogel amendment in sand increased the water use efficiency of grass eight fold with respect to the control. The hydrogel stimulated development of a dense root network and root aggregation that increased contact of the roots with moisture thus improving water use efficiency of hydrogel amended soil. The results suggest that hydrogels can improve sandy soil properties for plant growth by absorbing and keeping water longer in the soil matrix thus reducing watering frequency...|$|R
40|$|Within water {{distribution}} networks sectioning valves {{are widely used}} in order to regulate the flow and to operate on the pipelines. The most of the sectioning valves are quite old {{and have to be}} operated manually. Because {{of the cost of the}} measuring devices, flow and pressure meters are only marginally used within the network. Finally, fisical and chemical parameters of the water are generally measured only at the network intake. As a consequence, the knowledge of the networks’ status is rather poor and, in many cases, the response of the technical management to anomalies is very slow. Another problem coming form the lack of knowledge is connected to leak detection. In order to asses the amount of leaching, the balance between the volume of water supplied to the network and the total volume distributed to the users has to be performed over large areas. Therefore, the exact location of leaching is possible only whenever large volumes of water are lost. The new device is designed to attain different goals: transform a traditional gate valve in a monitoring and sectioning valve; obtain an easy access to the pipeline without necessity of flow shut down; perform real time remote control in several point of the network. The proposed machine differs from the already known system for measuring and sectioning pipelines within networks for fluid transportation because of its unique configuration, allowing a low cost and easy solution for using different measuring and sectionig devices in the same point of a the pipe. Patents are pending on the machinary and on most application thereof. The new monitoring and sectioning device can be used in almost all cases where flow, pressure or chemical parameters of fluid have to be measurered, or flow regulation is required. The new valve can handle, alternatively, the following situations: -flow regulation along water supply pipelines. Flow regulation can be operated manually or automatically by remote control. -automatic closure of the pipeline in presence of anomaluous water quality parameters; -automatic closure of the pipeline in presence of pipeline failure; -flow rate measurement. A large size flow <b>meter</b> can be <b>inserted</b> in the pipeline without flow shut down. -pressure measurement.

Frequently, {{these problems are}} attributed to learned behavioral patterns, but {{little is known about}} organic causes of sleep disturbances in children. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common cause of sleep disordered breathing in adults. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is also common in this population. Less is known about OSA and GER as potential causative agents of sleep disturbances in children, and these medical problems have not been addressed in Icelandic children. This study was designed to investigate the organic causes of sleep disordered breathing in Icelandic children, evaluate their severity and possible therapies. Material and methods: One hundred and ninty children who were referred to the Pediatric Department at Reykjavik Hospital due to sleep disturbances were hospitalized over night and a sleep study was recorded, using the sleep equipment, EMBLA. The latter machine has 16 channels that record informations about sleep patterns and breathing. The children were 0 - 18 years of age. Informations were collected from EEGs, EMGs, and eye movements to determine sleep stages, and with respiratory belts with sensors on the chest and abdomen as well as an air-flow sensor that measures airflow through the nose and mouth. When GER was suspected, a pH <b>meter</b> was <b>inserted</b> and the pH values were measured in the upper and lower parts of the esophagus. Results: The results demonstrate {{that a large number of}} children who suffer from sleep disturbances have an underlying disease. Of 61 children who underwent a sleep study and were suspected to have OSA, 46 had a positive study that resulted in a change in therapy. In addition, 69 of 89 children who underwent pH measurements in the esophagus were diagnosed with GER which prompted changes in therapy. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that both OSA and GER are common problems in children with sleep disturbances. We conclude that sleep studies are important in the overall workup of children with sleep disturbances, and can provide valuable informations regarding the causes, prevalence and severity of these medical problems. Sleep studies also facilitate the selection of children who require specific treatments such as operation of the oropharynx or CPAP/BiPAP treatment for OSA, or drug therapy for GER.

Markmið rannsóknarinnar var að leita að vefrænum orsökum svefnraskana hjá íslenskum börnum og meta alvarleika þeirra og meðferðarmöguleika. Efniviður og aðferðir: Eitt hundrað og níutíu börnum sem leitað var með til barnadeildar Sjúkrahúss Reykjavíkur (nú Landspítala Fossvogi) vegna svefntruflana voru lögð inn á barnadeild Sjúkrahúss Reykjavíkur yfir nótt og var svefnmunstur þeirra skráð með svefnrannsóknartækinu EMBLA. Tækið hefur 16 rásir sem safna upplýsingum um svefnmunstur og öndunarhreyfingar barnsins. Börnin voru á aldrinum 0 - 18 ára.

40|$|Thermal energy {{consumption}} in buildings with chilled or hot water distribution systems is often monitored {{through the use}} of some type of flow metering device. These flowmeters can be fixed types, such as venturis or orifices, or insertion flowmeters which can be more easily installed and removed. The easy removal and reinstallation of the insertion type flowmeters makes them good choices for use in existing buildings or in retrofit projects. Besides the installation benefits, insertion flowmeters can also be installed while the pipe is in service or ''hot tapped". With any type flowmeter however, location in the pipe is a critical problem and deserves special consideration. Ideally, the <b>meter</b> should be <b>inserted</b> in existing pipe with a minimum of 10 to 15 diameters of straight pipe upstream of the meter location. This is rarely the case in existing piping distribution systems. It is much more common to be faced with only one or two candidate metering locations and these often are very short straight runs or will have elbows upstream and downstream of the proposed metering location. This paper reports on flow measurement error resulting from an insertion flowmeter installed downstream of a 90 ? elbow. The measurement errors were compared for tests conducted in 4. 0 and 6. 0 inch (0. 1 and 0. 15 meter) diameter PVC pipe. The insertion flowmeter was a nonmagnetic, tangential paddle wheel type. The flowmeter was located from 2 to 10 pipe diameters downstream fiom a 90 ? elbow with fluid velocities ranging from 1. 0 to 10. 0 ft/s (0. 3 to 3. 0 m/s). At each flowmeter location, the meter was rotated in 45 ? increments around the circumference of the pipe to quantify the effect of circumferential location on flow error. The flowmeters were tested at the energy metering calibration facility at the Texas A&M University Energy Systems Laboratory Riverside campus. Flowmeter output was compared to mass flow measurements obtained 6 om precision load cells mounted beneath a 1342 ft^ 3 (38 m^ 3) weigh tank. All output is given in terms of percent error relative to the load cells. Final results are presented as a bction of flowmeter downstream location, circumferential rotation angle, and fluid velocity. Circumferential meter location was found to be a very important factor. The percent difference for the tested flow meters ranged 6 om - 23 % to - 5 % in the 4. 0 in. (0. 1 m) pipe and 6 om - 33 % to 1 % in the 6. 0 in. (0. 15 m) pipe.
