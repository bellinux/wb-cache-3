50|$|A {{high forest}} canopy and limited scrub were {{originally}} {{considered to be}} the best conditions to support and to spread the <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily.</b> The management programme now looks to release the derelict coppice by removal of the crowded Corsican pines. Lily Beetle and browsing Fallow Deer have been noted as the biggest hindrance to <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily,</b> which despite this, is still found in good numbers.|$|E
50|$|Lilium martagon (<b>martagon</b> <b>lily</b> or Turk's cap lily) is a Eurasian {{species of}} lily. It has a {{widespread}} native region extending from Portugal east through Europe and Asia as far east as Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the most}} {{valuable}} habitats in the Rhön are the mountain meadows and fields of mat grass (Nardetum strictae) on the higher slopes. Characteristic plants here include the monkshood, northern wolfsbane, common moonwort, <b>martagon</b> <b>lily,</b> greater butterfly orchid, perennial cornflower and wig knapweed.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} on the Hainleite is characterised by {{mixed woods}} and, {{especially in the}} east, by dense beech forest. The undergrowth below the trees is dominated by Perlgras and <b>Martagon</b> <b>lilies.</b> Species of orchid abound on the open Muschelkalk slopes.|$|R

5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, <b>martagon</b> <b>lilies,</b> and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|R
50|$|Important endemic {{plants in}} the area are the Carpathian {{harebell}} (Campanula carpatica), Pulsatilla slavica, Hesperis silvestris, Liguria sibirica, and Saxifraga paniculate. Other plants found in this area are the mountain tassel flower (Soldanella montana), <b>martagon</b> <b>lily</b> (Lilium martagon), and variegated monk's hood (Aconitum variegatum).|$|E
50|$|The site is {{considered}} to be the best site in the county for the <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily,</b> which is a naturalised plant and is uncommon in Gloucestershire. The plant grows throughout the reserve and is mentioned in the Natural England citation for Shorn Cliff and Caswell Woods.|$|E
50|$|Lilium pyrenaicum (Pyrenean Lily, Yellow Turk's-cap Lily, Yellow <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily)</b> is {{native to}} montane regions, mainly the Pyrenees, from Spain and eastwards, with the range {{extending}} into the Caucasus. It grows up to 1.3m high. It bears up to 12 Turks-cap shaped flowers. These are yellow, orange or red, and unpleasantly scented.|$|E
50|$|The local {{specific}} environment creates favorable {{conditions for}} the existence and development {{of a number of}} endangered plant species. The major species found there are: polypodim (Polypodium interjectum) - highly endangered C2 species, <b>Martagon</b> <b>lily</b> (Lilium martagon) - C4 species requiring attention, hairy brome (Bromus ramosus) - endangered C3 species, and the bright chervil (Anthriscus nitida).|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} the nationally rare Wood Fescue and Narrow-leaved Bitter-cress. Local rarities include Wood-rush (Luzula forsteri), Wild Madder, Lily-of-the-valley and Tutsan. <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily</b> is supported in adjacent woodland (Lippets Grove), {{which is a}} Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserve {{about half a mile}} south of Brockweir, and is leased from the Forestry Commission. The Grove is accessed along Offa's Dyke Path.|$|E
5000|$|The {{richness}} of the reserve is demonstrated by the recorded species which include Columbine, Greater Butterfly-orchid, Wood Anemone, Bluebell, Yellow Archangel, Primrose, Early Purple Orchid, Cowslip and the Early Dog-violet in the spring. Summer species include Common Milkwort, Oxeye Daisy, Common Knapweed and the Bulbous Buttercup. Also recorded are Foxglove, Rosebay Willowherb and flowerings of the rare <b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily.</b> Ferns grow between the stones such as Black Spleenwort and Hart's-tongue Fern.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} plants of {{particular}} interest {{can be found at}} Iford: standard Wisteria sinensis blossoms across much of {{the front of the house}} and up flights of steps linking the terraces (particularly good in late May); Phillyrea latifolia; Buxus sempervirens grows in wild tree form in the woods above the house and is extensively used in the gardens as a structural plant; Cupressus sempervirens; Hemerocallis citrina, the scented daylily; the naturalised <b>Martagon</b> <b>lily.</b>|$|E
50|$|Montane {{ecosystems}} are diverse and include several plant communities: forests, shrubs, meadows, pastures and peatlands. There are six different vegetation {{zone in the}} park. Oak, beech, spruce, subalpine zone of the shrub vegetation of common horsetail, blueberry, subalpine spruce and mugo pine. Other plants include shrub alder, steppe pedunculate oak, but also rare and endangered species like European pasqueflower, yellow pheasant's eye, Kosovo peony, common sundew, Heldreich's maple, <b>martagon</b> <b>lily,</b> pygmy iris and marsh orchid.|$|E
50|$|In {{the higher}} levels grow {{mountain}} arnica and maiden pinks, and in the valley areas western marsh orchids and early purple orchids. Near the Jägersburg near Odershausen are found a few rare dwarf beeches. In cool and damp stream dales grows the rare, highly poisonous common monkshood. In light beech and oak forests with limy subsoil is found the <b>martagon</b> <b>lily.</b> In a few places are found great stands of the rare wild daffodil.|$|E
50|$|Avala {{is known}} for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are {{protected}} by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of laburnum, box tree, black broom, common holly and <b>martagon</b> <b>lily.</b> The area is also abundant in medical herbs, like the early-purple orchid and belladonna. Almost 70% of Avala is forested. High woods mostly consist of durmast oak, Turkey oak, hornbeam, beech, linden, black pine, black locust and other trees.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the holm oak, the Mediterranean olive tree, rhododendrons, firs, spruces, Swiss pines and above all larches, the Mercantour is also endowed with more than 2,000 species of flowering plants, 200 of which are very rare: edelweiss and <b>martagon</b> <b>lily</b> are the best known, {{but there is also}} saxifrage with multiple flowers, houseleek, moss campion and gentian offering a multi-coloured palette in the spring. The Mercantour is the site of a large-scale All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory and Monitoring programme to identify all its living species, organised by the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy (EDIT).|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with other}} low {{mountain}} regions, the Rhön is particularly rich in plant varieties. Its natural vegetation {{would probably be}} dominated by beech woods with scattered groups of other trees, but today beech trees are very much in decline. A few of these ancient woods were identified as core elements of the Rhön biosphere reserve. The higher beech woods are a habitat for rare, sometimes isolated, species of plant such as the Alpine blue-sow-thistle, giant bellflower and annual honesty. The vegetation of the lower-lying beech woods has a mix of mountain and other varieties. In addition to common wildflowers like the <b>martagon</b> <b>lily,</b> lily of the valley, wild chervil and wild garlic, various orchids also flourish here including Cephalanthera orchids, the yellow coralroot, bird's-nest orchid, lady's slipper and lady orchid.|$|E
40|$|Protected areas, {{which now}} cover 11 % of the earth's surface (Rodrigues et al., 2004), {{play a vital}} role in tourism and they are being visited by more and more people (Buckley, 2003). These areas have been {{declared}} to protect species and habitats from being disturbed by visitors and from habit degradation (Kelly et al., 2002; Boo, 1990). This thesis deals with the monitoring and evaluation of tourism impact of illegal traffic to the National Nature Reserve Vůznice. In this study I have focused on three main units: firstly the vegetation - we mapped the specially protected plant species and habitats assessed valuables in ArcGIS, secondly the evaluation of the impact on bird and finally the monitoring of tourism. Valuable habitat is mixed and very valuable habitats are mainly located in the valley of NPR Vůznice, including roadsides. In contrast, less valuable habitats are spread irregularly. I found 11 kinds of plants protected by law while monitoring endangered plants in the area. Among specially protected species in the area surrounding roads are spring snowflake Leucojum vernum (Spring Snowflake), Lunaria Rediviva (Perennial Honesty), Lilium martagon (<b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily)</b> and a greater proportion of important species is located off roads on slopes, e. g. Aurinia saxatilis (Basket of Gold), Dictamnus [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When was the Turk's-cap Lily (<b>Martagon</b> <b>Lily)</b> {{introduced}} to Sweden? In the Swedish Middle Ages or 500 years later, during The Swedish Great Power period? This dissertation contests the widely held position, known as kompendietraditionen, {{according to which}} the Turk's-cap Lily was {{introduced to}} Sweden in the Middle Ages. It conducts a thor-ough examination of (primarily written) Swedish botanical and horticultural sources from the Middle Ages to the final decades of the 18 th century. Its main focus is on Sweden, parallel sources from the other Nordic and relevant European countries, such as England, the Netherlands and Germany, are also analysed in some depth. The investigation examines Turk's-cap Lily’s name history, especially the names lilium and martagon. From antiquity up to Linné’s binary nomenclature and his binary designation: Lilium martagon, the early-scientific names and phrase epithets of the species are analysed together with all the early Swedish names. A {{significant part of the}} thesis is devoted to the analysis of the diffi-culties surrounding correspondences in history between names and actually living plants. Based on documentary evidence, the Turk's-cap Lily’s early history is reconstructed for Swe-den and the other Nordic countries. Our findings show that the first Turk's-cap Lily of the North blossomed in Bergen, Norway, 1597. Introductions of the Turk's-cap Lily in gardens in England and on the Continent were exam-ined for the purpose of putting the history of introduction in Sweden into context. The systematic categorisation and development of the Turk's-cap Lily in relation to the other European lily spe-cies, including their morphological, ecological and genetic conditions, is treated from a historical point of view. A collection of fourteen supplements enlarges and illustrates different aspects of the investigation, such as for instance a supplement about “lillies in the Bible”. The main result of the dissertation is that the Turk's-cap Lily was introduced to Sweden dur-ing {{the first half of the}} 17 th century. The result is confirmed by investigations of the circumstances in the other Nordic countries. The monograph is richly illustrated; some of the old dawings are published for the first time...|$|E
