5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species <b>mimics</b> {{the appearance}} of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian <b>mimics.</b> Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus <b>mimics</b> a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, <b>mimics</b> with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, <b>mimics</b> are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect <b>mimics</b> more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian <b>mimics</b> to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

Our analysis contains a cross-sectional regression approach, a time-series regression approach and a portfolio approach for constructing factor <b>mimicking</b> portfolios. The focus of the analysis {{is the power of}} <b>mimicking</b> portfolios in the asset pricing models. We conclude that the time series regression approach, with the book-to-market sorted portfolios as the base assets, is the most proper alternative to construct <b>mimicking</b> portfolios for factors for which a time-series of factor realisation is available. To construct <b>mimicking</b> portfolios based on the firm characteristics we suggest a loading weighted portfolio approach. <b>mimicking</b> portfolio; asset pricing; cross-sectional regression approach; time series regression approach...|$|R
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar <b>mimics</b> a twig, or a grasshopper <b>mimics</b> a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female <b>mimics</b> a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself <b>mimics</b> the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that <b>mimics</b> are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive <b>mimics,</b> nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of specific <b>mimic</b> peptides targeting duck hepatitis B virus polymerase (DHBVP) on duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) replication in primary duck hepatocytes. Phage display technology (PDT) was used to screen for <b>mimic</b> peptides specifically targeting DHBVP and the associated coding sequences were determined using DNA sequencing. The selected <b>mimic</b> peptides were then used to treat primary duck hepatocytes infected with DHBV in vitro. Infected hepa-tocytes expressing the <b>mimic</b> peptides intracellularly were also prepared. The cells were divided into <b>mimic</b> peptide groups (EXP groups), an entecavir-treated group (positive control) and a negative control group. The medium was changed every 48 h. Following a 10 ‑day incubation, the cell supernatants were collected. DHBV‑DNA in the cellular nucleus, cytoplasm and culture supernatant was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight <b>mimic</b> peptides were selected following three PDT screening rounds for investigation in the DHBV‑infected primary duck hepatocytes. The qPCR results showed that following direct treatment with <b>mimic</b> peptide 2 or 7, intracellular expression of <b>mimic</b> peptide 2 or 7, or treatment with entecavir, the DHBV-DNA levels in the culture supernatant and cytoplasm of duck hepatocytes were significantly lower than those in the negative control (P< 0. 05). The cytoplasmic DHBV‑DNA content of the cells treated with <b>mimic</b> peptide 7 was lower than that in the other groups (P< 0. 05). In addition, the DHBV-DNA content of the nuclear fractions following the intracellular expression of <b>mimic</b> peptide 7 was significantly lower than that in the other groups (P< 0. 05). <b>Mimic</b> peptides specifically targeting DHBVP, administered directly or expressed intracellularly, can significantly inhibit DHBV replication in vitro...|$|R
