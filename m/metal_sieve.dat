40|$|Abstract Fasciola hepatica is a {{parasite}} {{that affects the}} hepatic ducts of several species of domestic and wild vertebrates, causing huge economic losses to livestock rearing worldwide. Reports on occurrences of F. hepatica in capybaras are an important epidemiological aspect of this disease, since these rodents can {{be a source of}} contamination for other animals and humans. In the present study, conducted in a rural area of the municipality of Confins, Minas Gerais, fresh feces from capybaras were collected from the ground near a lagoon {{at the edge of the}} Ribeirão da Mata river. These were examined using the technique of four <b>metal</b> <b>sieves.</b> F. hepatica eggs were recovered. This trematode species was confirmed by observing morphological characteristics and measuring the eggs recovered from the capybara feces, and through experimental infection of Lymnaea columella (Say, 1817) by miracidia from these eggs and subsequent infection of C 57 /BL 06 mice with metacercariae originating from these infected mollusks. The data suggest the occurrence of natural cycle of F. hepatica in this region and provide a warning that expansion of the geographical distribution of this parasite by means of this rodent is possible. It is therefore important to adopting measures for epidemiological control of this helminthiasis...|$|R

The techniques {{that are able to}} produce emulsions in larger amounts do not usually produce monodispersed droplets. We here report on a specific technique that has the potential to combine the best of both worlds: premix emulsification using a packed bed of differently sized glass beads (55, 65, 78 and 90 mm) supported by a <b>metal</b> <b>sieve.</b> The production of oil-in-water emulsions was targeted, and the process conditions especially related to internal structure of the porous media like interstitial void size and bed height were investigated. The Reynolds number, Re, was used to characterize the flow inside the packed bed consisting of asymmetric pores following a tortuous path inside the porous media. The void size and the flow velocity determined the droplet break-up. Two droplet break-up mechanisms were identified: either dominated by constriction (Reo 40) or inertia (Re 440). Droplets below 5 mm (droplet to void size ratioE 0. 2) could easily be produced; having relatively narrow droplet size distribution (droplet spanE 0. 75).

In {{this study we}} investigate the effects of different processing techniques on dinoflagellate cyst concentrations using well-mixed sediment samples from Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. At the onset of any dinoflagellate cyst investigation, we suggest following the recommendations of Maher (1981) to experimentally adjust the sample size to obtain a ratio close to ~ 2 of dinoflagellate cysts counted to Lycopodium spores counted, {{in order to obtain}} reproducible concentrations. Results further show that both oven-drying at ~ 45 °C and freeze-drying are viable, non-destructive techniques yielding reproducible results. Use of warm HCl (40 – 60 °C) for a short time (30 min) is harmless, whereas treatment with warm HF (40 – 60 °C) affects the reproducibility of the concentrations. Pre-sieving can result in loss of cysts and/or spike but this can be easily monitored by checking the residue. Perforated <b>metal</b> <b>sieves</b> show more consistent results than the Nitex nylon meshes. The use of 30 second sonication does not affect the reproducibility, and is advised to remove amorphous organic matter. Adding the Lycopodium spike at the end of preparation yields consistently lower concentrations, which were usually not reproducible, suggesting noticeable losses of Lycopodium spores during processing if the Lycopodium spores are added at the beginning. This method can be considered a viable alternative, but the discrepancy should be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|The {{comet assay}} {{is widely used}} {{nowadays}} as its main applications include genotoxicity testing, human biomonitoring, DNA repair studies, environmental biomonitoring and clinical studies. It appeals to researchers because of its simplicity, sensitivity, and versatility. Both the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have included the in vivo comet assay in their step-wise approach for genotoxicity testing. Furthermore, last year the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finally adopted the guideline {{to carry out the}} in vivo mammalian alkaline comet assay in fresh tissue. Although the OECD Guideline takes into account the possibility of freezing tissues or cell nuclei for later analysis, the laboratory should demonstrate competency in freezing methodologies and confirm low ranges of % tail DNA in target tissues of vehicle treated animals, and that positive responses can still be detected. Freezing procedures for tissues have been described in the literature using different methods, but there is currently no agreement on how to best freeze and thaw tissues. The possibility of freezing the samples may be very helpful when handling too many samples, to integrate the comet assay with other toxicological studies, or to combine its endpoint with other genotoxicity endpoints. Therefore our aim was to test different methods for freezing liver samples, {{in order to be able}} to store the samples for later alkaline comet assay analysis. Liver pieces were obtained directly at necropsy and 4 different procedures were followed to freeze them: 1. - flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at - 80 °C; 2. - flash frozing in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and storage at - 80 °C; 3. - immersion in RNA later® solution at 4 °C overnight and storage at - 80 °C; 4. - immersion in Merchant buffer at 4 °C overnight and storage at - 80 °C. Besides, we also tried cutting the tissue and homogenizing it using a <b>metal</b> <b>sieve,</b> and storing the resulting cell suspension at - 80 °C both with and without using Mr. Frosty™, before and after filtering through a 100 μM nylon filter and centrifuging it.

Open thyroid follicles {{were used to}} prepared a crude particulate fraction, which contained lysosomes, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. These organelles were subfractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on iso-osmotic Percoll gradients. A lysosomal peak was identified by its content of acid hydrolases: acid phosphatase, cathepsin D, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase. The lysosomal peak was well separated from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The lysosomal peak, from which Percoll was removed by centrifugation, was taken as the purified lysosome fraction (L). Lysosomes of fraction L were purified 45 - 55 -fold (as compared with the homogenate) and contained about 5 % of the total thyroid acid hydrolase activities. Electron microscopy showed that fraction L was composed of an approx. 90 % pure population of lysosomes, with an average diameter of 220 nm. Acid hydrolase activities were almost completely (80 - 90 %) released by an osmotic-pressure-dependent lysis. Thyroglobulin was identified by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis as a soluble component of the lysosome fraction. In conclusion, a 50 -fold purification of pig thyroid lysosomes was achieved by using a new tissue-disruption procedure and isopycnic centrifugation on Percoll gradient. The presence of thyroglobulin indicates that the lysosome population is probably composed of primary and secondary lysosomes. Isolated thyroid lysosomes should serve as an interesting model to study the reactions whereby thyroid hormones are generated from thyroglobulin and released into the thyroid cells...|$|E

This thesis {{is dedicated to the}} {{preparation of}} <b>metal</b> containing molecular <b>sieve</b> macrostructures (modified macrostructures). Modified molecular sieve macrostructures were prepared by the resin templating method. Firstly, molecular sieves were synthesized within the pore structure of macroporous anion exchange resin beads. After this step, a certain degree of ion exchange capacity is retained by the resin facilitating the secondary insertion of metal anions. Metal anionic species were ion exchanged into the resin-molecular sieve composites obtained in a following step. Finally, the resin was removed by calcination leaving behind self-bonded <b>metal</b> containing molecular <b>sieve</b> spheres with a shape and size similar to the original resin beads. V, W, Cr and Pd containing macrostructures were prepared by the method. Resin-silica composites, in which the structure of the silica was changed from amorphous to crystalline silicalite- 1 were used for the preparation of the V and W spheres. The Cr and Pd containing spheres were prepared from resin-zeolite beta composites.

40|$|The work {{presented}} concerns {{synthesis of}} structured molecular sieves. The preparation procedure {{is based on}} the use of ion exchange resins as macrotemplates. Macroporous cation or anion exchange resin types were used depending on the molecular sieve type to be synthesized. Anion exchange resin beads were employed as macrotemplates in the synthesis of zeolite type molecular sieves since negatively charged precursor species are present in the initial zeolite synthesis solutions. Cation exchange resins were used for the preparation of aluminophosphate molecular sieves, where precursor species in the synthesis solutions are positively charged. The method involves a number of steps, which can be summarized as: (i) introduction of precursor species into the resin by ion exchange; (ii) secondary treatment to transform the precursor into a desired phase; and (iii) removal of the ion exchanger by calcination. The first two steps can be performed simultaneously by hydrothermally treating the resin with synthesis solution, where inorganic material is initially ion exchanged into the resin and transformed into a zeolite upon hydrothermal treatment. The steps (i) and (ii) may also be separated by firstly treating the resins with precursor solutions and then converting the exchanged species into a molecular sieve by secondary treatment with additional components and/or structure directing agents. Upon calcination the ion exchange resin and zeolite structure directing agents are removed leaving porous molecular sieve structures with a shape determined by the shape of the resin macrotemplate. The calcined macrostructures can be employed in secondary synthesis for the preparation of composite macrostructures containing two types of molecular sieves. Modified molecular sieve macrostructures were also prepared by the method. These macrostructures correspond to molecular sieve macrostructures containing various transition metal oxides. The modification is performed as a post-synthesis procedure. It {{is based on the}} fact that as synthesized resin-molecular sieve composites retain a certain degree of ion exchange capacity, which facilitates the introduction of charged metal ions. The procedure was demonstrated for both: (i) metal cations, which were exchanged into the cation exchange resin-molecular sieve composite; and (ii) negatively charged metal species, which were exchanged into anion exchange resin-molecular sieve composites. Upon calcination of a complex <b>metal</b> precursor-resin-molecular <b>sieve</b> composite modified molecular sieve macrostructures were obtained. The properties of non-modified and modified molecular sieve macrostructures were extensively characterized by various methods (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman and UV-vis DRS spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen adsorption and chemisorption measurements) to study the crystallization mechanism, sample crystallinity and morphology, nature of the metal species, etc. The non-modified molecular sieve macrostructures are of interest for application as catalysts and catalyst supports, adsorbents and packing materials, whereas modified macrostructures are of interest mainly in the area of catalysis.

40|$|Introduction: Biohydrogenation (BH) is a {{microbial}} hydrogenation {{of dietary}} unsaturated fatty acids {{occurring in the}} rumen. BH is of interest because it directly affects the fatty acids composition of milk and meat. The linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) BH {{is divided into three}} reactions: isomerisation into conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), reduction to trans-C 18 : 1 and then to stearic acid (C 18 : 0); that of alpha-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) into four reactions: isomerisation to conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA), reduction to trans 11,cis 15 -C 18 : 2, then to trans-C 18 : 1 and finally to C 18 : 0. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare enzymatic activities of the reactions of C 18 : 2 BH to those of C 18 : 3 BH. Materials and methods: Rumen fluid was collected from a dry dairy cow and strained on a <b>metal</b> <b>sieve</b> (1, 6 mm). Then, it was mixed with Chloramphenicol (Cm), an inhibitor of protein synthesis in prokaryotes, at a dose of 1 mg/mL. Incubations were prepared by adding 1 mL of rumen fluid + Cm, with 1 mL of bicarbonate buffer and 1 mg of C 18 : 2 or C 18 : 3 (purity ≥ 99 %, Sigma), and were conducted in a waterbath at 39 °C, with 3 h agitation, in 3 replicates. Fatty acids were quantified by gas chromatography. Then rate (v, mg/L/h) and efficiency (E, %) of the reactions were calculated. Results and Discussion: The isomerisation of C 18 : 3 was quicker and more efficient than that of C 18 : 2, which was probably saturated 2 (v = 129. 6 vs. 94. 4 mg/L/h; E = 80. 2 vs. 52. 7 %, respectively. The reductions of conjugated isomers were rapid and efficient, mainly for CLnA (v = 123. 7 mg/L/h; E= 95. 5 %) compared to CLA (v = 78. 1 mg/L/h; E= 82. 0 %). However, for C 18 : 2 BH, cis 9,trans 11 -CLA disappeared quicker than trans 10,cis 12 -CLA so that their respective production after 3 h incubation was + 0. 016 mg vs. + 0. 073 mg. The last reduction of C 18 : 2 BH was the slowest (v = 63. 8 mg/L/h; E= 68. 9 %), and constituted the limiting step, resulting in trans-C 18 : 1 accumulation. The second reduction of C 18 : 3 BH was very slow and poorly efficient (v = 48. 8 mg/L/h; E= 38. 2 %), so that trans 11,cis 15 -C 18 : 2 highly accumulated (+ 0. 450 mg produced). The last reduction of C 18 : 3 BH was also a slow and poorly efficient reaction (v = 38. 8 mg/L/h; E= 41. 9 %), so that trans-C 18 : 1 would probably have accumulated with a longer incubation. Conclusion: The BH of C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3 were not exactly similar. C 18 : 2 BH was slower, its isomerisation seemed to be rapidly saturable and the limiting step was the final reduction inducing an accumulation of trans-C 18 : 1. For C 18 : 3 BH, first and second reactions were rapid, so that few CLnA was present in the media. Contrarily, the third and fourth reactions were slow so that trans 11,cis 15 -C 18 : 2 firstly accumulated. Such an evolution was previously reported in vitro with live mixed ruminal bacteria 2, indicating that the evaluation of BH does not require live bacteria, and confirming the validity and interest of this enzymatic approach...|$|E
