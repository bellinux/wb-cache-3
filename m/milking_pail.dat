50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{roadside}} eateries {{were spread}} throughout most major highways. To stay competitive, restaurants needed to provide variety for their patrons, to stand out from other establishments. The Country Tea Room initially struggled with this change, but was able to reinvent itself as the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> Restaurant, a full restaurant with unique entrees. Part of the property was converted into The Fin 'n Feather Catalogue, which sold smoked game, some of which featured on the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> menu. McGraw bought the surrounding land, named it the McGraw Wildlife Foundation, and opened it as a private game preserve. The main building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 25, 1999. Today, the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> remains open and is a popular local location for wedding receptions.|$|R

50|$|The eighth season opened August 21, 1854, with Barrett as stage manager, {{replacing}} Mr. Barry. Miss Davenport {{played two}} engagements totaling four weeks, in Camille and Adrienne and opposite Conway in both Ingomar and Evadne. E. L. Davenport played five weeks, {{two of them}} with his wife, Fanny Vining, who made her American debut (opposite her husband) March 2 in Loves Sacrifice. He performed as Richard III, Brutus, Rolla in Pizarro, Hercule in Civilization, St. Pierre in James Sheridan Knowles The Wife, and William in Black-Eyed Susan, and in two plays by J. H. Wilkins, The Egyptian, and St. Marc, the latter with Ponisi and Conway. Vining played opposite her husband in Hamlet, The Lady of Lyons, Othello, Much Ado About Nothing, and W. Robsons Love and Loyalty. She also played a week without him, opposite Conway, in Romeo and Juliet, The Love Chase, and a new comedy called Charitys Love. A double bill of A New Way to Pay Old Debts (Davenport only), and Charitys Love (Vining and Conway) closed their engagement on May 26. Forrest appeared nine weeks in two engagements, performing in Pizarro, Brutus, The Lady of Lyons, and Coriolanus, among his other roles. William Harrison and Louisa Pyne performed twelve {{and a half weeks}} of opera, including La sonnambula, The Bohemian Girl, William Vincent Wallaces Maritana, Fra Diavolo, The Crown Diamonds, The Beggars Opera, Guy Mannering, The Enchantress, and Cinderella. Agnes Robertson played three weeks, in The Maid With the <b>Milking</b> <b>Pail,</b> The Young Actress, and Asmodeus, as Carlo. She also appeared as Andy Blake, Don Leander, the Fairy Star, and Bob Nettles. Her husband, Dion Boucicault, appeared with her the last week. A Midsummer Nights Dream was revived for one week. Eloise Bridges began a two-week run March 12. The season ended on June 2, 1855. There followed summer seasons by Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams (June 25 - July 31) and Gabriel Ravel et al.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was carried out to explore the {{potential}} source of contamination and the efficacy of different washing practices towards quality milk production. Materials and Methods: Probable sources of contamination viz. stored water, potable water, milker’s hands, <b>milking</b> <b>pail,</b> udder of individual buffalo and milk cans were subjected to different types of bacterial counts before the actual experiment to start. Twenty milch buffaloes thereafter were divided randomly into four treatment groups where washing was performed in each step viz. milker hands, udder of individual buffalo, <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> and milk cans before milking either with water (T 0 : stored water, T 1 : potable water) or sanitizers (T 2 : 200 ppm chlorine solution, T 3 : 50 ppm iodophore solution) for 60 days. Bacterial counts again were performed for last 5 alternate days for all the sources involved along with the microbial load of raw milk. Data obtained were subjected to standard statistical analysis. Results: It was found that for all bacterial count stored water contributed significantly higher {{as compared to the}} potable water. Among the other potential sources of contamination (log/ 6 cm 2), standard plate count (SPC) and coliform count were significantly highest for <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> (6. 73 ± 0. 02) and udder of milch buffaloes (3. 77 ± 0. 12), respectively, while for Staphylococci count both <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> (3. 24 ± 0. 02) and milking can (3. 22 ± 0. 04) were contributed maximally (p 0. 05) for most of the parameters, even for the raw milk quality. Conclusion: Study revealed that milker hands, milking pails, udder of animals, milk cans and stored water used for washing of equipment are the potential source of contamination in raw milk. These were counted as critical point which needs attention for the production of high-quality milk. Potable water was found to be better than stored water. The use of either chlorine 200 ppm and iodophor 50 ppm is highly effective in reducing the bacterial population for quality milk production...|$|E

To meet the demands of the changing tastes of travelers in the 1930s, the teahouse was converted into a full restaurant, featuring game from McGraw's nearby game preserve. The main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|R
60|$|On {{asking for}} a further explanation, Rollo learned that the mountaineers were {{accustomed}} to drive their herds up the mountains in the summer to places too cold to be inhabited all the year round, and to live there with them in these little huts during {{the two or three}} months while the grass was green. The men would bring up their <b>milking</b> <b>pails,</b> their pans, their churns, their cheese presses, and their kettles for cooking, and thus live in a sort of encampment while the grass lasted, and make butter and cheese to carry down the mountain with them when they returned.|$|R

Apprenticeships were considered [...] "indentures" [...] and an apprentice would start out first with simply cleaning the shop, polishing tools, keeping the fires lit, filing sharp edges and polishing finished pieces. Later he would trace patterns on sheets and cut them out, then soldering joints, and inserting rivets. Finally, {{he was allowed to}} cut out and complete objects. He learned first to make cake stamps (cookie cutters), pill boxes and other simple items. Next, he formed objects such as <b>milk</b> <b>pails,</b> basins, cake and pie pans. Later he tackled more complicated pieces such as chandeliers and crooked-spout coffee pots.|$|R
5000|$|Coopering, or barrel making, {{remained}} an important occupation through the nineteenth century. Using froes to split barrel staves and curved “sun” planes {{to shape the}} ends of mounted staves, coopers produced containers of all sizes. Ranging from small water and liquor kegs to 206-gallon hogsheads, their barrels stored goods including tobacco, whale oil, whiskey, molasses, flour, apples, sugar, and hardware. Household appliances such as water tubs, sap buckets, butter churns, <b>milk</b> <b>pails,</b> and drinking or ladling mugs called piggins, reflected the extensive reach of a coopers’ trade. The United States 1850 census recorded forty-three thousand practicing coopers, but by the late nineteenth century, the introduction of metal drums and other machine-made storage and shipping containers greatly diminished the demand for wooden cooperage so that today the craft is almost nonexistent.|$|R
