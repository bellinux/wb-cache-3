500|$|MacFarlane is {{passionate about}} {{his support for}} gay rights. In 2008 he called it [...] "infuriating and idiotic" [...] that two gay {{partners}} [...] "have {{to go through this}} fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about <b>my</b> <b>support</b> for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E

2500|$|At another poetry reading, Common said, [...] "flyers say 'free Mumia' on my freezer", a {{reference}} to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was controversially convicted of killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. Common stated, [...] "The one thing that shouldn't be questioned is <b>my</b> <b>support</b> for the police officers and troops that protect us every day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{said that}} the dispute was over one {{communication}} on behalf of her client to his supporters via a Reuters article, followed by a clarification after it {{appeared to have been}} misinterpreted.

2500|$|In the book, she contrasted {{her close}} gay friends with today's homosexuals, who [...] "jiggle their bottoms, put their little {{fingers in the}} air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through" [...] and that some {{contemporary}} homosexuals behave like [...] "fairground freaks". In her own defence, Bardot {{wrote in a letter to}} a French gay magazine: [...] "Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos. For years, they have been <b>my</b> <b>support,</b> my friends, my adopted children, my confidants." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 27, 2009, President Obama announced, [...] "As a {{candidate}} for president, I made clear <b>my</b> <b>support</b> for a timeline of 16 months {{to carry out this}} drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we've made and protect our troops... Those consultations are now complete, and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months." [...] Around 50,000 non-combat-related forces will remain. Obama's plan drew wide bipartisan support, including that of defeated Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain.|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} that Penthouse would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that [...] "the heightened spectacle and circus {{of it all}} was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' [...] " [...] Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard on her mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her [...] "duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America." [...] Helen was also upset that [...] "the pageant {{did not come to}} <b>my</b> <b>support,</b> they felt I needed to resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mobutu {{also had}} a cordial {{relationship}} with Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush; {{he was the first}} African head of state to visit Bush at the White House. Even so, Mobutu's relationship with the US radically changed shortly afterward {{with the end of the}} Cold War. With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: [...] "I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. The lesson is that <b>my</b> <b>support</b> for American policy counts for nothing." [...] In 1993, Mobutu was denied a visa by the US State Department after he sought to visit Washington, DC.|$|E
