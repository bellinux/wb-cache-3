ROIC design for such applications is challenging due to complex requirements and often needs iterative fabrications {{to meet all}} requirements.

40|$|The robust {{estimation}} of the tiny distortions (shears) of galaxy shapes caused by weak gravitational lensing {{in the presence of}} much larger shape distortions due to the point-spread function (PSF) has been widely investigated. One major problem is that most galaxy shape measurement methods are subject to bias due to pixel noise in the images ("noise bias"). <b>Noise</b> <b>bias</b> is usually characterized using uncorrelated noise fields; however, real images typically have low-level noise correlations due to galaxies below the detection threshold, and some types of image processing can induce further noise correlations. We investigate the effective detection significance and its impact on <b>noise</b> <b>bias</b> in the presence of correlated noise for one method of galaxy shape estimation. For a fixed <b>noise</b> variance, the <b>biases</b> in galaxy shape estimates can differ substantially for uncorrelated versus correlated noise. However, use of an estimate of detection significance that accounts for the noise correlations can almost entirely remove these differences, leading to consistent values of <b>noise</b> <b>bias</b> as a function of detection significance for correlated and uncorrelated noise. We confirm the robustness of this finding to properties of the galaxy, the PSF, and the noise field, and quantify the impact of anisotropy in the noise correlations. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the pixel noise model and its impact on detection significances when correcting for <b>noise</b> <b>bias</b> on weak lensing.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Space Physics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Multipath {{amplifier}} theory: In {{this thesis}} {{it is proven}} that the theoretical <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measure of a multipath amplifier (an amplifier which has multiple parallel amplifiers) is achieved by using the optimum source impedance for the amplifier and the optimum gain for each amplification path. This optimum source impedance and gain can be calculated by using the optimum–loaded input network, i. e. by replacing each amplifier with its optimum source impedance. The resulting noise measure {{is the same as}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measure of the amplifiers used in the amplification paths. Whereas single–path amplifiers can achieve this <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measure over narrow bandwidths, multipath amplifiers are theoretically able to achieve the <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measure over very broad bandwidths. The theory is demonstrated by applying it to distributed amplifiers. In an ideal distributed amplifier, the magnitude of the optimum gain of the amplification paths decreases and the phase delay increases the farther the stage is from the input, with the decrease in gain being faster for higher frequencies. The challenge in designing broadband, low–noise, distributed amplifiers is to achieve optimum gain matching over broad bandwidths. Multipath amplifier design procedure: Based on the theory, a three step design and optimisation procedure is introduced. Firstly, unconditionally stable amplification paths are designed to have small <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measures, then an input network is designed for optimum source impedance matching and lastly an output network is designed for gain matching. Multipath amplifier prototype: The theory and design procedure is demonstrated by optimising a 0. 5 – 2 GHz distributed amplifier. An average noise measure of 0. 3 dB is achieved, which is only 0. 1 dB higher than the <b>minimum</b> <b>noise</b> measure of the amplification stages used. This increase is mainly due to transmission line loss and gain mismatch. Radio telescope feasibility: Multipath amplifiers break the trade–off between noise temperature, bandwidth and source termination that a single–path amplifier has, because they have much more design freedom when designing the input network. In general, the more paths, the larger the low–noise bandwidth, but the larger and more complex the amplifier. Roughly two to three amplification paths are required per octave of bandwidth for LNAs around 1 GHz. When the bandwidth is very narrow, a single path is sufficient. Multipath amplifiers have similar trade–offs between linearity and power consumption, between noise temperature and noise resistance, and between noise temperature and size to a single–path amplifier. Multipath amplifiers are therefore a feasible alternative for use in radio telescopes. Doctora...|$|R

Two major effects have been identified which are likely to account {{for most of the}} bias for maximum likelihood methods in recent shear measurement challenges. Model bias occurs when the true galaxy shape is not well represented by the fitted model. <b>Noise</b> <b>bias</b> occurs due to the non-linear relationship between image pixels and galaxy shape. In this paper we investigate the potential interplay between these two effects when an imperfect model is used in the presence of high noise. We present analytical expressions for this bias, which depends on the residual difference between the model and real data. They can lead to biases not accounted for in previous calibration schemes. By measuring the model <b>bias,</b> <b>noise</b> <b>bias</b> and their interaction, we provide a complete statistical framework for measuring galaxy shapes with model fitting methods from GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT) like images.
