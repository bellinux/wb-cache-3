40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} electromagnetic {{processes in the}} system for induction heating presented by a flat circular <b>multiturn</b> <b>solenoid</b> positioned above a plane of thin sheet non-magnetic metal has been conducted. The calculated dependences for the current induced in a metal sheet blank and ratio of transformation determined have been obtained. The maximal value of the transformation ratio with regard to spreading the eddy-currents over the whole area of the sheet metal has been determined...|$|E
