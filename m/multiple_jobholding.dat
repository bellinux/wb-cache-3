40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding,</b> there is relatively little research into its causes. Existing research has tested the predictions of standard labor models with micro data. Yet, there has been virtually no research into the relationship between moonlighting and structural differences in regional labor markets such as wages and employment growth. In this manner, this study examines the large differences in <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> rates across U. S. states. The findings indicate that <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> acts as a short-term shock absorber to cyclical changes. However, in the long-term, these effects dissipate, indicating that moonlighting plays a similar role as do changes in unemployment and labor-force participation to regional labor market shocks. Conversely, <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> rates are inversely related to average weekly earnings. Thus, job growth accompanied by real wage (and productivity) growth {{may result in a}} decline in <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding,</b> further exacerbating potential labor shortages. Other key factors found to influence <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> include occupational structure and education.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> empirically using a {{specially}} collected database {{for the region}} of Magnesia in Greece. We find that although income plays a major deterministic impact on <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding,</b> other factors have a determining the final outcome of the individual’s choice. These determining factors can either explain the amount of fixed costs that is involved towards taking up a second job, or the restrictions arising from the individual’s personal and family characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{labor market}} {{experienced}} {{a more than}} 20 percent reduction in the share of workers holding multiple jobs over the past 20 years. While this substantial trend is receiving increasing attention, the literature lacks a comprehensive picture of the gross worker flows that underlie the evolution of <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding.</b> In this paper, first we construct new estimates of worker transitions {{into and out of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> based on a Markov chain model that addresses several measurement issues. In particular, we show that time-aggregation bias cannot be ignored, as has been done in previous studies: workers typically hold a second job {{for a short period of}} time, which imparts a large bias in the estimates of transition probabilities. We go on to conduct a decomposition of the downward trend in <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> into the evolution of the underlying worker flows. This decomposition indicates that the trend is overwhelmingly explained by the dwindling propensity of full-time workers to take on a second job. We view the decrease in <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> as another manifestation of the changing labor supply behavior of U. S. workers observed during the past decades...|$|E
30|$|The {{dynamics}} of dual jobholding {{have been the}} focus of Böheim and Taylor (2004 a) as well as of Paxson and Sicherman (1996). The duration of moonlighting is addressed by Marshall (2002) and Kimmel and Smith Conway (2001). Again, the main results are consistent with the presence of multiple motives for dual jobholding, with the ‘hours-constraints’ motive being the most common. Amuedo-Dorantes and Kimmel (2005) examine the cyclicality of <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> and find support for procyclical behavior of moonlighters.|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} research on <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> covers a wide range of both {{theoretical and empirical}} topics. Shishko and Rostker (1976) were the first who combined theoretical reasoning with empirical analyses. While they acknowledge {{that there might be}} reasons for moonlighting other than hours-constraints on the main job, the empirical part of their analysis is based on that rationale only. More recent research also addresses other motives and different issues of interest. In particular, Schwarze (1991) extends the theoretical background by explicitly incorporating job-quality in the model. His findings, which are based on cross-sectional data from the German SOEP, reinforce the importance of this extended model.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the interrelated dynamics of dual jobholding, human capital, occupational choice, and mobility, using a panel sample (1991 - 2005) of UK employees from the British Household Panel Survey. The {{evidence suggests that}} individuals may be using <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> as a conduit for obtaining new skills and expertise and as a stepping-stone to new careers, also involving self-employment. Individuals doing a different secondary job than their primary occupation {{are more likely to}} switch to a new primary job in the next year, and a job that is different than their current primary employment. The results show that there are human capital spillover effects between primary and secondary employment...|$|E
30|$|The {{supply of}} labor {{in more than one}} job has not been on the top of labor economists’ agendas for long. Although there is an {{established}} literature, it is far from extensive. In contrast to the ever increasing literature on atypical employment, <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> as another facet has by and large gone unnoticed. This is somewhat surprising as this form of labor supply is as closely related to changes in labor market institutions and regulations, as for example part-time and fixed term employment. Furthermore, moonlighting is a rather widespread phenomenon in most of the Western industrialized countries. For the US and Canada, several studies by official labor statistics bureaus provide (mainly descriptive) evidence for moonlighting trends over time (Stinson 1997; Sussman 1998).|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{personal}} interests {{are also a}} motive for <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding.</b> Informant 1, for example, developed an interest in psychology for personal reasons, in order to solve personal problems. On graduating from university, she opened her own private psychological counselling service. In addition to her full-time job with an international multinational firm, she holds her own private practice on weekends, not for financial reasons, but “as a private interest”. Informant 7, who speaks French, also happens to do occasional translation work {{in addition to her}} full-time salaried job, both out of personal interest and to increase her income. Informant 14 occasionally works for a friend’s firm both to boost his income and out of his own interest, “to learn new things” (xue xin de dongxi).|$|E
30|$|As an {{extension}} {{to the standard}} model, Schwarze (1991) examines the effects of heterogeneous jobs by including a ‘job-quality’ factor for both main and moonlighting job in the individual's utility function. While it would be desirable to have clear cut theoretical propositions, he shows {{that the quality of}} both jobs is ambiguously affiliated to <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding.</b> In particular, whether improving working conditions on the first job implies an increase in moonlighting depends on whether the increase in job quality results in a higher marginal utility of leisure. If so, moonlighting will decrease. It however may also be that poor working conditions on the main job enhance the need to regenerate in the spare time. Analogously, assuming improving working conditions, leisure might then not be needed that much to recover from stress. Secondary jobholding may then increase.|$|E
30|$|It {{is hard to}} {{pinpoint}} the norm in terms of employment in today’s China. Individuals are looking for security and stability {{on the one hand}} and looking to seize the opportunities created by economic growth on the other side. A standard is a product of economic, social and political processes. It is the result of a social construct built by many players. What we argue is that stable wage-earning employment far from describes the variety of forms of employment among white-collar workers in contemporary China. This is due to both the weight of the various forms of employment (formal, informal, part time, etc.) and the fact that individuals move from one form to another and combine different forms of employment. What we find is mobility on one side of the equation and <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> on the other.|$|E
30|$|A second {{feature of}} the Chinese case is the strong embeddedness of career paths in social networks. For instance, social {{obligations}} {{appear to be an}} important motive for <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding.</b> Informant 12 graduated from a business school. Although she has a full-time job, she occasionally lends a hand to small private firms based in the small town where she was born and where her parents have a private business. These are small family-run businesses not familiar with accounting regulations and they need her help to draw up proper financial statements. These occasional collaborations come to her through her social network in her home town. She also has another side source of income: she often travels abroad for a current employer and takes the opportunity to buy foreign cosmetic products, which she then sells on the Taobao e-commerce website once back in China.|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the percentage of}} families involved in off-farm employment provided the intellectual fodder for a symposium on <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> among farm families held in May, 1988. Like other books that are the off-spring of conferences and symposia, the weaknesses of the symposium are replicated in the book unless the editors apply a heavy hand to ensure interrelatedness and quality of contributions. Unfortunately, evidence of this editorial hand is missing: the book is uneven and fails to demonstrate the interconnections between chapters. Yet, even with this caveat, there are several significant research/modeling contributions and review essays. The five sections, which contain the history and definition of, causes of, surveys of, labor supply of, and social policies of multiple job holding, are written for agricultural economists, and provide a current (up to 1988) overview of the theoretical and empirical work governing multiple job-holding by American Canadian farm families...|$|E
30|$|As another alternative, {{measurements}} of hours worked and volume of {{work can be}} derived directly from survey interviews. For most of the establishment surveys, however, the findings are limited to particular groups of persons or companies, questions relate to paid hours rather than actual hours worked, or interviews take place only infrequently. Also in household interviews, e.[*]g., labour force surveys, the questions to record hours actually worked and not worked, respectively, are not sufficient to yield a solid overall figure. Besides typical problems with household surveys such as proxy interviewing or memory errors, questions on “hours actually worked last week” or similar questioning may induce a systematic bias due to underreported occurrence of components such as holidays or sick leave which cause interviews not to take place. Likewise, <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> is underreported by survey participants as was found by Steward (2014) for U.S. data. Fleck (2009), who also discusses several other shortcomings of surveys when measuring hours worked, shows that, all in all, the hours worked series estimated directly from labour force surveys provide higher measures as compared to other concepts.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the autonomy of}} visual artists {{in an era of}} a booming creative economy and simultaneously declining governmental support for the arts and culture. The research is particularly directed toward the concept of autonomy. On the one hand, there is social autonomy, which can be deduced from the level of autonomy that the field of cultural production has as such, relative to the dominant field of power (politics and economics). On the other hand, there is artistic autonomy, which refers to the level of autonomy individual artists have in their artistic practices. Both can be determined by investigating overall tendencies in the practices and perceptions of the collective of artists. While there are a significant number of artists who can be pinned to either one of the opposing poles, it is exactly the in-between place that can help to determine potential value shifts within the art world. As political and economic restraints have been put on the field of cultural production from the outside, the question must be about the effect this has on the inside. By looking at the group of artists that engages in both autonomous production and more commercial applied art production as part of their <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> practices, it is possible to make distinctions...|$|E
40|$|Hours worked is an {{important}} economic indicator. In {{addition to being a}} measure of labor utilization, average weekly hours are inputs into measures of productivity and hourly wages, which are two key economic indicators. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' two hours series tell very different stories. Between 1973 and 2007 average weekly hours estimated from the BLS's household survey (the Current Population Survey or CPS) indicate that average weekly hours of nonagricultural wage and salary workers decreased slightly from 39. 5 to 39. 3. In contrast, average hours estimated from the establishment survey (the Current Employment Statistics survey or CES) indicate that hours fell from 36. 9 to 33. 8 hours per week. Thus the discrepancy between the two surveys increased from about two-and-a-half hours per week to about five-and-a-half hours. Our goal in the current study is to reconcile the differences between the CPS and CES estimates of hours worked and to better understand what these surveys are measuring. We examine a number of possible explanations for the divergence of the two series: differences in workers covered, <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding,</b> differences in the hours concept (hours worked vs. hours paid), possible overreporting of hours in CPS, and changes in the length of CES pay periods. We can explain most of the difference in levels, but cannot explain the divergent trends. comparison of household and establishment surveys, hours of work...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the labor market for artists and in the {{creative}} industries more broadly: How important is a formal education for jobs in the creative industries? How are the careers of people with a creative education? Do they work in the creative industries or outside the creative industries? How is the profile of the jobs within the creative industries? Alper and Wassall (2006) present an overview of the economic, mainly empirical research concerning the labor market of artists. Different types of studies can be distinguished: theoretical models of artistic career processes, qualitative interviews and data, retrospective surveys and panel data based on surveys (either true panel studies or quasi panel studies). Some of the most extended studies on artists’ earnings are done by Alper and Wassall on American census data, where data comes from peoples selfreporting in surveys, and peoples’ occupation is based on time spent at work during a single reference week. This do obvious have some drawbacks. Register data from Statistics Denmark representing true panel data, makes it possible to overcome some of these problems and gain new knowledge on the career patterns of artists, their income, the importance of education, <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding</b> etc. The register data used in this paper includes a lot of variables on socio-economy, income, employment etc. for the Danish population in the period 1994 - 2003. The paper includes a discussion and delimitation of artist and the creative industries, and presents new empirical results on the labor market for artists and in the creative industrie...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the labor supply decisions of temporary workers {{in order to determine}} who these workers are, the welfare of these workers and if their choice of employment is a result of their preferences or of labor market constraints. In Chapter 1 I summarize the existing literature and outline the direction of my future research in this area. Chapter 2 uses cross-sectional data from the Current Population Survey for 1985 and 1995, and looks at the changes in earnings and composition of the temporary labor force between 1985 and 1995. I find among other things that 1) the wage differential between temporary and non-temporary workers has narrowed over the ten-year period, 2) the composition of the temporary labor force has changed; there has been an influx of Latinos, Blacks and other racial minorities entering the temp sector and, 3) there is evidence that the temporary labor market is becoming more organized in terms of firms specializing and offering non-pecuniary benefits in order to recruit, attract, and retain workers. In Chapter 3, I use the May 1985 Current Population Survey: Work Schedules, <b>Multiple</b> <b>Jobholding</b> and Premium Pay (CPS) to examine the preferences of workers for more hours, fewer hours or the same number of hours from the benchmark of the number of hours they currently work. I find strong evidence that contingent workers are significantly more likely to desire more hours than they currently can obtain, even after conditioning on a fairly full set of personal and job characteristics. In the Chapter 4 I use the NLSY 79 to examine from the change from regular to contingent employment and vice versa, on family earnings. Since contingent employment is an increasingly common means of securing employment, {{it is important to understand}} whether the change in job status stated above adversely affects the economic outcome of the family unit. Results show that family earnings are adversely affected by the change in work status from regular to contingent employment although the spouse mitigates this through compensatory spousal contribution...|$|E
40|$|This chapter studies {{how and why}} artistic {{labor markets}} have {{expanded}} along a path of unbalanced growth. Long-term employment which nurtures the Baumolian cost disease persists only in large, heavily subsidized and sponsored organizations. The now dominant project-based system of production, with its functional needs for flexibility, relies on short-term assignments. Large parts of the business risk are transferred down onto the workforce in vertically disintegrated organizational settings. Artists and technical workers act mainly as contingent workers, freelancers and independent contractors; labor supply is patterned by repeated and discontinuous alternations between work and unemployment, and workers cycle between multiple jobs {{inside and outside the}} arts. Thus artistic labor markets display the main characteristics of a textbook model of imperfect monopolistic competition: excess supply of labor, unbounded differentiation of production, reputational rents, a population of small firms that has been growing as fast as the number of artists. On the supply side, the attractiveness of artistic occupations has to be balanced against the risk of failure that turns ideally non-routine jobs into ordinary or ephemeral undertakings. Learning by doing plays such a decisive role that in many artforms initial training is an imperfect filtering device. Individuals learn to manage the risks of their trade through <b>multiple</b> <b>jobholding,</b> occupational role versatility, portfolio diversification of employment ties, and income transfers from public support, social insurance and social security programs. Ironically, the study of the artists' risk management shows how rationally they behave, although artistic work may be highly idiosyncratic. Thus artists may be seen less like rational fools than like Bayesian actors. How do vertically disintegrated systems of production shape individual careers and organizational behavior? Loose employment relationships do not preclude contractual stability. Employers use reputations as screening devices and signals of employability. Artists learn how to compose balanced sets of recurrent and non-recurrent hiring ties in order to secure a living as well as to increase their human capital. Considerable inequalities in amounts of work and earnings are observed, caused by the skewed distribution of talent and by joint consumption technologies that turn small differences in talent into huge earnings differentials. Inequalities may also trace back to the way a disintegrated labor market operates, since both the allocation of piecemeal work based on reputational rankings and team formation based on selective matchings magnify the power of differences in talent and work opportunity to increase inequality. These factors should not cause the kind of permanent excess supply of labor in the arts that has been noted for decades if the occupational commitment of artists were not combined with the management of business uncertainty through overproduction of infinitely differentiated goods and services. ...|$|E
