40|$|INTRODUCTION Several tools may be {{used for}} {{performance}} analysis. Coverage analysis tools [1] obtain a precise count of instructions executed in a program, a strong indication of the processing time required. Profilers [2] use sampling at regular time intervals to statistically determine the time spent in each function. Some profilers use hardware performance counters [3] to obtain program counter samples correlated to metrics other than CPU time, for instance cache misses, mispredicted branches or pipeline stalls. For CPU intensive applications, these tools produce useful and reasonably accurate measurements. However, this may not be sufficient for applications, or portions thereof, where interactions between one or more processes and the operating system impact significantly the performance. In many cases, resources managed by the operating system may indeed strongly affect the performance. This includes disk heads scheduling, I/O buffer cache, virtual memory <b>management,</b> <b>signal</b> del...|$|E

The mobile population {{is expected to reach}} the figure of nearly 1 billion in the near future. Several research efforts are being undertaken to address various issues in the design and operation of mobile networks. Some of the active research issues in mobile networking include channel allocation, mobility <b>management,</b> <b>signal</b> processing, fault tolerance, routing protocols and interoperability between different mobile networking protocols. In this dissertation we focus on a couple of these research issues namely mobility management and fault tolerance. Mobility management deals with managing the mobile nodes when they move. The network has to maintain connection to the mobile node inspite of the nodes changing location. We develop fundamental bounds for load balanced location management. We develop novel algorithms for load balanced location management in mobile networks. We later derive fundamental bounds satisfied by any load balanced location management algorithm in the presence of failures in the network. We then present a fast recovery protocol to recover from failures in the network. The salient feature of this protocol being the removal of the use of wireless bandwidth in the recovery process. We conclude the thesis by discussing some of the future issues in the area of mobile networks...|$|E

40|$|Many {{traditional}} {{signal processing}} techniques in finance have limited ability to explain trading processes and distributional {{properties of the}} actual market prices. This is typically manifested in model misspecification and pricing and forecasting inaccuracy. For instance, the assumption that log stock returns are normally distributed is widely used in modern mathematical finance. In practice, however, the distribution of stock market returns is better approximated by the q-Gaussian distribution from the new framework of Tsallis ’ nonextensive thermostatistics [1], [2]. In financial risk <b>management,</b> <b>signal</b> processing is of immense interest. In this context, one possible form of entropy associated with a time-dependent probability distribution is called the Shannon information measure (or the Shannon entropy). As the Shannon entropy {{does not account for}} long-range interactions (i. e., it is extensive or additive), it is generalized to nonextensitivity by the Tsallis information measure [or the Tsallis entropy (TE) ]. Nonextensive entropy (or the TE) that generalizes the classical and quantum statistics has recently emerged as a new paradigm in statistical mechanics. In addition to its long memory feature, the TE represents a powerful tool for the analysis of complex, nonlinear, and nonstationary signals. This article reviews the growing literature on the applications of TE in finance and economics. We begin by outlining the importance of financial risk management and the instruments employed for such purpose. Next, we cover the basics of th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To fully exploit {{wireless}} {{radio resource}} and, thus, increase spectrum efficiency, cognitive radios shall sense wire-less environments and identify interference to allow opportunis-tic transmissions for secondary systems. Based on Chen et al. {{in their work}} about a terminal architecture for cognitive radio networks, by further obtaining transmission information with a rate–distance nature that is extended from an overlay concept, secondary systems can even leverage busy duration of primary systems to enhance the opportunity to use spectrum under de-rived tolerable interference to the primary orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system. Our proposed novel multistate (i. e., existence, activity, and data transmission rate) spectrum sensing can thus effectively acquire a set of cognitive information for OFDMA mobile communication systems under a general system model. Through the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), fundamental symbol rate, cyclic property of the OFDMA signal, and the control and <b>management</b> <b>signal,</b> we can precisely determine the existence and activity of the primary (OFDMA) system within a subband via Neyman–Pearson (NP) criterion. With a priori knowledge of the frame structure of potential primary systems, communication parameters, includ-ing data transmission rate and resource allocation state, can be extracted by analyzing the frame header. Through appropriate parametric adjustments, our sensing procedure can be extended to state-of-the-art OFDMA systems. Index Terms—Cognitive cycle, cognitive radio, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), rate–distance relationship, spectrum sensing. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As CMOS {{technology}} scales {{into the}} deep submicrometer regime, digital noise is becoming a metric of importance comparable to area, timing, and power, for analysis and design of CMOS VLSI systems. Noise has two detrimental effects in digital circuits: First, it can destroy logical information carried by a circuit net. Second, it causes delay uncertainty: Noncritical paths might become critical because of noise. As a result, circuit speed becomes limited by noise, primarily because of capacitive coupling between wires. Most design approaches address the crosstalk noise problem at the layout generation stage, or via postlayout corrections. With continued scaling, too many circuit nets require corrections for noise, causing a design convergence problem. This work suggests to consider noise at the gate-level netlist generation stage. The paper presents a simplified analysis of on-chip crosstalk models, and demonstrates the significance of crosstalk between local wires within synthesized circuit blocks. A design flow is proposed for automatically synthesizing CMOS circuits that have improved robustness to noise effects, using standard tools, by limiting the range of gate strengths available in the cell library. The synthesized circuits incur a penalty in area/power, which can be partially recovered in a single postlayout corrective iteration. Results of design experiments indicate that delay uncertainty {{is the most important}} noise-related concern in synthesized static CMOS logic. Using a standard synthesis methodology, critical path delay differences up to 18 % of the clock cycle time have been observed in functional blocks of microprocessor circuits. By using the proposed design flow, timing uncertainty was reduced to below 3 %, with area and power penalties below 20 %. Index Terms—Crosstalk, delay uncertainty, noise, noise <b>management,</b> <b>signal</b> integrity, synthesis, timing verification. I...|$|E
