5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E

25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals.

Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> and camostat.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> was {{discovered}} by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 {{he found that the}} fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he could isolate the crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and gave the name <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid.</b> The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mycophenolic</b> <b>acid,</b> less {{accurately}} called mycophenolate, is an {{immunosuppressant drug}} {{used to prevent}} rejection in organ transplantation. It inhibits an enzyme needed {{for the growth of}} T cells and B cells. It was initially marketed as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to improve oral bioavailability. More recently, the salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Mycophenolate mofetil is marketed under the trade name CellCept and mycophenolate sodium as Myfortic.|$|E
50|$|Antimetabolites, also {{categorized}} as steroid-sparing agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid,</b> and leflunomide {{are often used}} as alternatives to corticosteroids. Of these, methotrexate is most widely used and studied. Methotrexate is considered a first-line treatment in neurosarcoidosis, often in conjunction with corticosteroids. Long-term treatment with methotrexate is associated with liver damage in about 10% of people and hence may be a significant concern in people with liver involvement and requires regular liver function test monitoring. Methotrexate {{can also lead to}} pulmonary toxicity (lung damage), although this is fairly uncommon and more commonly it can confound the leukopenia caused by sarcoidosis. Due to these safety concerns it is often recommended that methotrexate is combined with folic acid in order to prevent toxicity. Azathioprine treatment can also lead to liver damage. Leflunomide is being used as a replacement for methotrexate, possibly due to its purportedly lower rate of pulmonary toxicity. <b>Mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> has been used successfully in uveal sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis (especially CNS sarcoidosis; minimally effective in sarcoidosis myopathy), and pulmonary sarcoidosis.|$|E
50|$|Mycophenolate {{is derived}} from the fungus Penicillium stoloniferum or in P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid.</b> It {{reversibly}} inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells are able to recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect.|$|E
50|$|Mycophenolate mofetil is the prodrug of <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> (MPA) {{and widely}} {{used for the}} {{prevention}} of acute rejection after solid organ transplantation. MPA could be metabolized to AcMPAG, which is responsible for adverse effects of MMF therapy such as leucopenia or gastrointestinal toxicity. Deglucuronidation of AcMPAG may be a detoxification process and human ABHD10 could be a potential therapeutic drug. ABHD10 may also be used to regulate adverse effects of probenecid, because it catalyze the deglucuronidation of PRAG.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{has issued}} an alert that {{patients}} on mycophenolate mofetil and <b>mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> are {{at increased risk}} of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 patients that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal.|$|E

50|$|Disease-modifying {{antirheumatic}} drugs (DMARDs) {{are used}} preventively {{to reduce the}} incidence of flares, the progress of the disease, and the need for steroid use; when flares occur, they are treated with corticosteroids. DMARDs commonly in use are antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate and azathioprine). Hydroxychloroquine is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine has relatively few side effects, and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have SLE.Cyclophosphamide is used for severe glomerulonephritis or other organ-damaging complications. <b>Mycophenolic</b> <b>acid</b> is also used for treatment of lupus nephritis, but it is not FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women.|$|E
5000|$|Bartolomeo Gosio (17 March 1863 - 13 April 1944) was an Italian medical scientist.
