5|$|Out of {{isotopes}} whose half-lives are known, {{the lighter}} isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 50 μs for 253Rf and 254Rf were observed. 256Rf, 258Rf, 260Rf are <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> at around 10 ms, 255Rf, 257Rf, 259Rf, and 262Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds, and 261Rf, 265Rf, and 263Rf are <b>more</b> <b>stable,</b> at around 1, 1.5, and 10 min respectively. The heaviest isotopes {{are the most}} stable, with 267Rf having a measured half-life of about 1.3 h. Half-lives for 269Rf, 271Rf, and higher are not known and {{have not yet been}} predicted.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> lower oxidation states, though they are slightly <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{naturally}} occurring enantiomer of RNA is D-RNA composed of D-ribonucleotides. All chirality centers {{are located in}} the D-ribose. By the use of L-ribose or rather L-ribonucleotides, L-RNA can be synthesized. L-RNA is much <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> against degradation by RNase.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a reduction of}} a matrix to a condensed form, the upper $J$- Hessenberg form, via elementary symplectic Householder transformations, which are rank-one modification of the identity. Features of the reduction are highlighted. Two variants numerically <b>more</b> <b>stables</b> are then derived. Some numerical experiments are given, showing the efficiency of these variants...|$|R

5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore <b>more</b> <b>stable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Genome : The Liliaceae {{include the}} species {{with the largest}} genome size within the angiosperms, Fritillaria assyriaca (1C=127.4pg), while Tricyrtis macropoda is as small as 4.25pg. Chromosome numbers vary by genus. Some genera like Calochortus (x=6-10), Prosartes (6,8,9,11), Scoliopus (7,8), Streptopus (8, 27) and Tricyrtis (12-13) have a small and {{variable}} number of chromosomes while subfamily Lilioideae have a larger and <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> chromosome number (12) as have the Medeoleae (7).|$|E
5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

When Emperor Selassie was overthrown by the Derg regime, Sandford {{was forced to leave}} Ethiopia. His farm was nationalized and <b>more</b> <b>stables</b> were built {{to increase the number of}} cattle. Within a few years, the farm was not operational anymore.|$|R
