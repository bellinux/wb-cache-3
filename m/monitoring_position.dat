Investigated factors were light regime, plant community and <b>monitoring</b> <b>position.</b> Both insect composition and spatial preference of insect families was strongly dependent on light regime, field margin type and <b>monitoring</b> <b>position.</b> The number of insect families preferring the shaded side was fivefold higher {{than the number of}} families preferring the unshaded side. Particularly, insect families associated with moist conditions (Haliplidae, Dolichopodidae, etc.) were preferably or exclusively found on the shaded side characterised by higher soil moisture content. Some families (Bibionidae, Scatopsidae, Proctotrupoidea, etc.) showed higher abundance in the unsown field margin whilst others (Cicadellidae, Chalcidoidea, etc.) preferred the sown field margins. Similarly, some families (Lygaeidae, Cantharidae, etc.) occurred preferably in the field margin strip whilst others (Chironomidae, Empididae, Cicadellidae, etc.) preferred the adjacent field crop. Differential habitat preference might be explained by differences in botanical composition and structure of the vegetation. Insect diversity was significantly higher near the margin strip richest in botanical species (i. e. the unsown margin strip), reflecting the highest Shannon diversity index (2. 57). Furthermore, insect diversity was significantly higher on the shaded side, irrespective of <b>monitoring</b> <b>position,</b> with Shannon diversity indices between 2. 59 and 2. 70...|$|E

This {{may result in a}} change {{in the role of the}} air traffic control specialist from direct control to a position with more monitoring responsibilities. This change may result in a reduction of situation awareness, memory and vigilance. This experiment investigated the effect of moving a controller from the current active control to a <b>monitoring</b> <b>position.</b> It examined the effect of the change in involvement and task load by measuring eye movements, workload, situation awareness, system performance, controller performance ratings, organization of information in memory, and responses to questionnaires. Controllers received training on a generic en route airspace, the Genera High sector, during four practice simulations of 40 minutes each. They then worked four 30 -minute experimental scenarios. Results indicated that controllers showed a less structured scanning pattern under high task load and active involvement conditions. Measured workload correlated well with traffic volume. Under monitoring conditions, controllers perceived lower workload. Controller situation awareness was lower under monitoring conditions and decreased further with an increase in task load. Controllers perceived that their situation awareness did not change between active control and passive monitoring. The decrease in situation awareness warrants careful examination of the need for training and assistance of controllers for situations where they no longer function in the current active control position. 17.

40|$|The major {{obstacles}} to the widespread adoption of 3 D measurement systems are accuracy, speed of {{process and the}} cost. At present, high accuracy for measuring 3 D position has been achieved, {{and there have been}} real advances in reducing measurement time, but the cost of such systems remains high. A high-accuracy and high-resolution ultrasonic distance measurement system has been achieved in this project by creating multi-frequency continuous wave frequency modulation (MFCWFM) system. The low-cost system measures dynamic distance (displacements of an ultrasound transmitter) and fixed distance (distances between receivers). The instantaneous distance between the transmitter and each receiver can be precisely determined. New geometric algorithms for transmitter 3 D position and receiver positing have also been developed in the current research to improve the measurement system‟s practicability. These algorithms allow the ultrasound receivers to be arbitrarily placed and located by self-calibration following a simple procedure. After the development and testing of the new 3 D measurement system, further studies have also been carried out on the system, considering the two major external disturbances: air temperature drifting and ultrasound echo interference. Novel methods have been successfully developed and tested to minimize measurement errors and evaluation of speed of sound. All the enabling research described in the thesis means that it is now possible to build and implement a measurement system at reasonable cost for industrial exploitation.

40|$|Methylation of histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) is a {{key feature}} of silent {{chromatin}} and {{plays an important role}} in stabilizing the interaction of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) with chromatin. Genomes of metazoans such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster generally encode three types of H 3 K 9 -specific SET domain methyltransferases that contribute to chromatin homeostasis during the life cycle of the organism. SU(VAR) 3 - 9, dG 9 a, and dSETDB 1 all function in the generation of wild-type H 3 K 9 methylation levels in the Drosophila genome. Two of these enzymes, dSETDB 1 and SU(VAR) 3 - 9, govern heterochromatin formation in distinct but overlapping patterns across the genome. H 3 K 9 methylation in the small, heterochromatic fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster is governed mainly by dSETDB 1, whereas dSETDB 1 and SU(VAR) 3 - 9 function in concert to methylate H 3 K 9 in the pericentric heterochromatin of all chromosomes, with dG 9 a having little impact in these domains, as shown by <b>monitoring</b> <b>position</b> effect variegation. To understand how these distinct heterochromatin compartments may be differentiated, we examined the developmental timing of dSETDB 1 function using a knockdown strategy. dSETDB 1 acts to maintain heterochromatin during metamorphosis, at a later stage in development than the reported action of SU(VAR) 3 - 9. Surprisingly, depletion of both of these enzymes has less deleterious effect than depletion of one. These results imply that dSETDB 1 acts as a heterochromatin maintenance factor that may be required for the persistence of earlier developmental events normally governed by SU(VAR) 3 - 9. In addition, the genetic interactions between dSETDB 1 and Su(var) 3 - 9 mutations emphasize the importance of maintaining the activities of these histone methyltransferases in balance for normal genome function...|$|E
40|$|As mankind {{is passing}} time in {{enclosures}} (offices, meeting rooms, hospitals, vehicles, passenger airplanes, ships,….) {{and also in}} agricultural and industrial applications (livestock houses, incubation process, baking and malting processes,…) {{it has been more}} and more mandatory to improve and control indoor environments in the described enclosures in order to guarantee comfort, health and product quality with the minimum use of energy. However fulfilling the task of providing these requirements remains a great challenge because in all these ventilated structures there is an imperfectly mixed 3 D fluid. This means that there are 3 D spatial gradients and time variations of micro-environmental variables. In this doctoral thesis this issue is addressed. Thereby the overall goal is to gain more insight in the behaviour of micro-environment within the imperfectly mixed fluid in a ventilated space. A well known parameter that is used for long in the literature and in engineering of climate control and analysis is ‘the local mean age of air’. This parameter is defined as the time that incoming air particles need on average to reach a specific point within a ventilated room. The Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) model approach which is based on the Well Mixed Zone concept, has a physically meaningful parameter called the local mean fresh air flow concentration, β [m 3 /s. m 3]. This parameter shows the number of fresh air changes a WMZ receives per second. By using analytical analyses and experimental data, it is claimed in literature that this β parameter is an inverse of the local mean age of air. A first problem however is that the system excitation which is introduced by the inlet conditions during dynamic experiments was not always sufficient enough to supply the necessary informative 3 D dynamic data. Another problem is {{that it is impossible to}} measure accurately in experiments at finely spaced sensor locations the energy and mass transfer through 3 D well mixed zones with time varying shapes, dimensions and positions inside a ventilated room. The first objective of this thesis is to gain insight into this relation between the local mean age of air and the β parameter. In previous researchescharacterisation of the behaviour of shapes and volumes of well mixed zones were not studied sufficiently. Therefore the second objective is to analyse the behaviour of these 3 D well mixed temperature zones with respect to shape and volume inside a transient ventilation system. The third objective is to combine a complex and a low order modelling approach in order to supplement each other so that climate controller development can be integrated into the design of systems. In order to fulfil the first two objectives and to cope with the limitation of experiments in supplying the required informative data, dynamic mass and heat transfer numerical simulations were performed. The conclusion of the research shows that the inverse relation between the β parameter and the local mean age of air is justified by an average deviation of 6 % for the studied 36 monitoring positions. It was also possible by using the numerically simulated data to quantify the volumes, shapes and thermal interaction between neighbouring well mixed temperature zones. Moreover it is shown that the shapes and volumes of the transient well mixed zones are a function of position and acceptable temperature difference, i. e., process dependency. It was shown that to define a well mixed zone in an accurate way, beside an acceptable gradient as used by others, also the value of the considered variable (e. g. temperature) in a specific <b>monitoring</b> <b>position</b> must be taken into account. It was also highlighted that the results of the analysis have a positive impact in room partition procedures which is crucial in zonal modelling practices. Finally a methodology of using the results of numerical simulations in combination with low order data based models for temperature controller design purposes was developed. This might have important practical implications when experimental data are scarce or not available at all. status: publishe...|$|E

In many experiments, there are two different targets preceded by two different primes at the same <b>monitor</b> <b>positions.</b> Participants then have to discriminate the two targets and respond to the position of the task-relevant target. Sometimes, three stimulus types are employed (prime, mask, target), especially when the prime-target SOA has to be very long. Sometimes, no mask is employed at all. Primes and targets do not have to appear at the same screen position: One stimulus can flank the other, like in the Eriksen paradigm (indeed, the Eriksen effect may be a special case of response priming).|$|R
40|$|The root of {{conflict}} of interest problem arises {{as a response to}} the separation between management and ownership in firms, in which firm’s agents are motivated to adopt specific actions to maximise their personal wealth at the expense of shareholders. Therefore, various initiatives made by interested groups introduced corporate governance (CG) codes and ownership structure as deterrent monitoring tools to constrain earnings management (EM) behaviours. Motivated by a functionalist research paradigm, this thesis aims to evaluate the current effects of some of the key mechanisms of CG and ownership types in constraining EM decisions over firm’s accruals in Jordan. Taking advantage of the functionalist research paradigm, this thesis adopts a mixed-methodology approach in which a subjectivism and objectivism research positions are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the monitoring mechanisms in constraining EM techniques. Under the objectivist stand, a set of secondary data from 2009 to 2014 explores the relationships between internal CG mechanisms and ownership structure and EM phenomenon estimated by the Modified Jones (1995) model over a sample of 134 non-financial firms listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). In this strand, independent members, external directorships, board size, board meetings and non-duality managers were the main mechanisms selected to evaluate board-monitoring functions. Additionally, this thesis captures the monitoring effects of audit committees (AC) through three main characteristics (AC existence, AC independence and AC meetings). Finally, with regard to ownership structure, this part covers institutional owners, blockholder owners, managerial owners and family firms. After testing for normality, linearity, multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity and time-fixed effects, the regression results show a significant monitoring tendency for independent board members in constraining EM issue. However, as the number of external directorships occupied by board members increased, the likelihood of engaging in EM decisions increased significantly. Additionally, active boards (meetings) showed a deterrent <b>monitoring</b> <b>position</b> in reducing the passage of opportunistic behaviours over firm’s accruals. The regression analysis provided evidence that supports institutional theory regarding the existence of a separate AC. Indeed, the main finding claims that Jordanian directors have been responding to the Jordanian Securities Commission pressures in terms of establishing a separate AC in their firms since a positive correlation between EM levels and the presence of AC is documented. Statistically speaking, this thesis found evidence that independent members were inclined significantly to enhance financial reports quality by reducing the prevalence of EM behaviours in Jordan. Supporting the researcher hypotheses that assumed a significant monitoring role of the concentrated ownership in constraining managers’ opportunistic behaviours, only blockholder with at least 5 % of firm’s outstanding shares were significantly effective in controlling managers’ opportunistic behaviours estimated by discretionary accruals. However, and in line with the researcher expectations, family firms were a fertile environment for earnings management. With regard to the subjectivist approach, this thesis adopted other complementary approaches such as questionnaire and face-to-face interviews to achieve the research goals. Indeed, these approaches seek mainly to explore participants’ perceptions to evaluate the controlling functions of the monitoring tools, and further, to shed light on the main techniques used to alter firm’s earnings via accruals decisions. However, with a valid response rate (42. 8 %) extracted from 320 distributed questionnaires from various respondents (i. e. board members, AC members, external auditors and governmental employees), the participants noted the following techniques as the main choices to alter firm’s earnings in Jordan; “altering depreciation policy”, “altering account receivable policy” and “altering inventory amounts". In terms of the monitoring tools, in general, the participants suggested ownership mechanisms as a deterrent tool to constrain EM in comparison with CG mechanisms, in which the recorded perceptions revealed weak monitoring effects on EM decisions. To provide further insights to achieve the research objectives, the researcher interviewed twelve participants selected during the process of administering the questionnaires. The interviewees indicated favouritism, tribalism and Arab spring as the main obstacles that hindered the CG mechanisms from being deterrent tools to activate the monitoring roles of these mechanisms. In addition, independence issue for both board and AC members is still mere ink on paper since the previous obstacles played a significant role in restricting this issue in Jordan. It is worth mentioning that, adopting a functionalist research position to achieve the thesis goals through a mixed-methodology approach has helped the researcher to widen the adopted theoretical framework in this thesis, to go beyond the adoption of one theory (agency theory) by considering the effects of the institutional theory, resource dependency theory and stewardship theory. <br/...|$|E
