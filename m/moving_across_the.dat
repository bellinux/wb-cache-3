5|$|August 19–20, 1997: Tropical Storm Ignacio's {{remnants}} produced gusty winds {{over the}} outer waters of California, and passed {{directly over the}} San Francisco Bay Area, before <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> interior of the Pacific Northwest. Sporadic moderate to heavy rainfall was recorded in both California and {{the states of the}} Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|July 13, 1996- Tropical Storm Bertha crosses {{over the}} state with a peak wind gust of 58mph (93km/h) at Dover. The winds down {{scattered}} trees, signs, and power lines, leaving 3,200 homes without power for 8hours. The storm produces moderate rainfall across the state, causing drainage problems. Prior to <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> state, Bertha causes rough surf, resulting in 40 water rescues. Overall damage is minor, and no deaths occurred.|$|E

5|$|Prior to <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} Hawaii, strong {{thunderstorms}} {{developed in the}} northeastern portion of the remnant circulation of Fefa. The thunderstorms developed further as they moved over the slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in areas, resulting in flash flooding in Kohala and Hamakua. Hurricane Fefa resulted in no known deaths. Lightning from the storm caused two injuries. A man in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was hurt when lightning struck where he was walking. A man in Hilo was burnt when lightning moved through telephone wires. The storm resulted in no reported damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} at least eleven people were {{attributed}} to Ernesto, which dumped heavy rains throughout its path, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. While <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, it affected several countries, and initially Ernesto posed {{a threat to the}} Gulf Coast of the United States around the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Damage in Virginia was estimated at over $118million (2006USD), prompting the declaration of a federal disaster area. Total damage in the United States was estimated at $500million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E

5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere {{for days at a}} time across the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC on October 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon {{was first}} {{observed}} southwest of Guam on October 1, which progressed steadily westward. On October 4, the storm crossed the Philippines, entering from Borongan in Eastern Samar to Capiz {{and into the}} South China Sea. Heavy damage occurred along the path, and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage as it moved westward through Luzon. <b>Moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South China Sea, the storm struck {{the east coast of}} what was then Indochina on October11.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{state as}} a minimal hurricane, there were no reports of hurricane-force winds on {{mainland}} Florida. The highest official recorded wind report was 60mph (97km/h) in Miami Beach, while the highest accurate wind gust was 71mph (114km/h) in Vero Beach. In addition to the National Weather Service Reports, the South Florida Water Management District reported higher wind gusts near Lake Okeechobee of up to 93mph (150km/h) in Belle Glade, though these were likely caused by small-scale meso-cyclone-induced downbursts. Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida, peaking at 17.45inches (443mm) at Boynton Beach, though many areas in the Miami Metropolitan Area received from 10 to 15inches (255 to 380mm). One F1 and three F0 tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, injuring three people.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juan {{remained}} at peak intensity for over 24hours. After moving northwestward {{for an extended}} period of time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September29 with winds of 100mph (160km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September29. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lester was {{the first}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone to enter the United States as a tropical storm since 1967. The twelfth named storm and seventh hurricane of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Lester formed on August 20 from a tropical wave southwest of Mexico. The tropical storm moved generally northwestward while steadily intensifying. After turning to the north, approaching the Mexican coast, Lester attained hurricane status. The hurricane reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) before making landfall on west-central Baja California. The system weakened while <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> peninsula and then over northwestern Mexico. Not long after entering Arizona, Lester weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated on August 24, 1992, over New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Don {{failed to}} intensify {{significantly}} {{due to a}} misalignment between the lower and mid-level circulations. The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July28, although the winds increased slightly. Early on July29, Don attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) {{as reported by the}} Hurricane Hunters, and the storm maintained that intensity while <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. As Don approached the Texas coast early on July30, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler water temperatures just offshore. The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230UTC on July30. About {{three and a half hours}} later, Don degenerated into a remnant low, and the circulation dissipated six hours after that.|$|E
5|$|Kate {{made its}} first {{landfall}} on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November19. Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) the following day. On November21, a cold front <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, as a minimal Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h). Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline, and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water {{more or less in}} the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November {{it crossed}} the Volturno River and took Venafro. The {{division}} had great difficulty <b>moving</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> rivers {{and through the}} mountainous terrain, and the advance was slow. After linking up with the British Eighth Army, which had advanced from the south, the combined force, under the 15th Army Group, commanded by British General Sir Harold Alexander, was stalled when it reached the Gustav Line. Until 9 January 1944, the division, now under Major General William W. Eagles (replacing Major General Middleton who, struck down with arthritis, was sent to England to command VIII Corps in the Normandy invasion), inched forward into the mountains reaching St. Elia, north of Monte Cassino, before moving to a rest area.|$|E
