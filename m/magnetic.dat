5|$|Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field stops its {{atmosphere}} {{from being}} stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have <b>magnetic</b> fields, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a <b>magnetic</b> field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this <b>magnetic</b> field and material with Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the <b>magnetic</b> poles.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field {{caused by}} iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using <b>magnetic</b> instruments adapted from airborne <b>magnetic</b> anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the <b>magnetic</b> variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly <b>magnetic</b> mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable <b>magnetic</b> properties, these <b>magnetic</b> variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such <b>magnetic</b> materials record the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field.|$|E
5|$|The solar <b>magnetic</b> field extends {{well beyond}} the Sun itself. The {{electrically}} conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's <b>magnetic</b> field into space, forming {{what is called the}} interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the <b>magnetic</b> field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar <b>magnetic</b> field, with opposite hemispherical polarities {{on either side of the}} solar <b>magnetic</b> equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar <b>magnetic</b> field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar <b>magnetic</b> field. The Sun's dipole <b>magnetic</b> field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to <b>magnetic</b> fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar <b>magnetic</b> fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar <b>magnetic</b> field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal <b>magnetic</b> field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite <b>magnetic</b> polarities. The <b>magnetic</b> polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{geophysical}} prospecting companies also use <b>magnetic</b> detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, {{such as the}} Kursk <b>Magnetic</b> Anomaly.|$|E
5|$|Components of the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> {{field at}} the surface from the World <b>Magnetic</b> Model for 2015.|$|E
5|$|Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field, {{predominantly}} dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000kilometres per second. They carry with them a <b>magnetic</b> field, the interplanetary <b>magnetic</b> field (IMF).|$|E
5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast <b>magnetic</b> conditions such as <b>magnetic</b> storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a <b>magnetic</b> field around HD 209458 b was {{inferred}} {{from the way}} hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a <b>magnetic</b> field on an exoplanet. The <b>magnetic</b> field {{is estimated to be}} about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole <b>magnetic</b> field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary <b>magnetic</b> field. The induced <b>magnetic</b> moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the <b>magnetic</b> equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced <b>magnetic</b> field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall <b>magnetic</b> moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the <b>magnetic</b> moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with <b>magnetic</b> moments that line up in random directions when no <b>magnetic</b> field is present, but the <b>magnetic</b> moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} the <b>magnetic</b> field {{generated by the}} Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own <b>magnetic</b> fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These <b>magnetic</b> fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of <b>magnetic</b> particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without <b>magnetic</b> fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnetic</b> brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. <b>Magnetic</b> brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of <b>magnetic</b> brakes. <b>Magnetic</b> brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the <b>magnetic</b> field created by the brakes slows the train. <b>Magnetic</b> brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnetic</b> fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent <b>magnetic</b> field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's <b>magnetic</b> field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered <b>magnetic</b> fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of <b>magnetic</b> fields.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a <b>magnetic</b> field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the {{magnetized}} planets the <b>magnetic</b> field of Mercury is the weakest, and is {{barely able to}} deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's <b>magnetic</b> field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The <b>magnetic</b> fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their <b>magnetic</b> moments are significantly larger. The <b>magnetic</b> fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) <b>magnetic</b> moment independent of the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} <b>magnetic</b> moment of Mercury. The <b>magnetic</b> dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole <b>magnetic</b> field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak <b>magnetic</b> moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> field. The field {{strength}} at the <b>magnetic</b> equator (about 120 nT) created by this <b>magnetic</b> moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The International Real-time <b>Magnetic</b> Observatory Network, {{with over}} 100 {{interlinked}} geomagnetic observatories {{around the world}} has been recording the earths <b>magnetic</b> field since 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} <b>magnetic</b> fields on liquid crystal {{molecules}} are analogous to electric fields. Because <b>magnetic</b> fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent <b>magnetic</b> dipoles {{are produced by}} electrons moving about atoms. When a <b>magnetic</b> field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|The icy Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced <b>magnetic</b> {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's <b>magnetic</b> field. These varying <b>magnetic</b> moments create dipole <b>magnetic</b> fields around them, which act to compensate {{for changes in the}} ambient field. The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence {{was one of the most}} important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{regions with}} sharp differences in rotation {{are believed to}} be efficient sites for the dynamo processes that generate the stellar <b>magnetic</b> field. There is also a complex interaction between a star's rotation distribution and its <b>magnetic</b> field, with the conversion of <b>magnetic</b> energy into kinetic energy modifying the velocity distribution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>magnetic</b> {{field of}} a star is {{generated}} within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce <b>magnetic</b> fields, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those <b>magnetic</b> fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the <b>magnetic</b> field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} <b>magnetic</b> surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong <b>magnetic</b> fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching <b>magnetic</b> field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same <b>magnetic</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|The metal form is {{slightly}} paramagnetic, meaning its <b>magnetic</b> dipoles align with external <b>magnetic</b> fields, but will assume random orientations once {{the field is}} removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below 7.46K. Below this temperature, technetium has a very high <b>magnetic</b> penetration depth, greater than any other element except niobium.|$|E
5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital <b>magnetic</b> moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net <b>magnetic</b> moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin <b>magnetic</b> moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The <b>magnetic</b> moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The <b>magnetic</b> moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|A <b>magnetic</b> field {{contains}} energy, {{and physical}} systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material {{is placed in}} a <b>magnetic</b> field, a <b>magnetic</b> dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a <b>magnetic</b> field, the <b>magnetic</b> dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the <b>magnetic</b> domains.|$|E
25|$|Spin <b>magnetic</b> {{moments of}} {{elementary}} particles. The <b>magnetic</b> {{moments of the}} nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons' <b>magnetic</b> moments, so they are negligible {{in the context of}} the magnetization of materials. Nuclear <b>magnetic</b> moments are nevertheless very important in other contexts, particularly in nuclear <b>magnetic</b> resonance (NMR) and <b>magnetic</b> resonance imaging (MRI).|$|E
25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied <b>magnetic</b> field, and form internal, induced <b>magnetic</b> fields {{in the direction of the}} applied <b>magnetic</b> field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by <b>magnetic</b> fields and form induced <b>magnetic</b> fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied <b>magnetic</b> field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative <b>magnetic</b> permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility) and hence are attracted to <b>magnetic</b> fields. The <b>magnetic</b> moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> {{earrings}} – <b>Magnetic</b> earrings {{simulate the}} look of a (pierced) stud earring by attaching to the earlobe with a <b>magnetic</b> back that hold the earring in place on by <b>magnetic</b> force.|$|E
25|$|The <b>magnetic</b> {{deflection}} {{is given}} by φ = Hel/mv where φ is the angular <b>magnetic</b> deflection and H is the applied <b>magnetic</b> field intensity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>magnetic</b> {{moments of}} atoms in a {{ferromagnetic}} material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called <b>magnetic</b> domains or Weiss domains. <b>Magnetic</b> domains can be observed with a <b>magnetic</b> force microscope to reveal <b>magnetic</b> domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show <b>magnetic</b> fields.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> Island {{was first}} {{serviced}} in 1899 when a service between Ross Creek and <b>Magnetic</b> Island was commenced by the Hayles <b>Magnetic</b> Island Ferry Service, commenced. As of 2011, Nelly Bay Harbour, <b>Magnetic</b> Island, {{is served by}} 2 companies. SeaLink Travel Group operates passenger catamarans and Fantasea Cruising <b>Magnetic</b> operates a vehicular ferry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> {{hyperthermia}} {{makes use}} of <b>magnetic</b> nanoparticles, which can be injected into tumours and then generate heat when subjected to an alternating <b>magnetic</b> field.|$|E
25|$|Within {{approximately}} ± 20 {{degrees of}} the <b>magnetic</b> equator, is the equatorial anomaly. It is {{the occurrence of}} a trough in the ionization in the F2 layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in <b>magnetic</b> latitude. The Earth's <b>magnetic</b> field lines are horizontal at the <b>magnetic</b> equator. Solar heating and tidal oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the <b>magnetic</b> field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the horizontal <b>magnetic</b> field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the <b>magnetic</b> equator. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} equatorial fountain.|$|E
25|$|A <b>magnetic</b> stripe card {{is a type}} of card {{capable of}} storing data by modifying the {{magnetism}} of tiny iron-based <b>magnetic</b> particles on a band of <b>magnetic</b> material on the card. The <b>magnetic</b> stripe, sometimes called a magstripe, is read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. <b>Magnetic</b> stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards such as a driver's license, and transportation tickets. The <b>magnetic</b> stripe card was invented in 1960 by IBM engineer Forrest Parry, who conceived the idea of incorporating a piece of <b>magnetic</b> tape in order to store secured information and data to a plastic card base.|$|E
25|$|The <b>magnetic</b> field {{strength}} at Saturn's equator is about 21μT (0.21G), which {{corresponds to a}} dipole <b>magnetic</b> moment of about 4.6 T•m3. This makes Saturn's <b>magnetic</b> field slightly weaker than Earth's; however, its <b>magnetic</b> moment is about 580times larger. Saturn's <b>magnetic</b> dipole is strictly aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly axisymmetric. The dipole is slightly shifted (by 0.037Rs) along Saturn's rotational axis towards the north pole.|$|E
25|$|The same {{situations}} that create <b>magnetic</b> fields—charge {{moving in a}} current or in an atom, and intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> dipoles—are also the situations in which a <b>magnetic</b> field has an effect, creating a force. Following is the formula for moving charge; for the forces on an intrinsic dipole, see <b>magnetic</b> dipole.|$|E
