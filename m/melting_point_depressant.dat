40|$|Transient Liquid-Phase Infiltration (TLI) is a {{new method}} for densifying a powder-metal {{skeleton}} that produces a final part of homogeneous composition without significant dimensional change, unlike traditional infiltration and full-density sintering. Fabrication of direct metal parts with complex geometry is possible using TLI in conjunction with Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) processes such as Three-Dimensional Printing, which produce net-shape skeletons of powdered metal directly from CAD models. The infiltrant used in TLI is typically composed of the skeleton material plus a <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> {{in order to facilitate}} homogenization after the liquid metal fills the void space. Parts over 20 cm tall with final compositions of Ni- 4 wt%Si and Ni- 40 wt%Cu were made by TLI from powder skeletons of pure nickel. Tensile tests after HIP treatment compared favorably with cast material of the same composition. A basic understanding of the materials system requirements for TLI and the role of various parameters was developed using nickel-silicon and nickel-copper as test cases. Upon introduction of the liquid infiltrant to the skeleton, the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> begins to diffuse into the skeleton causing isothermal solidification of the infiltrant. This solidification chokes theflow of liquid and can limit the infiltration distance. (cont.) The rate of diffusional solidification was measured via quenching experiments, compared to theory and simulations, and subsequently used to define the change in permeability of the skeleton. For various skeletons of powder sizes ranging from 60 to 300 tm, the infiltration rate was measured via mass increase and compared to the flow model. The predicted horizontal infiltration freeze-off limits were proportional to the square root of d 3 [gamma]/[mu]D[Beta] 2 where d is the average powder diameter, [gamma] and [mu] are the infiltrant surface tension and viscosity, D is the solid diffusivity, and [beta] {{is a function of the}} solidus and liquidus concentrations. These relations can be used for selection of processing parameters and for development of new material systems. by Adam Michael Lorenz. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Wide {{cracks in}} {{land-based}} Ni- or Co-base superalloy turbine components {{are difficult to}} repair successfully using conventional welding or brazing techniques. This project examined the feasibility of liquid phase diffusion brazing using novel Ni- and Co-base braze alloys containing Hf or Zr as <b>melt</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> for the repair of wide cracks in turbine components. An optimized braze cycle was developed and the joints were evaluated using various metallographic techniques and mechanical tests (elevated temperature tensile tests, creep rupture tests and low cycle fatigue tests). Microstructural examination revealed the presence of Hf- or Zr-rich intermetallic phases (most likely Ni 7 Hf 2 or Ni 5 Zr) in Ni-base braze joints. These intermetallic compounds were, however, observed to be significantly softer than the boride phases routinely found in commercially available braze alloys with boron as <b>melt</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant.</b> As a result, the novel wide gap brazed joints displayed excellent mechanical properties (ranging from 80 % to 100 % of the base metal’s properties).

Wide gap braze repair of FSX- 414 Co-base superalloy using novel MarM 509 /MarM 509 B and MarM 509 /Co-Hf braze alloys resulted in high temperature tensile properties equivalent to those of weld repairs in the same parent material (using Nozzalloy filler metal).

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Transient liquid-phase {{diffusion}} brazing {{is used in}} precision, hermetic joining applications {{as a replacement for}} diffusion bonding to reduce cycle times, reduce bonding pressure and improve yields. Studies showed that the interlayer used in {{diffusion brazing}} can be detrimental due to the use of <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressants</b> (MPDs). The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of nanoparticles and their size distribution in reducing bonding temperature of stainless steel surfaces for Microfluidic applications, as nanoparticles have inherently lower <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and higher diffusivity than that of their bulk counterpart. The conventional interlayer has been replaced by a nickel nanoparticle (NiNP) film without any MPDs for diffusion brazing of stainless steel 316 L laminae. Brazing was carried out in a uni-axial vacuum hot press at temperatures 750 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C; at a bonding pressure of 10 MPa; at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and dwell times of 1 and 2 hrs at each temperature. Comparison among the conventionally diffusion bonded, diffusion brazed and NiNP diffusion brazed samples is made with regard to microstructural evolution, diffusional profile and bond strength. Taken together, the results show that NiNP-assisted diffusion brazed samples have continuous bond line with low void fraction and high shear strength compared to conventionally diffusion bonded and brazed samples. Also, comparing within the NiNP diffusion brazed group, the samples brazed at 900 °C have the best results. Effect of particle size on diffusion brazing of stainless steel 316 was also studied with the help of two different sets of nanoparticles (N 1 : average particle size of 46. 7 ± 6. 2 nm and N 2 : average particle size 8. 8 ± 0. 9 nm. Results showed that the sample brazed with 8. 8 nm particles indicated better results with a more homogeneous bondline structure.

40|$|An {{established}} mathematical model, {{describing the}} rate at which transient liquid phase bonding (TLP bonding) progresses in binary alloy systems, is subjected to careful scrutiny. It is shown that the process can be characterised using just two dimensionless parameters. An advantage of such dimensionless characterisation is demonstrated by analysis of the solution for solidification of semi-infinite systems. It is known that analytical formulae for {{the rate at}} which the liquid region solidifies are valid only for certain restricted cases. This is investigated by numerical modelling, and the requirements for the formulae to be applicable are rationalised. Maps presented here can be used to determine whether the semi-infinite solution would provide an acceptable approximation for any given system. Information is also presented concerning optimal combinations of phase diagram characteristics, diffusivities and system dimensions required for rapid TLP solidification, which can be used to identify the best <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (MPD) materials to use for particular TLP requirements.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{temperature}} {{vacuum brazing}} {{has become the}} only appropriate process for thin-walled structures such as compact heat exchangers used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) systems. During the typical brazing process, major attention should {{be paid to the}} isothermal solidification stage which has the most important influence on joint quality. However, the isothermal solidification process is controlled by the diffusion behavior of <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (MPD) elements, and only thorough diffusion of MPD elements into the base metal can result {{in the formation of the}} full solid-solution brazed joints. Therefore, it is significant for brazed joints to accurately obtain the kinetic parameters of diffusion component. In this study, a new type of wedge-shaped brazing specimen was proposed to study the joints properties. The experiments were carried out on the combination of SS 316 L with BNi- 2 filler alloy at 1050, 1075 and 1100 °C with different holding time ranged from 15 to 45 min, respectively. Two classical models coupled with experimental data have been used to determine the kinetic parameters, including diffusion coefficient and diffusion activity energy. Then the effects of the brazing temperature and holding time on the maximum brazing clearance (MBC) value are also investigated. The results show that the diffusion coefficient increases with the increase of temperature and decreases with the increase of holding time at constant temperature. The diffusion activity energy of boron in SS 316 L is 134 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, significant augment of the MBC value has also been observed with increase in brazing temperature and holding time...|$|E

Inconel 617 is a solid solution, Ni-Cr-Co-Mo alloy with an exceptional combination of high temperature strength, oxidation and carburization resistance and thermal stability. Two types of interlayer compositions for the TLP bonding process were selected. Specifically, boron containing (AWS BNi- 3) and phosphorus rich (AWS BNi- 6) were employed as <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (MPD) elements. Process parameters such as bonding temperature, holding time, composition and thickness of interlayer were selected for study. Two bonding temperatures, 1065 °C and 1150 °C, and two interlayer thicknesses with various holding times ranging from 5 minutes to 24 hours were selected. Joints were fabricated using Inconel 617 specimens measuring 25 mm long, 5 mm wide and 1 mm thick. A tube furnace under vacuum (1 x 10 - 5 mbar) was used {{to carry out the}} experiments. The specimens were fixed with stainless steel fixture and held at the bonding temperature for the selected times. Optical microscopy, SEM, FEG-SEM, VP-SEM were used to follow microstructure evolution and identify its constituents.

40|$|Diffusion Brazing (DB) of nickel-based {{superalloys}} is {{a standard}} joining process widely used in gas turbine industry. The DB technique uses a low melting nickel-based filler material, which contains a rapidly diffusing <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (MPD) such as boron. Upon brazing, the braze filler firstly melts and then solidifies isothermally through the diffusion of boron from the liquid braze alloy into the solid parent material. Fully isothermally solidified joints exhibit a brittle-phase free microstructure and show excellent mechanical properties. The kinetics of the DB process are controlled by the "effective MPD flux" from the liquid into the surrounding bulk material. The effective MPD flux {{is a function of}} the boron diffusion rates and thermodynamic parameters of the parent materials such as the MPD solubility. In the case of brazing superalloys, the complex interactions between the braze filler and the parent material are not fully understood with regard to thermodynamic parameters that control the effective MPD flux. In the present work, the DB process applied to a single crystal multi-component superalloy is studied by combining experimental and numerical modelling results. A representative superalloy/braze filler system has been selected, namely CMSX- 4 /D- 15. The main task consisted of studying the thermodynamic parameters that control the effective MPD (boron) flux into the parent superalloy. Boron diffusion into the superalloy material causes the formation of borides due to the low solubility of the matrix phase for boron and the presence of boride forming elements such as Cr, W and Mo. Boron is therefore steadily consumed from the superalloy matrix phase during isothermal solidification by in-situ boride precipitation. As a consequence, the effective boron flux into the parent material is increased. The overall boron content in the parent superalloy is higher than the boron solubility limit would allow. It has been found that there exists an optimum brazing temperature at which the effective boron flux into the CMSX- 4 material due to boride formation is highest. With an increase in the brazing temperature the volume fraction of borides that are stable in the parent material steadily decreases. Above the optimum brazing temperature, the effect of boride formation on the effective boron flux into the superalloy material is low. The DB process is then mainly controlled by the low boron solubility in the matrix phase. The results regarding the effective boron flux and an optimum brazing temperature can be applied to most superalloy systems as most superalloys contain boride forming elements. The present work supports generally the selection of appropriate brazing cycles for the diffusion brazing of superalloys...|$|E
40|$|Large gap joints are {{frequently}} {{encountered in the}} manufacturing of massive components {{as well as in}} the repairing of damaged parts. Several methods using powder interlayers to produce large clearance transient liquid phase (TLP) joints have been developed and investigated in this work. One of the methods was using a mixture of powders of the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (MPD) and the base material, from which a great amount of MPD (> 30 vol. %) usually has to be used to eliminate residual porosity. To reduce the MPD in the joint, the liquid infiltrated powder interlayer bonding (LIPB) process was developed. For a material system that has a large mutual solubility between the liquid and the solid at the bonding temperature, a protective coating on the particles of the base material was applied to avoid excessive dissolution and inhibit early diffusional solidification, which can block the infiltration paths and prevent full infiltration. Direct coating of the MPD on the particles of the base material proved highly effective in producing tough and strong joints for certain material systems. The classic liquid phase sintering (LPS) theory was adopted to explain the physical process as occurring in the powder interlayer during joining. Despite the general applicability of the theory, there are several other important factors have to be considered as well. For example, the reaction rate between the MPD and the base material can markedly affect the densification of a mixed powder interlayer. Fast growth of the intermetallic compounds as a result of reaction can significantly retard the liquid flow. For the infiltration process, kinetics of dissolution and diffusional solidification largely depend on the mutual solubility between the liquid (infiltrant) and the solid (powder interlayer). Dissolution is needed to open up closed pores in the powder interlayer. However, excessive dissolution is undesirable due to fast liquid saturation and subsequent diffusional solidification, which may prevent complete infiltration of the interlayer. A protective coating on the particles of the base material provides a way of reducing the dissolution rate, which facilitates full infiltration of the interlayer. The solubility factor is also crucial for direct coating of the MPD on the particles of the base material. Higher solubility of the base material in the MPD is preferred to maintain enough liquid for complete densification. Experiments were performed on joining the materials including titanium alloy, Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V, nickel base superalloy, Inconel 625, stainless steel, SS 304, and commercially pure copper. Application of the particular joining process depends on careful choice of the MPD, the base powders as well as the geometry of the interlayers. by Wei-Dong Zhuang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Both {{aviation}} {{and land}} based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs {{can help reduce}} overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX- 414 or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN 738. The nominal compositions of FSX- 414 and IN 738 are Co- 29. 5 Cr- 10. 5 Ni- 7 W- 2 Fe [max]- 0. 25 C- 0. 012 B and Ni- 0. 001 B- 0. 17 C- 8. 5 Co- 16 Cr- 1. 7 Mo- 3. 4 Al- 2. 6 W- 1. 7 Ta- 2 Nb- 3. 4 Ti- 0. 1 Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing {{has been used for}} over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni- and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that affect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0. 15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0. 15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopies, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure with carbide phases, gamma dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma prime - eutectic phases, and Ni 7 Hf 2, Ni 5 HF, or Ni 5 Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250 - 400 HV, whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 HV to 1000 HV. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2. 5 - 3. 2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture test from 760 °C to 1093 °C, and finally LCF tests, the latter being {{one of the most important}} and severe tests to conduct since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80 % and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metal properties...|$|E

Three new comb-shaped copolymers of maleic anhydride and n-alkyl oleate were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization, which were consequently reacted with hexadecyl amine to get poly (hexyl oleate-co-hexadecyl maleimide-co-n-alkyl oleate). Synthesized polymers were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). These FIs were further evaluated for their pour point depression property and rheology modifier with and without additive using Fann Viscometer. The prepared FIs act as effective pour <b>point</b> <b>depressants</b> as well as viscosity index improvers...|$|R
25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> increases in the series isopentane −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> but the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high <b>melting</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
