However when the solutions are used to produce ready-to-inject technetium- 99 m high levels of technetium- 99 are present at the time of calibration which is the day after the collection date. Where sensitive reagent kits are to be labelled freshly collected solutions of technetium- 99 m should be used. The HPLC assay is a valuable technique for the quality control of technetium-based radiopharmaceuticals and for investigation <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> technetium- 99 m.

25|$|The {{twist drill}} bit {{was invented by}} Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861. The {{original}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes {{in the same manner}} as cutting helical gears.|$|E
25|$|Artifacts made of arsenical bronze {{cover the}} {{complete}} spectrum of metal objects, from axes to ornaments. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> involved heating the metal in crucibles and casting it into moulds {{made of stone}} or clay. After solidifying it would be polished {{or in the case}} of axes and other tools work-hardened by beating the working edge with a hammer, thinning out the metal and increasing its strength. Finished objects could also be engraved or decorated as appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Gelatin readily dissolves in {{hot water}} and sets to a gel on cooling. When added {{directly}} to cold water, it does not dissolve well, however.

25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of charcoal in terra preta soils {{is characterized by}} poly-condensed aromatic groups, that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature loses that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and {{on the surface of}} the black carbon particles, there are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

It was manufacturered from 1961, and 80% of the world's glass {{is made with}} the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world's first {{registered}} brand, and world's oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the arc lamp. Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought {{to make the best}} quality rail track in the world.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, the UK's Tizard Mission {{visited the}} US Army and Navy {{departments}} {{and part of}} the information handed over included details of the [...] "Woolwich" [...] <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> of RDX and its stabilisation by mixing it with beeswax. The UK was asking that the US and Canada, combined, supply [...] (440,000lb) of RDX per day. A decision was taken by William H. P. Blandy, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance to adopt RDX for use in mines and torpedoes. Given the immediate need for RDX, the US Army Ordnance, at Blandy's request, built a plant that just copied the equipment and process used at Woolwich. The result was the Wabash River Ordnance Works run by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. At that time, this works had the largest nitric acid plant in the world. The Woolwich process was expensive; it needed [...] of strong nitric acid for every pound of RDX.|$|E
2500|$|Two of the {{few places}} where condoms became more {{restricted}} during this period were Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Because of government concern about low birth rates, contraceptives were made illegal in Italy in the late 1920s. Although limited and highly controlled sales as disease preventatives were still allowed, there was a brisk black market trade in condoms as birth control. [...] In Germany, laws passed in 1933 mandated that condoms could only be sold in plain brown wrappers, and only at pharmacies. Despite these restrictions, when World War II began Germans were using 72 million condoms every year. [...] The elimination of moral and legal barriers, and the introduction of condom programs by the U.S. government helped condom sales. However, these factors alone are not considered to explain the Great Depression's booming condom industry. In the U.S. alone, more than 1.5 million condoms were used every day during the Depression, at a cost of over $33 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). One historian explains these statistics this way: [...] "Condoms were cheaper than children." [...] During the Depression condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity: that company still used the cement-dipping <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> Unlike the latex variety, these condoms could be safely used with oil-based lubricants. And while less comfortable, older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.|$|E
