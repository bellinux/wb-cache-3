25|$|The breast is {{susceptible}} to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are puerperal mastitis, fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia. Lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as galactorrhea (spontaneous <b>milk</b> <b>flow)</b> from the adverse effects of drugs (e.g. antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress, or endocrine disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation {{is a consequence of}} the mother's circulating hormones (prolactin, oxytocin, etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady <b>milk</b> <b>flow.</b> Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.|$|E

25|$|It can {{be harmful}} to an animal {{for it to be}} over-milked past the point where the udder has stopped {{releasing}} milk. Consequently, the milking process involves not just applying the milker, but also monitoring the process to determine when the animal has been milked out and the milker should be removed. While parlor operations allowed a farmer to milk many more animals much more quickly, it also increased the number of animals to be monitored simultaneously by the farmer. The automatic take-off system was developed to remove the milker from the cow when the <b>milk</b> <b>flow</b> reaches a preset level, relieving the farmer of the duties of carefully watching over 20 or more animals being milked at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{breast-feeding}} difficulties {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common if the incisions cut tissue near the nipple. The milk glands {{are most likely to}} be affected by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede <b>milk</b> <b>flow.</b> Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, it is impossible to predict whether a woman who undergoes breast augmentation will be able to successfully breast feed since some women are able to breast-fed after periareolarincisions and subglandular placement and some are not able to after augmentation using submuscular and other types of surgical incisions.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{breast-feeding}} difficulties {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other implantation incision-plansIMF (inframammary fold), TABA (Trans-Axillary Breast Augmentation), TUBA (trans-umbilical breast augmentation)avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the woman is concerned about possible breast-feeding difficulties, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede <b>milk</b> <b>flow.</b> Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: A high milk production, time limited milking {{and healthy}} udders are priority tasks at milking farms. The aim {{of our research}} was to study how different ways of keeping (free rang and tying) and milking (milking parlour, bucket machine and pipeline milking) influence on the mentioned cattle characteristics. Investigation was conducted at four milking farms and 382 Holstein cows in eastern Croatia. The variance analysis has shown significant difference (P< 0, 05) among researched farms for the milk yield per milking (MYM), the somatic cell count (LSCC) and the maximum <b>milk</b> <b>flowing</b> rate (MFR). Farms at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables had more problems with udder health than farms at which milking was conducted at milking places. Also at these farms (at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables) the maximum <b>milk</b> <b>flowing</b> rate was uneven, what was caused by uneven vacuum and obsoletes milking equipment. Keeping cows free at the stable and milking at a milking place have appeared to be more appropriate for cow’s udder health, what finally influences a higher milking production. Such farms should be the future of modern milking production in Croatia. Key words: milk yield, somatic cell count, <b>milk</b> <b>flowing</b> rate, <b>milking</b> metho...|$|R

2500|$|Erotic Lactation between {{partners}} or an Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR) {{may develop}} from natural breastfeeding of a baby.

2500|$|To prevent [...] {{or treat}} engorgement, remove the milk from the breast, by breastfeeding, expressing or pumping.

2500|$|The Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk {{notes that}} milk {{pasteurization}} {{is designed to}} achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii. [...] The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the <b>milk</b> <b>flow</b> in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high.” [...] The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.|$|E
