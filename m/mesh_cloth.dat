50|$|Before {{the advent}} of roller milling, {{virtually}} all wheat was milled by stone grinding. In order to produce a lighter, less chewy bread, the whole wheat flour was sifted or bolted using <b>mesh</b> or <b>cloth.</b> This resulted in a whiter flour that still retained some of the bran and germ. The addition of rye flour in some recipes probably originates from the presence of rye growing among the wheat. All the grain was harvested together, {{and as much as}} 10 percent of it would be rye. Rye flour ferments more quickly than wheat flour, and it imparts a distinctive flavor to traditional pains de campagne.|$|R

A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R

40|$|Shape {{as well as}} {{force is}} {{required}} to represent the cloth in virtual environment. A model, based on the cost functions, realizes the shape together with force by using physical data obtained from Kawabata Evaluation System. However, cost/ energy minimization technique is very slow that restricts the increase of mesh density. Some of previous work has employed the adaptive refinement in this regard. However, mesh simplification is not considered. We propose a method, which proceeds in the reverse direction of refinement. Simulation starts with denser <b>mesh</b> of <b>cloth</b> and <b>mesh</b> density is reduced adaptively during simulation, which we say the `Adaptive Coarsening'. This paper describes the comparison between adaptive refinement and adaptive coarsening. We found that adaptive coarsening is comparatively better in terms of speed and quality for cloth simulation...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) A {{challenge}} faced when simulating {{the complex}} behaviour of cloth, especially at interactive frame rates, is maintaining {{an acceptable level}} of realism while keeping computation time to a minimum. A common method used to increase the performance is to decrease the number of nodes controlling the cloth's movement. This results in {{a significant decrease in}} the time taken to calculate each frame of the animation, but at the cost of sacrificing detail that can only be obtained using a dense discretisation of the cloth. A simple, efficient and popular method to simulate cloth is the mass-spring system, which utilises a regular grid of vertices representing discrete points along the cloth's surface. The structure of geometry images is similar, which makes them an ideal choice for representing arbitrary surface <b>meshes</b> in a <b>cloth</b> simulator whilst retaining the effciency of a mass-spring system. This dissertation presents a novel method of applying geometry images to cloth simulation in order to obtain cloth motion for surface meshes while retaining the simplicity of a massspring model. By adapting an implicit/explicit integration scheme, and utilising the regular structure of geometry images, an improvement in performance is achieved. Additionally, the cloth is able to drape over other objects, also represented as geometry images. The proposed method is efficient enough to allow fairly dense <b>cloth</b> <b>meshes</b> to be simulated in real-time...|$|R

Perhaps the most common for home growers is sprouting in a jar with a fine <b>mesh</b> or muslin <b>cloth</b> tied over the top with a rubber band or string. Fresh water is then added three to four times a day and bottles are left upturned to drain. What technique to use depends on the amount that one wants to collect. The main principles are: selecting good seed (new and uniform), ensuring that light reaches the seeds and also ensuring they receive enough humidity, but avoid water content.|$|R

40|$|The {{surfaces}} {{used for}} investigating nucleate pool boiling for four working fluids had mini- and micro-fins of variable configurations, cross-sections and pitches, restrained by perforated foil or <b>mesh</b> <b>cloth</b> with various pore/opening diameters.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ratio of}} wind to insect pollination of five alpine-arctic Salix species and possible correlations between plant traits and this ratio. The field work was done in an alpine area in southwest Norway, at an elevation of 1250 m. Female catkins were enclosed within <b>mesh</b> <b>cloth</b> to prevent insect visitation, and their fruit set was determined and {{compared with that of}} open-pollinated control catkins. Simultaneously, pollen production per anther, pollen dispersal, standing crop of nectar, flower length, number of flowers per catkin, and catkin length were measured. The amount of wind pollination of the species varied from 2 to 52 %. All species spread pollen in the air. Nectar content, catkin length, flower number, and flower length showed a negative relationship with the percentage of wind pollination. Significant negative linear correlations between female catkin length and flower length and amount of wind pollination were detected. Pollen production per anther did not show any relationship to the pollination system. We suggest that the evolution to insect pollination in alpine Salix species may have resulted in a lengthening of anthers and pistils, and an increase in nectar production...|$|E
50|$|Separating the bran {{and other}} parts of the grain from the desired flour was {{historically}} a difficult and time-consuming process to carry out manually. Efforts to automate the process began early on. Edmund Brunt filed a provisional patent on a 'bolting machine' in 1614. John Milne patented a machine in 1765 which used several grades of wire <b>mesh</b> or <b>cloth</b> to separate flour from bran. A machine for manufacturing bolting cloth, used to filter the flour from bran {{and other parts}} of the grain, was patented in 1783 by Benjamin Blackmore. And in 1850, James Bell devised a means of separating flour by pushing the feedstock (or 'stock') against a vertical cloth ('bolting sleeve') while Joseph Foot patented a means of making the filter sleeve from silk instead of wool. Development continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, increasing the speed and efficiency of the process through improvements such as the addition of beaters and brushes to force the fine flour through the filters and to continuously clean the filters as they rotated.|$|R
