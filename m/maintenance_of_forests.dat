40|$|Forestry - {{including}} afforestation (the {{planting of}} trees on land {{where they have}} not recently existed), reforestation, avoided deforestation, and forest management - can lead to increased sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and has therefore been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change. However, forestry also influences land-surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmosphere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counteracting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate-change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways in which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions, and highlight knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection. We also outline several ways in which biophysical effects {{can be incorporated into}} frameworks that use the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> as a climate protection strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} patterns, {{the ecological}} {{structure and the}} typical species of the orthopteran assemblage in the Dadia reserve are investigated. The reserve was {{designed to protect the}} black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and other raptors. A total of 39 orthopteran species were found, including Paranocarodes chopardi, a pamphagid species with very restricted distribution. All species can be represented in a network of six complementary habitats, including open oak woodlands, agricultural fields separated with hedges, humid grasslands, as well as serpentine grasslands. The buffer zone of the reserve is far more important for Orthoptera conservation than the core areas, which host most of the black vulture nests. Management focusing on raptors is in general compatible with conservation of Orthoptera. We suggest the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> openings in the buffer zone, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> heterogeneity, the enhancement of periodical livestock grazing, and the use of nine indicator species and Paranocarodes chopardi in the reserve monitoring program.

This decrease is associated with the evasion of the agricultural areas that happened in nine cities of the Basin.

The reference level was established using LiDAR–Assisted Multisource Programme (LAMP), an innovative effort that utilizes existing national forest and survey data, field sampling, satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR data to measure deforestation and forest degradation, regrowth and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests,</b> and the resulting emissions and sequestration of CO 2 in the project districts for the period 1999 – 2011. This effort was designed to create a sub-national RL that meets the highest international standards for integrity and transparency and followed closely the guidelines of the Methodological Framework (MF) defined by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) at the World Bank and Guidelines defined by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The present analysis shows that during the 12 -year period between 1999 and 2011 a net total of 52, 245, 991 tons CO 2 (tCO 2 e) was emitted from the forest sector in the TAL, an average emission of 4, 353, 833 tons CO 2 e per year.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding of}} the impact of air pollution and other environmental factors on forest ecosystems, a Pan-European Programme for Intensive and Continuous Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems has been implemented in 1994. Results of the Programme must contribute to a European wide overview of impacts of air pollution and the further development of its control strategies, being described in air pollution protocols. Objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme related toair pollution are the assessment of: (i) responses of forest ecosystems to changes in air pollution; (ii) differences between present loads and critical loads (long-term sustainable inputs) of atmospheric deposition; and (iii) impacts of future scenariosof atmospheric deposition on the ecosystem condition. Furthermore, the Intensive Monitoring Programme contributes to the assessment of `criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management', such as the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> as a net carbon sink toreduce the build up of atmospheric greenhouse gasses and the maintenance of species diversity of ground vegetation. The Intensive Monitoring Programme, which is carried out on approximately 860 selected plots, comprises monitoring of crown condition, forest growth and the chemical status of soil and foliage at all plots and monitoring of deposition, meteorology, soil solution and ground vegetation in a subset of the plots. In order to meet the major objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme, studies have been or are presently carried out with respect to the assessment of: (i) correlations between site and stress factors and the "forest ecosystem condition"; (ii) trends in stress factors and/or ecosystem conditions; (iii) critical loads, by evaluating the fate of atmospheric pollutants in the ecosystem with input-output budgets; and (iv) large-scale and long-term impacts of climate and deposition on forests and vice versa.

By controlling the presence of two bird species, great tits (Parus major; foliage gleaner) and nuthatches (Sitta europaea; trunk gleaner), in the enclosures, their effect on predatory insects (ants), herbivorous insects (Lepidoptera larvae) and producers (oak trees) was quantified. Great tits reduced the density of Lepidoptera larvae and, indirectly, leaf damage, but had no impact on ants. Nuthatches decreased the density of ants but did not influence either Lepidoptera larvae or leaf damage.

50|$|Puriri is an {{invaluable}} food source for native wildlife, as it provides both fruit and nectar in seasons when few other species produce these, {{thus it is}} often used in restoration planting, e.g. the Elvie McGregor Reserve between Waipoua Forest and Katui Scenic Reserve in Northland and on Tiritiri Matangi Island in the Hauraki Gulf. It is hoped that restoration planting, with trees such as puriri, will provide a year round food source for birds, boosting their populations. For example, puriri is highly valued as an aid in increasing kereru (native pigeon) populations. Maintaining kereru populations is particularly important for natural restoration and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> remnants, as this bird is the main disperser of large fruited species.|$|R

30|$|Compared with Fennoscandia, where forests {{have been}} {{in one way or}} other {{utilised}} for centuries and a large share <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> are under their second intensive rotation, in north-eastern Canada harvesting is still mostly taking place in natural forest in the north.

The harvested natural forest also has structural legacies such as dead wood pools which only slowly start decaying away after first cutting. Overall, this means that the forests under management in north-eastern Canada currently have more natural legacies left in the forest as compared to Fennoscandia (e.g. dead wood) and that there is still a potential for proactive design <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> landscapes and protection area networks based on current scientific knowledge and considering anticipated climate change effects on species range shifts.|$|R
