5|$|As for The Five, {{the group}} had long since dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had {{followed}} in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was seen by the composer as <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants {{felt that this}} was <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, The Orcadian {{newspaper}} {{reported that a}} strange creature had been seen {{off the coast of}} Shapinsay.

5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> formality.|$|E

BBC Audio released a DVD version of the Tertiary Phase, featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006. Contrary to previous announcements, this was <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> DVD-Video disc with Dolby Digital sound and other features, rather than a DVD-Audio disc.

5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> joke.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> test.

Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> {{limiting case}} of (special) relativistic mechanics.

(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincar√© group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
