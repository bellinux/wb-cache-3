In the context of producing reliable proofs, the question how to ensure correctness when integrating a computer algebra <b>system</b> into a <b>mechanised</b> reasoning <b>system</b> is crucial. In this contribution, we discuss the correctness problems that arise from such anintegration and advocate an approach in which the calculations of the computer algebra system are checked at the calculus level of the <b>mechanised</b> reasoning <b>system.</b> We present an implementation which achieves this by adding a verbose mode to the computer algebra system which produces high-level protocol {{information that can be}} processed by aninterface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in turn can be expanded to proofs at di erent levels of abstraction, so the approach iswell-suited for producing a high-level verbalised explication as well as for a low-level (machine checkable) calculus-level proof. ...|$|R

40|$|At least 200, 000 m 3 {{of timber}} are {{harvested}} annually using semi-mechanised harvesting systems (SMS) on the Viphya forest plantations in Malawi. Although these systems {{have long been}} used on the Viphya, no investigation on their productivity {{has so far been}} reported. The absence of local productivity models created uncertainty about the importance of sitebased factors that influence timber harvesting productivity of these systems on the Viphya. Secondly, there is paucity of information regarding the appropriate timber harvesting systems for production maximisation and cost minimisation. This study aimed to develop prediction models for estimating the productivity and costs of semi-mechanised and simulated mechanised timber harvesting systems on the Viphya forest plantations. The study was conducted in Pinus kesiya stands at Kalungulu and Champhoyo forest stations of the Viphya forest plantations. A work study approach was followed to capture harvesting time and volume data. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to develop felling time models for a chainsaw over tree size, inter-tree distance, slope, ground condition, brush density, and ground roughness; and skidding time models over distance, slope, ground condition, ground roughness and volume skidded per cycle for a grapple skidder. Models were statistically validated. Secondary work study data for semi-mechanised systems were simulated for mechanised productivity based on local site factors. The study had shown that diameter at breast height and inter-tree distance were important factors that best explained felling time prediction models in Pinus kesiya stands on the Viphya forest plantations. Similarly, distance from stump to the roadside landing was {{the most important factor in}} addition to volume load, slope and ground conditions that determined grapple skidding time. <b>Mechanised</b> <b>systems</b> appear to be more advantageous than semi-mechanised systems. The former are associated with lower operating costs and inventories with relatively high production rates.

The thinning was applied with selection criteria, removing between 36 and 39 % of the tree number. The frequency of tree wounding was 1. 5 and 5 %, respectively for the mechanised and the motor-manual treatment. Wounds inflicted by the <b>mechanised</b> <b>system</b> were also four times smaller than those inflicted by the motor-manual system. The superior performance of the <b>mechanised</b> <b>system</b> was ascribed to its better capacity for handling cut trees. Soil bulk density increased by 3 % and 6 % after motor-manual and mechanised harvesting, respectively. The increase was small but significant, whereas the difference between treatments was not significant. Machine traffic resulted in a significant increase of CO 2 concentration in the soil air, which was 0. 4 % in the undisturbed control plots and 0. 8 % in the machine tracks. No {{significant difference was found}} between the treatments. The CO 2 concentration in the machine tracks was very near to the 1 % critical threshold, beyond which biological activity is so constrained that soil recovery may be significantly delayed. When repeated entries are necessary, it is best to avoid creating new tracks by restricting traffic to designated permanent tracks. Properly applied mechanised harvesting does not cause heavier soil impacts than traditional motor-manual harvesting, but it results in a much lower stand damage.

30|$|The thesis {{states that}} linking diverse {{subsystems}} {{which have been}} carried out in the field of education and induced by evidence-based governance has been made possible by technological advances. These have taken place through the implementation of new governance mechanisms. While the scientific system is mechanised through “certain methods” [45 : 70], the political system is mechanised, among other things, through the return to technocracy [46]. In the education system, the complex forms of the new governance model are being imposed on education to revise the interaction mechanisms on the organisational and system’s level that have been deemed deficient [47]. If {{it is true that the}} aforementioned functional systems are becoming mechanised, the structural linking will ensure that relevant information will be translated quickly and appropriately from code to code. Could trust and mistrust in the mechanisms be seen as a quasi-universal communication code through which <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems</b> are linked to one another? Weingart [27] takes a similar stance with his view: the (side-) effects of linkages in the science system are actually changes in the mechanism of self-control and legitimization. These undermine the originally existing trust and, as a consequence, demand external agents in order to regain the damaged trust [ibid.: 32]. This process is regarded as the establishment of control systems and mechanisms. These forms of social mechanisation generate information which, seen from a system-specific point of view, is being used as knowledge for regulative purposes. However, when these mechanisms generate information they also depend on the trust of all relevant parties.|$|E

PG Bison’s North East Cape Forests (NECF), Eastern Cape operations and Komatiland Forests (KLF), Mpumalanga operations were studied. The main aim {{of the study was}} to carry out an ergonomic assessment on local forwarder operator tasks, using Tigercat 1055 forwarders. The study specifically assessed WMSD prevalence and risk factors, investigated the frequency of awkward head postures and evaluated work organisation. A modified Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire was used to survey WMSD prevalence and work organisation factors. Operators reported hourly, localised work-related musculoskeletal discomfort experienced during the shift. A video camera mounted in the cab was used to capture footage of awkward head postures. The video footage was also used for the WMSD risk assessment using the Health and Safety Executive (HSG 60) upper limb disorder assessment worksheets. Operators reported having experienced WMSD’s during the last 12 months mainly in the lower back, neck, shoulders and upper back. The studied operators reported lower repetition strain symptoms and higher lower back disorders than in previous studies. Twenty three percent of the awkward head postures adopted were extreme. The study results support the assertion that causal pathways of WMSD’s are complex and multifactorial.

40|$|Abstract. Adverse service {{conditions}} and malfunction of shoe brakes can induce dangerous tensile stresses {{in the rim}} of railway wheels. Solid wheels for freight cars are subject to “rim chilling ” to induce compressive stresses in the rim; such stresses are beneficial to the wheel safety as they avoid the sudden propagation of potentially evolving defects. Non destructive measurement of residual stresses in a wheel rim is carried by ultrasounds, via the acoustic birefringence effect. The test detects the anisotropy induced by the residual stresses, from the speed of two shear waves with cross polarization. The method was set as a standard for re-qualification of used wheels (UIC 510 - 5) and accepted as a quality test for evaluation of 100 % production (European standard EN 13262 : 2004). The paper shows a solution developed for stress testing by a non-contact EMAT probe embedding two superimposed sensors that generate shear ultrasonic waves with cross polarization, thus providing the required measures without probe rotation. The dedicated electronic hardware is suited to implement manual or automated test applications. The accurate and reliable measure of wave travel time enables residual stress evaluation accuracies up to 10 MPa in lab conditions. The system has been improved to meet increasingly requirements on test speed, flexibility, and error detection without operator intervention. A mechanical rig with a motorised actuator has been developed to ensure scan and stress tests in a portable set-up.

Within the environment of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with the group of eight index languages which used single terms. The group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance, while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary. Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance. The use of precision devices such as links gave no advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination. All results have to be considered {{within the context of the}} experimental environment, but they can be said to substantiate or clarify many of the findings of Cranfield I. It is conclusively shown that an inverse relationship exists between recall and precision, whatever the variable may be that is being changed. The two factors which appear most likely to affect performance are the level of exhaustivity of indexing and the level of specificity of the terms in the index language. For any given operational situation, the optimum levels cannot be categorically stated in advance, but can only be determined by an evaluation of the system, the main consideration probably being the subject field.

40|$|The {{commitments}} to sustainable development {{made by the}} member countries of the UN, together with the Kyoto Protocol, has raised the profile of {{issues related to the}} ecological evaluation of products, production processes and services. In each of the studies underlying this thesis a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) perspective was adopted. Firstly, site-specific data were collected from three forest management regions in northern, central and southern Sweden in the late 1990 s. Secondly, silvicultural and technological forestry developments between the early 1970 s and late 1990 s were evaluated by comparing the energy use in the forestry system at each of these times. Secondary transport of timber was found to be the most energy-demanding part of the forestry system usually, accounting for about 50 percent of the energy demands, and logging was generally the second most energy-demanding process (33 - 40 percent), except in systems involving mechanized logging operations in 1972, when logging required the most energy (60 percent). These findings show that increased mechanization since 1972 has not resulted in a rise in total energy use; in fact, it has led to more energy-efficient logging machines, from motor-manual and early <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems,</b> to current machines that {{are on the verge of}} automisation. In contrast, energy use in silviculture has increased, possibly due to the use of more supposedly advanced technology and more intensive silvicultural treatments. The same is also true for secondary haulage because of the greater use of road vehicles and longer haulage distances. An analyse of future possible secondary timber transport scenarios involving lorry or lorry-and-train combinations using a variety of potential fuels/energy carriers showed that in biobased-fuel cycles the greenhouse gas emissions are about 96 percent lower than in corresponding fossil fuel cycles.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of large-scale computing technology into British high street banking in the 1960 s was {{a solution to}} shortages of space and staff. Computers required a first-time dislocation of customer accounting from its confines in the branch, {{where it had been}} dealt with by paper-based and <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems,</b> to a new space: the bank computer centre. The implications of this shift have, up until now, not been explored. While historians of business and technology have stressed the continuities between computerisation, punched-card machines, and centralised work, the demands of the computer on decentralised business activities have received little attention. This thesis addresses that shortcoming. The main vehicle for my analysis is a case study of Barclays Bank. I begin in 1954, when the bank took its initial steps towards branch computerisation, and end twenty years later, when the last of its branches was connected to the system. Blending oral testimonies with visual and written sources, I follow activities inside and outside the computer centre to consider the relationship between computers, business, space and work as the material and discursive aspects of computing technology are connected to existing banking practice. I contend that while computers did not appear to achieve the quantitative changes in staffing and space that the banks initially desired, there were qualitative effects that reveal different dimensions to technological change. I demonstrate how the computer centre was constructed as an iconic symbol of modernity to project a new organisational identity for the banks; how technology’s materiality changed the look of banking and signalled the approach of “Americanisation”; how the computer could provide opportunities both for learning and for expensive failure; and how the computer centre was a place that reconfigured temporal, occupational and organisational structures to become a nexus of new careers for bank workers turned computer specialists. The result is an analysis of computing use that moves beyond simple causal connections between computers, space and work to highlight the reciprocal and changing nature of their relationships.

40|$|Existing date {{harvesting}} machines are {{vehicles equipped with}} a long arm to lift {{a man on a}} platform to harvest the fruits. The arm and the vehicle are heavy (4 to 8 tonnes), expensive (from £ 16 000) and are not sufficiently manoeuvrable in constricted date groves. Most dates in the main producing countries, including Iran, are therefore harvested manually. The manual method is unsafe, slow, expensive (£ 0. 63 per tree) and the fruit quality is often damaged. A light, weight 4 wheel drive, remotely controlled tree climbing machine is, therefore, a potential solution to the problems of harvesting and servicing (such as pollinating and pruning). A prototype of such a device was designed, developed and evaluated under laboratory conditions. To determine the operating characteristics and feasibility the machine was designed to climb the tree using pneumatic tyres as traction wheels. The machine can be transformed to ground drive and move between trees under its own power. This approach reduces the machine weight, cost and size because the tree trunk is used as a support for the machine to climb to the fruits. It is operated and controlled from the ground which improves the operator safety. A vertical traction theory for this type of machine has been developed based on the tree size and surface characteristics and machine size and weight which can be used to design date harvesting and climbing machines with different capacities. The test results showed that the experimental machine could achieve a tractive efficiency of 90 % and that the optimum wheel slippage was between 10 - 15 %. The machine consumes a maximum of 1. 4 kW power which is only 3 % of the power requirement of existing systems. The machine weight is 150 kg which is 2 - 4 % of the existing systems' weight. It is capable of climbing the tree at a maximum speed of 0. 27 m/s although the optimum speed is 0. 17 m/s for best control. The prototype can carry a payload of 100 kg of dates and, considering a field efficiency of 75 %, it can potentially harvest a tree in 22 minutes which is 18 % faster than the manual system in Iran and 6 % faster than one of the <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems</b> used in Saudi Arabia. The harvester can work on tree diameter ranges from 300 to 850 mm and can pass over the tree leaf bases of 41 mm high. The machine should not damage the tree because the tree resists the machine stresses with a minimum safety factor of 7. An economic analysis showed that it can be manufactured in Iran at 20 % of the cost of existing systems. The machine cost per tree is equal to the hand harvesting method (£O. 63 per tree) for Iranian farmers if it harvests 978 trees per year...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{agricultural}} soils may determine soil carbon emission {{to the atmosphere}} (source) or soil carbon sequestration (sink). Conventional agriculture is tillage-based (TA) in industrialised as well as developing countries and relies, as a key procedure for seedbed preparation, on mechanical soil tillage with no organic mulch cover. Generally, it seems {{to speed up the}} loss of Soil Organic Matter (SOM), by increasing its mineralization and through soil loss by erosion. In addition, soil tillage is a high energy-consuming operation that uses large amounts of fossil fuel per hectare in <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems.</b> In contrast to tillage-based systems, Conservation Agriculture (CA) is considered to be an agro-ecological approach to resource-conserving agricultural production that requires compliance with three linked practical principles, namely: i) minimum mechanical soil disturbance (with no-till and direct seeding); ii) maintenance of permanent organic soil cover (with crops, cover crops and/or crop residues); and iii) species diversification through crop rotations and associations (involving annual and/or perennial crops including tree and pasture crops) Corsi et al. (2012). CA facilitates good agronomy, such as timely operations, and improves overall land husbandry for rained and irrigated production and is complemented by other good practices, {{such as the use of}} quality seeds and integrated pest management (Pisante et al., 2012). There is evidence that, in the medium term, the most effective way for adaptation to climate change is represented by a rational management of the biosphere and in particular of the agricultural sector: by the adoption of specific agricultural practices. Agriculture is potentially able to reduce its emission with minor costs with respect to other activities, to increase carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, agricultural activities play a fundamental role in soil carbon sequestration and reduction of emissions, mainly because of the high stock capacity of this element associated with long retention time in the soil. The cultivated land (arable and tree crops) occupy 28 % of the Italian territory, for a total of 10. 9 million ha which can stock massive reserves of carbon by putting in place agronomic measures and/or agro-ecological infrastructure useful to reduce the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere. The net balance of the two processes on an annual basis can result in positive net flows (emissions) or negative (sequestration). However, the aggregated balance sheet of carbon for agricultural soils is subject to significant uncertainties with estimates that can vary greatly depending on the method and data sources. The average European values, for example, range from losses of - 0. 17 ± 0. 33 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 (emissions), when calculated from data in the inventory {{of agricultural}} soils (available for 33 % of the European cultivated land) to values of accumulation of 0. 15 ± 0. 15, or loss of - 0. 08 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 when calculated with simulation models. It is estimated that in Italy over the past 70 years, the intensification of agricultural activities has caused a net loss of soil organic carbon by 39 % compared to the initial content. The extent of actual SOC sequestration achieved on Italian cultivated land will crucially depend on future policies which could contemplate the inclusion of agriculture in an emissions trading scheme, either as a covered sector, or as an offset provider. It is important to face some research questions mainly aimed at removing this barrier to inclusion of soil carbon in emissions trading. Complementary measures, such as research, development and technology transfer to improve the extension to improve adoption of existing techniques or direct financing to accelerate the adoption of conservation farming systems, should be carried out...|$|E

Oniward Svubure (2015). Agronomic and environmental studies of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{and analysis of}} its value chain in Zimbabwe. PhD thesis, Wageningen University, The Netherlands, with English summary, 220 pp. Irish potato is food {{for more than a}} billion people worldwide. In Zimbabwe, Irish potato is becoming an important food crop. The government declared it a national strategic food security crop on 18 May 2012. This major policy pronouncement, qualified Irish potato for government initiated farmer support initiatives such as mechanisation and irrigation capacity building. The growing importance of potato as a food crop is prefaced on rising food insecurity in the country coupled with the impact of the radical land reform of 2000 on agricultural production. The land reform completely restructured commercial agriculture when about 96 % of the original 12. 5 million ha of large-scale commercial farmland in 1980 was taken up for resettlement by 2010. Two resettlement models were used, the A 1 and A 2 resettlement models. The former resembles the communal area land allocation system while the later are self-contained small to medium scale farm units ranging about 35 to 300 ha. The newly resettled farmers have started growing potato adding to the already existing communal area and the few remaining large-scale commercial farmers. It is in this context that the potential of the new agrarian structure to sustainably increase Irish potato production was investigated. Increasing potato production on a sustainable basis will enable the crop to assert itself as a national strategic food security crop and help ease the food security challenges the country is grappling with. A grower survey was conducted on the cultural practices, input use, average yield, and infrastructure for potato production. The survey data was used to categorise the growers. Only growers with a minimum 5 years continuous potato growing experience were targeted making the data collected dependable. Grower resource footprints of land, water, biocides and nutrients were calculated based on the actual yield, Ya. Further, the Ya data collected were used to calculate the yield gap, YG, based on the yield of the best performing growers, Yh, simulated yield potential, Yp, and water-limited potential yield, Yw, of the respective agro-ecological areas. The LINTUL-POTATO model was used to estimate Yp, Yw and water need. This model simulates potential dry matter production based on radiation use efficiency of intercepted light by the potato crop. Another model, the Cool Farm Tool-Potato was used to further distinguish and appraise the production systems in terms of yields, inputs and efficient use of energy as reflected in their CO 2 balances. The model calculates the contributions of various production operations to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Consequently, grower practices which contribute the most to the GHG emission were identified and generic mitigation measures for each production system were suggested. Realising the growing importance of sustainability issues in agricultural production and the scarcity of evaluation protocols in cropping systems, the study developed a framework {{that can be used to}} evaluate cropping systems. The framework was constructed using the potato-based cropping systems in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. Finally, instead of just focusing on the production related aspects only, the study also took into cognisance the need to understand the performance of the entire Irish potato sector in Zimbabwe. A value-chain analysis was therefore conducted to evaluate the performance the Irish potato sector in the country. Irish potato production in Zimbabwe is still low. Experts estimate annual production at nearly 120, 000 t from around 6, 000 ha. The large-scale commercial and the A 2 resettlement are large-scale, high input and <b>mechanised</b> <b>systems</b> with an average potato area of 9 ha per planting. The communal area and A 1 resettlement are smallholder low input systems with average potato area per planting of 0. 8 ha and animal-drawn equipment is used. On resource use efficiencies, the actual tuber yield ranged from 8 – 35 t/ha across all systems representing a yield gap of over 77 %. Comparing with the simulated average potential yield, the mean actual yield observed ranged from 8 to 35 % of the simulated potential yield, translating to a yield gap of 65 to 92 %. Hence there is a large potential to increase potato production in these environments. The nutrient use efficiencies range were: 97 to 162 g potato g- 1 N, 93 – 105 g potato g- 1 P 2 O 5 and 97 – 123 g potato g- 1 K 2 O. This was anticipated because of the high synthetic fertiliser use and the low actual yields reported. The biocide use efficiencies ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 9 kg potato g- 1 active ingredient (a. i.) fungicide, and 8 to 15 kg potato g- 1 a. i. insecticide. Regarding water use, the average water use efficiency based on irrigation water and rainfall, ranged from 2 to 6 g potato l- 1, while the simulated potential water use efficiency from irrigation and precipitation ranged from 9 to 17 g potato l- 1. The large gap observed between actual and potential water use efficiency shows the scope to improve crop management practices to increase actual yield while lowering irrigation water. On the CO 2 balance of the systems, a high carbon footprint was reported with an average of 251 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato. The least average carbon footprint was 216 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato for the communal area, while the A 2 resettlement system had the highest of 286 kg CO 2 eq. /t potato. The high carbon footprint was anticipated as a reflection of the systems’ inefficiencies in terms of low yields and high input use. Focussing on the performance of the entire Irish potato sector, value chain analysis showed considerable levels of value-addition and gross profit of at least 13 % at each linkage. While the sector enjoys government policy support, major factors impacting on the value-chain performance relate to high potato production costs, low yields, and lack of farmer training. On the proposed framework on cropping sustainability, the indicator thresholds serve to monitor farmer progress as they improve their practices towards the desired direction of sustainability. This study demonstrated that there is tremendous potential to increase potato output and help ease the food insecurity challenges the country currently faces.    ...|$|E

5000|$|The term dark store first {{appeared}} in the UK in 2009 when Tesco opened their first such supermarkets in Croydon, Surrey, and Aylesford, Kent. At the time, Tesco were receiving around 475,000 orders per week which were being fulfilled from its existing retail supermarkets. Supermarkets began opening dark stores to assist with distribution in geographical areas where there was a high demand for online delivery. The dark store format was seen by Tesco as a more efficient way of dealing with the expansion in online sales. The retailer planned to open one dark store per year [...] "for the foreseeable future". By 2013, Tesco had opened six dotcom centres in and around London, and was responsible for 47.5% of online deliveries made in the UK. The latest of these was a store that opened in Erith in October 2013, and which the industry publication Retail Gazette described as a [...] "fourth generation dotcom store" [...] because of the greater emphasis on a <b>mechanised</b> <b>system</b> that brought items to pickers rather than requiring them to collect individual products manually, while chilled goods are conveyed directly from refrigerator to delivery van.

Possibilities to compare the mechanization’s impact on efficiency of firewood processing are limited, due to variations between working conditions in previous studies. Therefore, the objective was to compare time consumption for two small-scale firewood processing systems with different levels of mechanisation under identical conditions. The systems were tested on two classes of wood: one with a homogeneous and medium-sized diameter of logs and one with a mixture of small and large-diameter-logs. Differences in time consumption were analysed for correlations with physical workloads, deviations to routine operations, operator influences and operator perceptions. Twelve operators (60 - 79 years old) were studied and they showed large variation in time consumption. However, the within-operator time consumption patterns were consistent. In other words, operators all responded similarly to the different combinations of systems and wood classes, but at different absolute levels. The time required to process a unit volume of wood was 25 - 33 % lower when the more highly <b>mechanised</b> <b>system</b> was used, and the time required was 13 - 22 % lower for the homogeneous wood class. Physical work load, deviations and perceptions of the work varied between operators, but were weakly correlated with time consumption.
