25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). <b>Manufacturable</b> in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of the {{microprocessor}} and software based design tools, analog ICs were designed using hand calculations and process kit parts. These ICs were low complexity circuits, for example, op-amps, usually involving no more than ten transistors and few connections. An iterative trial-and-error process and [...] "overengineering" [...] of device size was often necessary to achieve a <b>manufacturable</b> IC. Reuse of proven designs allowed progressively more complicated ICs to be built upon prior knowledge. When inexpensive computer processing became available in the 1970s, computer programs were written to simulate circuit designs with greater accuracy than practical by hand calculation. The first circuit simulator for analog ICs was called SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis). Computerized circuit simulation tools enable greater IC design complexity than hand calculations can achieve, making the design of analog ASICs practical. The computerized circuit simulators also enable mistakes to be found early in the design cycle before a physical device is fabricated. Additionally, a computerized circuit simulator can implement more sophisticated device models and circuit analysis too tedious for hand calculations, permitting Monte Carlo analysis and process sensitivity analysis to be practical. The effects of parameters such as temperature variation, doping concentration variation and statistical process variations can be simulated easily to determine if an IC design is <b>manufacturable.</b> Overall, computerized circuit simulation enables a higher degree of confidence that the circuit will work as expected upon manufacture.|$|E

50|$|Born in Lucca, Tuscany, Matteucci studied {{hydraulic}} {{and mechanical}} engineering, first in Paris, then in Florence. In 1851 he met Father Barsanti and appreciated his ideas {{for a new}} type of engine. They worked together to turn the primary concept into a <b>manufacturable</b> item, eventually developing a model suitable for mass production. Its construction was entrusted to Bauer & Co. of Milan, a company also known as Helvetica, which delivered the motor at the beginning of 1863.|$|E
50|$|The {{most easily}} {{machined}} types of metals include aluminum, brass, and softer metals. As materials get harder, denser and stronger, such as steel, stainless steel, titanium, and exotic alloys, they become {{much harder to}} machine and take much longer, thus being less <b>manufacturable.</b> Most types of plastic are easy to machine, although additions of fiberglass or carbon fiber can reduce the machinability. Plastics that are particularly soft and gummy may have machinability problems of their own.|$|E
5000|$|This type of air pump, {{notable for}} low noise and high efficiency, was {{patented}} on 3 October 1905 by Léon Creux of France (US Patent 801,182). [...] Due {{to the very}} imprecise production methods of the period, however, it was not <b>manufacturable</b> for a long time, since the displacer (described below) inside the compressor comes within tenths of a millimetre of the housing wall without making contact. Only with the more advanced engineering methods of the 1980s, did it become possible to produce the G-Lader.|$|E
50|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, {{an important step}} is design rule check. This step ensures that the completed design is <b>manufacturable.</b> The check involves rules that specify widths and spacings and other geometry patterns. A modern design can have billions of polygons that represent wires and transistors. Efficient checking relies heavily on geometry query. For example, a rule may specify that any polygon {{must be at least}} n nanometers from any other polygon. This is converted into a geometry query by enlarging a polygon by n at all sides and query to find all intersecting polygons.|$|E
50|$|The BiCMOS logic family {{employed}} the npn devices in the pull-up {{path of the}} BiCMOS gate, to form a low power CMOS logic family with high capacitive drive capability. Intel's BiCMOS technology was enabled by an innovative triple diffused npn transistor. This led to a highly <b>manufacturable</b> low cost process due to minimum number of additional process steps. In contrast, other companies employed BiCMOS to implement Emitter-coupled logic for microprocessors, which consumed much more power. The BiCMOS circuits were developed for the Pentium processor family and its follow-on generations Pentium Pro, Pentium II processor family.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of logic synthesis for HDLs pushed HDLs from the background into the foreground of digital design. Synthesis tools compiled HDL source files (written in a constrained format called RTL) into a <b>manufacturable</b> netlist description {{in terms of}} gates and transistors. Writing synthesizable RTL files required practice and discipline {{on the part of}} the designer; compared to a traditional schematic layout, synthesized RTL netlists were almost always larger in area and slower in performance. A circuit design from a skilled engineer, using labor-intensive schematic-capture/hand-layout, would almost always outperform its logically-synthesized equivalent, but the productivity advantage held by synthesis soon displaced digital schematic capture to exactly those areas that were problematic for RTL synthesis: extremely high-speed, low-power, or asynchronous circuitry.|$|E

At Cambridge he has transformed the field of organic semiconductor transistors from curiosity to fully <b>manufacturable</b> technology through both fundamental science and engineering. His insights into the polaronic nature of electron states in these materials and the control of interfacial structure made possible large increases in field-effect carrier mobility. His work on novel processing methods, including ink-jet printing, has made possible new manufacturing methods. A recent highlight is his realisation of a light-emitting field-effect transistor.|$|E

50|$|After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms {{came into}} play. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who {{improved}} the economic {{conditions of the}} masses. However, the home spun textile industry suffered during British rule, due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional hand woven industry, especially spinning and weaving. Only weavers who produced the very finest cloth not <b>manufacturable</b> by machines survived the changing economy. Even here, {{the change in the}} dressing habits of the people, who adapted to English clothes, had an adverse impact. Only the agricultural and rural masses with their need for coarse cloth sustained the low quality home industry. Also, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly found middle class. This class consisted of four occupational groups; the trading and merchant class consisting of agents, brokers, shopkeepers; the landlords created under the Zamindar system and Janmi system of land tenure; the money lenders; and the white collared lawyers, teachers, civil servants, doctors, journalists and bankers. However, due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, this middle class consisted of a more heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E
50|$|It {{might be}} {{expected}} that lenses appropriate {{for a range of}} sensor sizes could be produced by simply scaling the same designs in proportion to the crop factor. Such an exercise would in theory produce a lens with the same F-number and angle of view, with a size proportional to the sensor crop factor. In practice, simple scaling of lens designs is not always achievable, due to factors such as the non-scalability of manufacturing tolerance, structural integrity of glass lenses of different sizes and available manufacturing techniques and costs. Moreover, to maintain the same absolute amount of information in an image (which can be measured as the space bandwidth product) the lens for a smaller sensor requires a greater resolving power. The development of the 'Tessar' lens is discussed by Nasse, and shows its transformation from an f/6.3 lens for plate cameras using the original three-group configuration through to an f/2.8 5.2 mm four-element optic with eight extremely aspheric surfaces, economically <b>manufacturable</b> because of its small size. Its performance is 'better than the best 35 mm lenses - but only for a very small image'.|$|E
