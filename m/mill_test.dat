Cozen’s <b>test,</b> <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> and Maudsley test are most widely used. Till date no studies have been reported on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography serves as a gold standard tool in the diagnosis of LE. Thirty subjects participated in the study. Baseline measurements of pain severity, elbow joint mobility, hand grip strength and three provocative tests were recorded by the principal investigator. A second investigator accompanied the subjects for musculoskeletal ultrasonography who was blinded of the test results. The thickness of common extensor tendon, echo texture and lateral epicondyle bony contour was measured. The test results of the three provocative tests with ultrasonographic findings were analyzed. The sensitivity for Cozen’s test, Maudsley <b>test</b> and <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> was found to be 84 %, 88 % and 53 % respectively.

One type of natural fibre that is of great relevance to Malaysia is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB). To produce EFB-filled unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites, PVC resin and the various additives were first dry-blended using a laboratory blender before being milled into sheets on a two-roll <b>mill.</b> <b>Test</b> specimens were then hot pressed, alter which the mechanical and thermal properties were determined. Four untreated EFB fibre contents were employed, 10, 20, 30 and 40 phr. The increase in EPB fibre content resulted in an improvement in flexural modulus at the expense of impact strength and flexural strength. The incorporation of EFB slightly enhanced the glass transition temperature but it decreased the thermal stability of the composites, evidenced by a decrease in decomposition temperature and a change in the degradation process from two to three stages...|$|E

40|$|Experimental bending tests {{carried out}} to assess the {{reliability}} of the plastic moment of resistance formula revealed experimental bending strengths that typically exceeded their theoretical plastic moment capacities by an average of 18 %. These findings are based on tests carried out on lightweight sections, whose stress strain characteristics showed strain hardening immediately after yielding, with no significant zone of plasticity. It is not understood whether the results are transferable to heavier sections and this work attempts to answer the scale effects question. A method for predicting the full (elastic and post-plastic) moment-rotation curves for laterally restrained steel beams, based on stress-strain data from mill tests is explained.

40|$|Improved log {{breakdown}} into lumber {{has been}} an active research topic since the 1960 's. Demonstrated economic gains have driven {{the search for a}} cost-effective method to scan logs internally, from which it is assumed one can chose a better breakdown strategy. X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been widely accepted as the most promising internal imaging technique. Six design and operational constraints needed to be satisfied, however, for industrial CT of logs to become a viable reality. These are aperture size and reconstruction circle, scanning speed, scanner duty cycle, harsh industrial environments, radiation safety, and effective application sofiware. Current airport security scanners have achieved those goals and have bridged the gap between medical CT applications and industrial CT. The log scanning application has numerous similarities with the explosive detection application, which points to a relatively straightforward transition. A recent <b>mill</b> <b>test</b> of CT log scanning validates the value gains that can be realized. In some cases, those gains may become more pronounced in later processing stages.

The size of coal lumps can be reduced in ball mill tests by two mechanisms (a) volume breakage and/or (b) surface breakage. The degradation characteristics of both types of coal were the same but the rate of degradation was higher in South Blackwater coal than Ensham coal. There was a distinct difference for degradation rate between the three different sizes of South Blackwater coal in the partially-cushioned coal but the rate of degradation increased with tumbling time.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} of ball mill cicuits {{has been found}} to be very valuable for optimisation where existing plant data can be used to calibrate the mathematical models used. However, as by definition no existing plant is available for calibration in greenfield scenarios, the use of simulation in ball mill circuit design has been limited. Running a pilot ball mill circuit can overcome this problem but this requires a reasonably large sample and therefore can be costly. In addition a valid scale-up procedure is required. To overcome these limitations in using modelling and simulation for designing ball mill circuits, a programme of research was initiated at the JKMRC in which it was proposed to use laboratory ball <b>mill</b> <b>test</b> results to calibrate a suitable ball mill mathematical model for use in predicting full scale plant performance. To validate the technique, laboratory tests were conducted on a range of ore samples from existing plants, whose ball mill circuits were surveyed.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} knowledge about how the material specification of case hardening steel should be modified in order to create a robust and predictable production process with focus on machinability. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying microstructure variations produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. A standardized <b>milling</b> <b>test</b> was used to assess machinability (with respect to tool wear) as this method has the advantage of only needing small diametrical samples and low material volumes. From the results of the test, it can be concluded that machinability is more influenced by pearlite nodular size than by pearlite morphology. Furthermore, it can be stated that hardness is not a suitable criterion for determining machinability of case hardening steel. In the manufacturing process of transmission parts (such as gear milling/hobbing) high speed steel tools are commonly used.

40|$|The {{influence}} of strain hardening on elastic-plastic frame instability {{has become more}} critical since the introduction of modern design codes (e. g.

At the same time, it has become apparent that portal frames are much more sensitive to second-order effects than was previously believed. Both the simplicity and economy of plastic design are endangered and there is renewed interest in defining the extent to which advantage can be taken of strain hardening with modem steel qualities and section shapes. This paper provides an up to date assessment of the strain hardening factor that may be incorporated into computer programs for second-order elastic-plastic analysis. A survey of tensile tests (mill tests) is presented which shows that the strain hardening behaviour is independent of material thickness and steel grade. This allows a generalisation of the stress-strain relationship for hot rolled steel to be defined. A modelling technique is presented that allows the non-linear moment-deformation behaviour of beams to be accurately predicted using <b>mill</b> <b>test</b> data. Finally, results from the survey of mill tests are combined with the moment-deformation model to estimate values of the strain hardening factor to be used during elastic-plastic design...|$|E
