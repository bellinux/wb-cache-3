The {{proceedings}} of the trial were relayed in real-time by the court's official <b>microblog</b> account, though journalists covering the trial needed {{to belong to a}} pre-approved list. Bo faced three charges: bribery, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The prosectors alleged that Bo received the equivalent of some 21.79 million yuan (US$3.56 million) in bribes from businessmen Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin. At the trial Xu Ming testified that he gave Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills. Bo Xilai cross-examined Xu and denied knowledge of many of the payments.|$|E

25|$|Microblogging: Microblogging is the {{practice}} of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, {{in part because the}} short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) <b>microblog</b> about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>microblogging</b> {{is widely}} studied by the {{researchers}} {{in the domain of}} the online social network (OSN). How to evaluate the popularities of <b>microblogging</b> users is an important research field, which can be applied to commercial advertising, user behavior analysis and information dissemination, and so forth. Previous studies on the evaluation methods cannot effectively solve and accurately evaluate the popularities of the microbloggers.

Although many researchers have attempted to explain why and how people use this new medium, previous studies have produced relatively inconclusive results. For instance, {{in most of these}} studies, <b>microblogging</b> has been considered a social networking activity; however, quantitative analyses of <b>microblogging</b> usage have shown that people use <b>microblogging</b> as an information-broadcasting platform.

We empirically tested our research model using a sample of 230 microbloggers, and the results showed that content and technology gratifications are the two key factors that drive user satisfaction with <b>microblogging.</b> That is, it is the value of information dissemination rather than social networking that makes people feel satisfied with the use of <b>microblogging.</b> We believe that this study will generate interest among researchers in social media.

40|$|The {{availability}} of <b>microblogging,</b> like Twitter and Sina Weibo, {{makes it a}} popular platform for spammers to unfairly overpower normal users with unwanted content via social networks, known as social spamming. The rise of social spamming can significantly hinder the use of <b>microblogging</b> systems for effective information dissemination and sharing. Distinct features of <b>microblogging</b> systems present new challenges for social spammer detection. First, unlike traditional social networks, <b>microblogging</b> allows to establish some connections between two parties without mutual consent, which {{makes it easier for}} spammers to imitate normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of “human ” friends. Second, <b>microblogging</b> messages are short, noisy, and unstructured. Traditional social spammer detection methods are not directly adaptable to <b>microblogging.</b> In this paper, we investigate how to collectively use network and content information to perform effective social spammer detection in <b>microblogging.</b> In particular, we present an optimization formulation that models the social network and content information in a unified framework. Experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively utilize both kinds of information for social spammer detection. ...|$|R

Currently, spammer detection in <b>microblogging</b> focuses on using social networking information, but little on content analysis due to the distinct nature of <b>microblogging</b> messages. First, label information is hard to obtain. Second, the texts in <b>microblogging</b> are short and noisy.
