5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI {{have been found to}} assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E

25|$|Curzon (12 May 1917) and Hankey (20 May) {{continued}} to urge that Britain seize {{land in the}} Middle East. Allenby, Murray's replacement, {{had been told by}} Lloyd George that his objective was “Jerusalem before Christmas” and that he had only to ask for reinforcements, but Robertson warned him that he <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the needs of other fronts for men and shipping. Allenby’s exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.|$|E
25|$|Each {{perspective}} <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> {{account the}} requirements of the other perspectives and the restraint those perspectives impose. The constraints of each perspective are additive. For example, the constraints of higher rows affect the rows below. The constraints of lower rows can, but do not necessarily affect the higher rows. Understanding the requirements and constraints necessitates communication of knowledge and understanding from perspective to perspective. The Framework points the vertical direction for that communication between perspectives.|$|E

25|$|Free divers {{may also}} use weights to {{counteract}} buoyancy of a wetsuit. However, {{they are more}} likely to weight for neutral buoyancy at a specific depth, and their weighting <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account not only the compression of the suit with depth, but also the compression of the air in their lungs, and the consequent loss of buoyancy. As they have no decompression obligation, they do not have to be neutrally buoyant near the surface at the end of a dive.|$|E
25|$|In astrophysical {{systems with}} strong {{gravitational}} fields, {{such as those}} near the event horizon of a black hole, -body simulations <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account general relativity; such simulations are the domain of numerical relativity. Numerically simulating the Einstein field equations is extremely challenging and a parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), such as the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations, is used if possible. The two-body problem in general relativity is analytically solvable only for the Kepler problem, in which one mass {{is assumed to be}} much larger than the other.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{proposed}} European Constitution {{and now the}} Treaty of Lisbon included a provision that the choice of President <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the result of Parliamentary elections and the candidate supported by the victorious Europarty in particular. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), who won the elections, pressured for a candidate from its own ranks. In the end, José Manuel Barroso, the EPP candidate, was chosen by the European Council.|$|E

It would have been difficult in these circumstances for him to have clearly stated that this had originally been a slaving expedition.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account every single one of these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of the {{economics}} of nuclear power <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies {{where many of the}} risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of {{the economics}} of new nuclear power plants.|$|E
