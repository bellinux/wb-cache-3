5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E
