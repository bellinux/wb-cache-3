25|$|The famous Sioux leader Sitting Bull is {{connected}} to Willow Bunch through his relationship with Jean-Louis Légaré. Sitting Bull led the Sioux and the Cheyenne in the Battle of Little Bighorn against General Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment. After the battle, the Sioux retreated to Saskatchewan, settling in the Wood Mountain area. The first group of Sioux was sent as a scouting party. They crossed the border along Frenchman river below the present villages of Val Marie and Mankota. They arrived at Jean-Louis Légaré’s trading-post on November 17, 1876. “I was in my store with two of <b>my</b> <b>men,</b> when a dozen savages on horseback appeared.” They told Légaré they needed supplies and came to “sleep in peace.” Légaré gave them $30 in goods and they went away. The next day, they came back with seventy lodges and camped.|$|E

500|$|The brigades of Wilcox and Lang hit {{the front}} and right flank of Humphreys's line, dooming any chance for his {{division}} to maintain its position on the Emmitsburg Road and completing {{the collapse of the}} III Corps. Humphrey displayed considerable bravery during the attack, leading his men from horseback and forcing them to maintain good order during their withdrawal. He wrote to his wife, [...] "Twenty times did I [...] <b>my</b> <b>men</b> to a halt and face about ... forcing the men to it." ...|$|E
500|$|The brigade was {{advancing}} in quarter column {{as directed}} by Methuen's orders. [...] The soldiers advanced packed as closely together as possible, with each ordered to grasp his neighbour {{to prevent the}} men losing {{contact with each other}} in the darkness. As first light approached, the storm abated and the Brigade was on course, but the delays put them [...] from the line of hills. Wauchope's guide, Major Benson of the Royal Artillery, suggested to Wauchope that it was no longer safe to continue in closed formation and that the Brigade should deploy. Wauchope replied [...] "... I'm afraid <b>my</b> <b>men</b> will lose direction. I think we will go a little further." [...] Still in quarter column, the Highlanders advanced further towards the unknown enemy lines, when an advancing British soldier tripped an alarm on the fence in front of the Boer trench.|$|E

The king... was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.|$|E

500|$|In Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell {{recommended}} a distinctive and practical uniform that was [...] "very like the uniform worn by <b>my</b> <b>men</b> when I commanded the South African Constabulary". This in turn, {{seems to have}} been derived from the dress adopted by Baden-Powell in the Second Matabele War of 1896, influenced by his friend and colleague, Frederick Russell Burnham. The original Boy Scout uniform consisted of a khaki shirt and shorts, a neckerchief or [...] "scarf", campaign hat and a Scout staff. At the formation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, Baden-Powell wanted to make the younger boys totally distinct from the older Boy Scouts; the result was a green woollen jersey, shorts, neckerchief and a green cricket cap with gold piping. In 1946, the new Senior Scout section were allowed to wear a maroon beret instead of the hat; a green beret became an option for the Boy Scout section in 1954.|$|E
500|$|However, McClellan soon {{received}} a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home." [...] He telegraphed President Lincoln: [...] "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if <b>my</b> <b>men</b> are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies." ...|$|E

The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide <b>my</b> <b>men</b> over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

500|$|While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he {{was only}} repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the {{concession}} itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied [...] "Take <b>my</b> <b>men</b> to England for me; and when you return, then I will talk about that." [...] Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from Natal, was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want <b>my</b> <b>men</b> to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
2500|$|Where as {{his rule}} of Wazirabad is {{described}} as just and rigorous, his governorship of Peshawar is depicted {{as a rule of}} [...] "gallows and gibbets". Avitabile boasted: [...] "When I marched into Peshawar, I sent on in advance a number of wooden posts which <b>my</b> <b>men</b> erected around the walls of the city. The men scoffed at them and laughed at the madness of the feringhee , and harder still when <b>my</b> <b>men</b> came in and laid coils of rope {{at the foot of the}} posts...However, when my preparations were completed and they found one fine morning danging from these posts, fifty of the worse characters in Peshawar, they thought different. And I repeated the exhibition every day till I had made a scarcity of brigands and murderers. Then I had to deal with the liars and tale bearers. My method with them was to cut out their tongues. When a surgeon appeared and professed to be able to restore their speech, I sent for him and cut out his tongue also. After that there was peace".|$|E

2500|$|Laudonnière {{then pushed}} {{on through the}} woods, where his party was {{increased}} the following day by that of the artist, Jacques Le Moyne. Wandering along one of the forest paths with which he was familiar, Le Moyne had come upon four other fugitives like himself. After consultation together the party broke up, Le Moyne going {{in the direction of}} the sea to find Ribault's boats, and the others making for an Indian settlement. Le Moyne finally, while still in the forest, came upon the party of Laudonnière. Laudonnière had taken the direction of the sea in the evident hope of finding the vessels Ribault had sent inside the bar. After a while the marshes were reached, [...] "Where," [...] he wrote, [...] "being able to go no farther by reason of my sicknesse which I had, I sent two of <b>my</b> <b>men</b> which were with me, which could swim well, unto the ships to advertise them of that which had happened, and to send them word to come and helpe me.
