Erythrocyte deformability was measured with a filtration method and expressed as red cell filtration rate (RFR). RFR was reduced after CPB and the reduction was time dependent. Trilinolein at a concentration of 10 (- 7) M significantly reversed the CPB-induced reduction of RFR when it was <b>mixed</b> with <b>blood</b> samples collected 30, 60 and 90 min {{from the start of}} CPB.

Native and European <b>mixed</b> <b>blood</b> populations are far less than in other Latin American countries.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} the future Gondor territory were the Drúedain, {{who lived in the}} vales of the White Mountains and lands adjacent. Later they were harried and mostly ousted by new people coming from the east; these were allied to Sauron and unrelated to the Edain. The coastlands remained unsettled until the beginning of colonisation by the Númenóreans, who either <b>mixed</b> <b>blood</b> with the natives or dispersed them if hostile. The original language of the settlers, Adûnaic, was heavily influenced by local speech and ultimately resulted in Westron, becoming used, at least for intercourse, by the majority of peoples in the west of Middle-earth.|$|E

25|$|This {{marriage}} proved disastrous to Gondor: {{when it was}} {{affirmed that}} {{the heir to the}} throne would be Valacar's son Eldacar, who was of <b>mixed</b> <b>blood,</b> southern provinces of the realm began to rebel. After Valacar died, several members of the House of Anárion claimed the crown and a full-scale civil war, called the Kin-strife, broke out in 1432. The rebel with the largest following was Castamir, who besieged and captured Osgiliath. Eldacar managed to escape to his homeland in Rhovanion, but his elder son was captured and executed. Castamir proved a very poor ruler and earned the hatred of the inner provinces; consequently, Eldacar acquired a great following when he returned after several years with the Northmen allies, slew Castamir and defeated his army. Castamir's sons, however, retreated to Umbar and declared independence.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{first went}} to Washington, D.C. in 1816 {{as part of a}} Cherokee {{delegation}} to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, {{he was elected to the}} National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of <b>mixed</b> <b>blood.</b> Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, the first time a tribe had ever shown the audacity to do such a thing. Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.|$|E
