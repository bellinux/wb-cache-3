5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over {{a few seconds of}} typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, in as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts to as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at {{the two sides of the}} road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E

There are estimates that some Indians might have eaten as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> ton of acorns in one year. A major advantage of acorns is that they grew wild, could be easily gathered in large quantities, and could be easily stored over a winter for a reliable winter food source. Almost none of these Indian food supplies were in a typical European's diet.|$|E
25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers {{will appear on the}} screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count.

25|$|The Strait of Dover {{is thought}} to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the {{breaching}} of the Weald-Artois Anticline, which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley {{down the length of the}} English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.|$|E

25|$|The bay was navigable as {{far south}} as San Jose until the 1850s, when {{hydraulic}} mining released massive amounts of sediment from the rivers that settled in those parts of the bay that had little or no current. Later, wetlands and inlets were deliberately filled in, reducing the Bay's size since the mid-19th century by as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> third. Recently, large areas of wetlands have been restored, further confusing the issue of the Bay's size. Despite its value as a waterway and harbor, many thousands of acres of marshy wetlands {{at the edges of the}} bay were, for many years, considered wasted space. As a result, soil excavated for building projects or dredged from channels was often dumped onto the wetlands and other parts of the bay as landfill.|$|E
25|$|Careful selection: He relied more {{on small}} numbers of well-trained {{soldiers}} than he did large masses of the poorly trained variety. In this way, one superior soldier counted for as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> hundred inferior soldiers. One example used to illustrate this was when the armies of Han Ching and Wu Xu were transferred into Yue's camp. Most of them had never seen battle and were generally too old or unhealthy for sustaining prolonged troop movement and engagement of the enemy. Once Yue had filtered out the weak soldiers and sent them home, he was only left with a meager thousand able-bodied soldiers. However, after some months of intense training, {{they were ready to}} perform almost as well as the soldiers who had served under Yue for years.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant negative impact of water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century area under cultivation in Sonora dropped by more than 24%.|$|E

25|$|Viet Minh units {{occasionally}} made {{forays into}} Cambodian bases during their {{war against the}} French, and, {{in conjunction with the}} leftist government that ruled Thailand until 1947, the Viet Minh encouraged the formation of armed, left-wing Khmer Issarak bands. On April 17, 1950 (twenty-five years to the day before the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh), the first nationwide congress of the Khmer Issarak groups convened, and the United Issarak Front was established. Its leader was Son Ngoc Minh (possibly a brother of the nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh), and a third of its leadership consisted of members of the ICP. According to the historian David P. Chandler, the leftist Issarak groups, aided by the Viet Minh, occupied a sixth of Cambodia's territory by 1952; and, {{on the eve of the}} Geneva Conference, they controlled as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> half of the country.|$|E
25|$|Hunting {{often had}} {{elaborate}} preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men {{before and after}} the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting. Also the slaughter of animals must be performed following certain religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) from prescribing how to cut the animals, what prayers to recite, and proper disposal of bones. A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp. Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.|$|E

The products were introduced {{in a series of}} three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
