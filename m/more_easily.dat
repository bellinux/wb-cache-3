5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} folic acid. Another proposed {{explanation is that}} it is used to supply dietary fiber, helping the cat defecate <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit.|$|E
5|$|ClearText, {{which enables}} {{visually}} impaired users to browse the web <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> by making text {{easier for them}} to read, was developed in conjunction with the college. In 2009 RNC lecturer Tony Sales developed Vinux, an accessible version of the Linux operating system for the visually impaired.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in the Roman Empire {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> expressed and understood.|$|E
5000|$|Touring or commuting: This style {{concentrates}} on distance riding. With a 29 or 36 in wheel cruising speeds of 10 to 15 mi/h km/h or <b>more</b> can <b>easily</b> be reached.|$|R
50|$|Bindings {{connections}} are generally faster, but client connections {{allow for a}} <b>more</b> robust, <b>easily</b> changeable application design. For instance, with a client connection, the physical location of the queue manager is irrelevant, {{as long as it}} is reachable over the network.|$|R

5|$|However, {{in these}} {{reactions}} the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water much <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> than thorium.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for the missing piers.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century closer {{links with}} Taunton meant {{that many of}} the {{residents}} of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway, which opened in sections in the 1960s and 1970s, enabled car journeys to be made <b>more</b> <b>easily.</b>|$|E
50|$|The final {{was held}} on 19 August. Jarvis won <b>easily,</b> <b>more</b> than ten minutes ahead of Halmay.|$|R
30|$|Better, <b>more</b> effective, <b>easily</b> {{deployable}} vaccines—beyond {{the traditional}} vaccines {{used in the}} EPI (Expanded Programme on Immunization) {{there is also a}} need to better utilize existing vaccines (e.g. against typhoid, pneumonia) and develop more effective vaccines in the future (e.g. against TB, malaria, HIV/AIDS).|$|R

5|$|In theory, radon is more {{reactive}} than xenon, {{and therefore}} should form chemical bonds <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> than xenon does. However, {{due to the}} high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice.|$|E
5|$|Recent use of {{high-tensile steel}} allows {{building}} a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength. However, {{because it is}} thinner than regular steel, HT steel can corrode <b>more</b> <b>easily,</b> plus it can develop metal fatigue in choppy seas.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
30|$|We can use two or <b>more</b> cameras <b>easily</b> in our method, if the {{increase}} of computational load is acceptable. Introduction {{of different types of}} sensor information, such as depth images and haptic images, is also straightforward. Information from such additional sensors can contribute to more reliable playback.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} stages or testlets can vary. If the testlets are {{relatively}} small, such as five items, ten or <b>more</b> could <b>easily</b> {{be used in a}} test. Some multistage tests are designed with the minimum of two stages (one stage would be a conventional fixed-form test).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{say that}} AMT could serve Mascouche <b>more</b> cheaply, <b>easily,</b> and quickly {{by using the}} CP line that leaves the Saint-Jérôme line at St. Martin Junction in Laval, also serving {{the eastern part of}} that city. AMT plans to reroute the Saint-Jérôme Line to Central Station by 2020.|$|R
5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, {{but also that}} of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E

5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. Even so, in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse {{on the front of}} the vehicle. This enables drivers of other vehicles to <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> identify an approaching ambulance in their rear view mirrors. Ambulances may display the name of their owner or operator, and an emergency telephone number for the ambulance service.|$|E
