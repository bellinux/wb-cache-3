40|$|Agricultural land is the <b>main</b> land <b>use</b> <b>category</b> in the Republic of Moldova. Agricultural {{land was}} 74, 5 % {{of the surface}} of the {{republic}} on January 1 st 2005. The dominance of agricultural landscape has been a reality on this territory {{since the beginning of the}} nineteenth century. During the latest 15 years, agricultural land has been dwindling (by 44. 4 ha per year). During the latest 5 years this rhythm has become more stable (about 2. 543 - 2. 520 ha). From the spatial point of view, the structure of land is relatively homogenous. Agricultural land represents the <b>main</b> land <b>use</b> <b>category</b> in most of the villages. At the beginning of 2005, agricultural land varied between 47. 9 % (Străşeni Department) and 87. 4 % (Drochia Department). Territorial differentiations in land use are caused by the variety of natural conditions (particularly, the morphological conditions and, partially, the soil and climatic conditions) as well as the population factor...|$|R

Jansen) growing regions of southern Ethiopia. Plant parts used as a medicine for different aliments were documented. Eighty-three percent of key informants replied that seeds were mostly used as traditional medicine followed by leaves (75 %) and rhizomes (72 %). The remedies were prepared from freshly collected plant materials and were mostly taken orally. The values of preference ranking on the <b>main</b> <b>use</b> <b>categories</b> of korarima indicated that the cash value obtained from sale of korarima was the 1 st <b>use</b> <b>category</b> {{for the majority of}} interviewed key informants. Essential oils of korarima were obtained by hydrodistillation. The oil refractive indices were recorded for leaf (1. 494) and rhizome (1. 445). When analyzed by GC and GC/MS, 38 (leaf) and 52 (rhizome) compounds were identified from the essential oils. The major component of the oil of the leaf was β-caryophyllene (60. 7 %).

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} within ethnobiology in the knowledge and practices of migrating people. Within this, scholars have given relatively less attention to displaced people and refugees: to the loss, maintenance, and adaptation of refugees' ethnobiological knowledge, and to its significance for refugees' wellbeing. This study focuses on cosmetics and remedies used to heal skin afflictions that are traditionally used by Sahrawi refugees displaced in South Western Algerian refugee camps. Methods: The research methods included a structured survey carried out with 37 refugee households, semi-structured interviews with 77 refugees, 24 retrospective interviews with refugees and other knowledgeable informants, and a voucher specimen collection of the plants and products cited. Results: We recorded the use of 55 plant species, nine animal species, and six mineral products used within the three <b>main</b> <b>use</b> <b>categories</b> discussed in this paper: 1) Remedies for health issues that are typical of the desert environment where the Sahrawi once lived as nomads and now live as refugees (e. g. eye afflictions); 2) Remedies for wounds that {{are influenced by the}} Sahrawi's recent history of guerrilla warfare; and 3) Cosmetics and products used for body care, decoration and perfuming (e. g. hair care, teeth cleansing, henna use) and for aromatizing the air inside of tents and which are widely used in everyday life and social practices. Conclusions: We discuss the changes that have occurred in the patterns of use and procurement of these products with exile and sedentarization in refugee camps, and conclude that refugees are not simply passive recipients of national and international aid, but rather struggle to maintain and recover their traditional ethnobiological practices in exile. Finally, we suggest further research into the ethnobiological practices and knowledge of displaced populations...|$|R

However, gardens of indigenous cultures are often considered to be spontaneous and disorganized. A reconnaissance survey of homegardens of the Batswana people in the North-West Province of South Africa examined the different <b>use</b> <b>categories</b> of garden plants, the indigenous and alien composition of garden floras, and determining whether a specific homegarden layout exist with tshingwana (micro-gardens) containing useful species. A floristic survey was conducted of 163 randomly selected tshimo’s from three Batswana communities (deep rural, rural and peri-urban). A total of 525 useful plant species belonging to 105 plant families were recorded. These could be divided into four <b>main</b> plant <b>use</b> <b>categories,</b> namely 98 food, 91 medicinal, 281 ornamental and 49 structurally functional species (e. g. hedges), while six species had other uses. Deep rural and rural homegardens are characterized by a higher percentage of naturally occurring, indigenous useful plant species when compared to the predominantly alien flora of peri-urban areas. Deep rural and rural homegardens had a specific garden layout that was characterised by six micro-gardens, namely food gardens, medicinal gardens, ornamental gardens, structural species, open areas and natural areas. In contrast, peri-urban Batswana gardens had a garden layout similar to European gardens...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>main</b> <b>uses</b> of <b>categories</b> are {{classification}} {{and feature}} inference, and category labels {{have been widely}} shown to play a dominant role in feature inference. However, {{the nature of this}} influence is unclear, and we evaluate two contrasting hypotheses formalized as mathematical models: the label special-mechanism hypothesis and the label super-salience hypothesis. The special-mechanism hypothesis is that category labels, unlike other features, trigger inference decision making in reference to the category prototypes. This results in a tendency for prototype-compatible inferences because the labels trigger a special mechanism rather than because of any influences they have on similarity evaluation. The super-salience hypothesis assumes that the large label influence is due to their high salience and corresponding impact on similarity without any need for a special mechanism. Application of the two models to a feature inference task based on a family resemblance category structure yields strong support for the label super-salience hypothesis and in particular does not support the need for a special mechanism based on prototypes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} software containers (Docker containers in particular) as {{a variant}} of server virtualization. Instead of virtualizing hardware, software containers rest {{on top of a}} single operating system instance and are much more efficient than hypervisors in system resource terms. Docker containers make it easy to package and ship applications, and guarantee that applications will always run the same, regardless of the environment they are running in. There is a whole range of use cases of containers, this work examines their usage in the field of software testing. The thesis proposes three <b>main</b> <b>use</b> case <b>categories</b> for running software systems in Docker containers. It introduces aspects for applications running in containers, which should give a better overview about an application setting within containers infrastructure. Subsequently, possible issues with testing software systems running inside Docker containers are discussed and the testing methods which address the presented issues are proposed. One proposed testing method was also used in the implementation of the framework for testing software running in Docker containers which was developed within this work...|$|R

To achieve this goal, the communication system will need to enable a diverse set of use cases, each with {{a specific set of}} requirements. We discuss the <b>main</b> <b>use</b> case <b>categories,</b> analyze their requirements, and compare them against the capabilities of currently available communication technologies. Based on the analysis, we identify a gap and point out towards possible system design for 5 G V 2 X that could close the gap. Furthermore, we discuss an architecture of the 5 G V 2 X radio access network that incorporates diverse communication technologies, including current and cellular systems in centimeter wave and millimeter wave, IEEE 802. 11 p and vehicular visible light communications. Finally, we discuss the role of future 5 G V 2 X systems in enabling more efficient vehicular transportation: from improved traffic flow through reduced inter-vehicle spacing on highways and coordinated intersections in cities (the cheapest way to increasing the road capacity), to automated smart parking (no more visits to the parking!), ultimately enabling seamless end-to-end personal mobility.

40|$|Integrating Point and Nonpoint (BASINS), {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the impact of land use (as characterized by different land use/land cover (LU/LC) datasets) on hydrology and sediment components of the Luxapallila Creek watershed. The 1, 770 km 2 watershed is located in Alabama and Mississippi. Simulation of the watershed processes were tested at the hillslope and at the watershed outlet for the period between 1985 and 2003. Three LU/LC databases were used: the Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover product (MODIS MOD 12 Q 1), and the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). The two <b>main</b> land <b>use</b> <b>categories</b> revealed by the three LU/LC databases were forest and agricultural lands. Whereas forest cover mechanisms were the main source of water loss in hydrology simulation, agricultural land was the main source of sediment export in sediment modeling. Land use datasets of coarser spatial resolution (MODIS and GIRAS) produced larger HSPF estimations for sediment fraction values than land use datasets identifying smaller percentages of those agricultural land cover classes (NLCD). Differences in agricultural land characterization among the land use datasets showed that sediment predictions were more sensitive than streamflow predictions to the scale and resolution of land use datasets. Choosing the right land use dataset will impact the modeling of sediments and, potentially, other water quality constituents that are related with agricultural activities...|$|R

According to the United Nation Framework Contract on Climate Change (UNFCCC) all Parties shall report periodically an update inventory of anthropogenic emissions and removals of GHG using comparable methodologies provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Additional requirements exist for reporting and accounting emissions/removals from related direct-human induced activities under the Kyoto Protocol (KP), because its accounting quantities are counted towards an international commitment reduction target. International negotiations have resulted {{in recent years in}} the adoption of new rules (e. g. mandatory accounting of Forest management) for the second commitment period of the KP (CP 2 : 2013 - 2020). Furthermore, Decision 529 / 2013 /EU, going beyond the international negotiation, added the mandatory accounting of Cropland management and Grassland management. All these changes pose new challenges that MS will need to face from 2015 (i. e. for starting to report during CP 2).

40|$|One of {{the main}} themes in the debate about global {{governance}} through private certifying partnerships regards their legitimacy. This paper argues that the <b>main</b> <b>categories</b> <b>used</b> in this debate – input and output legitimacy – largely result in a normative assessment, which does not help much with understanding better the practices of legitimating processes. As an addition to the literature focusing on legitimacy as a state of affair, this paper studies legitimacy as a dynamic process of change. To analyse these legitimation processes the paper suggests an approach based on the legitimacy challenges that the arrangements need to handle given the functions that they aim to fulfil. This approach is applied {{in a study of}} four frontrunner cases in different categories of certifying arrangements. The analysis reveals some of the drivers of legitimating processes and their relationships. It also shows the relative importance of procedural and substantive predetermined criteria to understand legitimacy issues of private regulation in the global market place.
