With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a <b>monetary</b> <b>condition</b> of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index (MCI) is {{a concept}} with a twofold use in the {{analysis}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and in the development of monetary policy strategies. The idea of this concept is that (real) interest rates are not a sufficient indicator for <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in rather small and open economies. Apart from interest rates, exchange rates also have a sig-nificant influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, the MCI combines interest rates and exchange rates to a single measurement of <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> within an economy. The MCI can be employed to measure conditions in order to evaluate monetary policy in an early stage and to give a guideline to policy makers to set their instruments and operating targets accord-ing to target final objectives such as inflation targets. The paper provides a brief introduction into the concept of the MCI and focuses on the estimation of the respective parameters of this index concept for South Africa. The estimated weights of the MCI suggest that changes of real interest rates have a 1. 9 times higher influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> than changes in real exchange rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} two {{measures of the}} monetary policy stance. The stance of monetary policy, regarded as a quantitative measure of whether Te policy is too tight, neutral, or too loose relative to objectives of stable prices and output growth, is useful and important {{for at least two}} reasons. First, it helps the authority (central bank) to determine the course of monetary policy needed to keep the objective (goals) within the target range. Secondly, a quantitative measure of the stance is important for an empirical study of the transmission of monetary policy actions through the economy. Measuring the stance of the monetary policy free from any criticism, however, is not an easy task. As pointed out by Gecchetti (1994), {{there seems to be no}} way to measure monetary actions that does not raise serious objections. Our results show that an individual coefficient <b>Monetary</b> <b>Condition</b> Index (MCI) performs better than both the summarised MCI coefficient and the Overall measure proposed by Bernanke and Mihov (1998). The results show that in the 21 -year period from 1984 to 2004, the demand shocks have dominated for about eight years. The MCI (IS-Individual coefficient) can explain six of them. However, it indicates the negative demand shock in two years as neutral. The other two measures, however, fail to capture demand shocks most of the time. This analysis suggests that the MCI (IS-Individual coefficient) plays an important role in determining output and inflation when the economy is not dominated by supply shocks. The results also show that supply shocks are dominant in the case of Pakistan. Furthermore, the exchange rate channel is more important than the interest rate channel.

40|$|C. R. Whittlesey {{points out}} that there are three kinds of ideas as to the role of money in {{economic}} growth. The first is the idea that money is an active factor {{in the sense that it}} initiates and determines, in and of itself, the processes of economic growth. The second recognizes money to be a factor conditioning the growth potentials which are determined by other real factors. The third holds that money is a passive factor, accommodating to rather than initiating or conditioning-changes in business activity. Being classified from this point of view, the monetary notions underlying most of the contemporary theories of economic growth seem to fall into the third category. But the writer thinks of money as not a passive, but a permissive factor at minimum. So, in this article, he intends to investigate the effect of monetary conditions on the process of economic growth, and obtain the consistent <b>monetary</b> <b>condition</b> with steady growth. We can observe that a very small number of writers have dealt with the problem of the relation of the <b>monetary</b> <b>condition</b> to economic growth. J. R. Hicks is one of them. He, however, gives monetary factor only a secondary importance at most and, in addition, he fails to find out any point at which monetary factor should be tied up with real factor. Neverthless, he gives us a hint for solving the problem. It is that the value of investment coefficient may vary with different monetary conditions. The most important monetary problem concerning economic growth occurs in the form of how to finance ever increasing investment. We can not ignor this financial problem. If the supply of investible fund for each individual firm is not infinitely elastic, an increase in firms' demand for fund will cause a rise in the cost of raising it, which is the result of rises both in interest payment and in subjective risk accompaning the increase of borrowed capital relative to the firms' equity capital. Any rise in the cost of raising fund, according to the hint given by Hicks, will reduce firms' investment. In multiplier-accelerator model this implies that accelerator coefficient is not a constant, but a variable depending on both interest rate and the ratio of borrowed capital to equity capital in firms' consolidated balance sheet. Hence, steady growth in multiplier-accelerator model requires appropriate <b>monetary</b> <b>condition,</b> which must be a condition allowing firms to finance adequately increasing investment for making money income grow at steady rate without a rise in the rate of interest and deterioration in firms' consolidated balance sheet. Such a condition is that money supply is increasing at the same rate as the smaller root of the system. This is the writer's conclusion attained in this article, which is different from what K. K.
