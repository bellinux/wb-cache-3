40|$|<b>Multi-wire</b> cable {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in civil engineering applications such as stay cables in suspension bridges, elevators and overhead electric transmission lines. The loss of cable load and presence of cable breakage can be catastrophic for the entire structure. Various techniques have been applied to the non-destructive monitoring of structural health of <b>multi-wire</b> cable structures. However, few of them could fully characterize the early structural degradation or reliably determine the damage mechanism due to the limited access to structural components and other environmental factors. In this thesis, a guided wave-based structural health monitoring system {{that is capable of}} monitoring the cable load levels and detecting defect simultaneously is developed for <b>multi-wire</b> cable structures. A series of finite element analysis were conducted using Abaqus/Explicit to explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to detect the notch in <b>multi-wire</b> cable structures, followed by the experimental verification on a seven wire strand. Both numerical studies and experimental works presented in this research have revealed that guided waves could be a promising technique for defect detection in <b>multi-wire</b> cable structures. On the other hand, finite element analyses were conducted in this study to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of ultrasonic guided waves in a <b>multi-wire</b> cable under different preloaded levels. The wave signals after a fast Fourier transform indicate that second harmonic peak together with the calculated nonlinear parameters decreased as the preload level increased. The corresponding wave energy was integrated to minimise the adverse influence caused by dispersion and multimodality during wave propagation. The results revealed a similar trend, which demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic guided waves to monitor the load level in <b>multi-wire</b> cable structures...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElastic guided {{waves are}} of great {{interest}} for the inspection of elongated structures. In practice, analytical or numerical modeling tools are required for {{a better understanding of}} the propagation of guided waves, which are multimodal and dispersive, and thereby for the optimization of inspection systems. However, cables are complex structures, helical, <b>multi-wired</b> and highly prestressed. This further complicates the interpretation of measurement. This paper is devoted to the modeling of wave propagation inside seven-wire strands, typically encountered in civil-engineering cables. It gives an overview of recent works, mainly conducted at Ifsttar, in order to account for the helical geometry, interwire coupling and prestress in numerical models. Then, the energy transfer from the central wire to the peripheral ones is investigated by considering an excitation localized into the central wire. The numerical results allow to understand how the energy transfer can decrease with frequency as well as to discover a new compressional mode, of local type, which could be of interest for the non-destructive evaluation or the structural health monitoring of cables...|$|E
40|$|Elastic guided {{waves are}} of {{interest}} for the non-destructive evaluation of cables. Cables are most often multi-wire structures, and understanding wave propagation requires numerical models accounting for the helical geometry of individual wires, the interwire contact mechanisms {{and the effects of}} prestress. In this paper, a modal approach based on a so-called semi-analytical finite element method and taking advantage of a biorthogonality relation is proposed in order to calculate the forced response under excitation of a cable, <b>multi-wired,</b> twisted and prestressed. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate how the energy transfers from a given wire, directly excited, to the other wires in order to identify some localization of energy inside the active wire as the waves propagate along the waveguide. The power flow of the excited field is theoretically derived and an energy transfer parameter is proposed to evaluate the level of energy localization inside a given wire. Numerical results obtained for different polarizations of excitation, central and peripheral, highlight how the energy may localize, spread or strongly change in the cross-section as waves travel along the axis. In particular, a compressional mode localized inside the central wire is found, with little dispersion and significant excitability...|$|E
40|$|Elastic guided {{waves are}} of {{interest}} for the non destructive evaluation of cables. Such structures are usually helical, <b>multi-wired</b> and highly prestressed, which greatly complicates the understanding of wave propagation from a theoretical point of view. A remarkable feature is the occurence of a missing frequency band in experimental time-frequency diagrams, {{sometimes referred to as}} notch frequency in the literature. The central frequency of this band increases under tensile loads. Recently, a numerical model has been proposed to compute the dispersion curves of prestressed helical seven-wire waveguides. Results have shown that the notch frequency indeed corresponds to a curve veering phenomenon between two longitudinal-like modes and that the increase of the notch under tensile loads is mainly due to interwire contact mechanisms. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} highlight the origin of this curve veering phenomenon, which is still unexplained up to the author's knowledge. This paper also provides further results which allow to clarify the accuracy of numerical solutions as well as the influence of contact assumptions. First, the static part of the model, necessary to compute the prestress state including contact effects, is checked from reference analytical solutions. Owing to the importance of contact, the accuracy of results is discussed both in statics and in dynamics. The influence of slip contact conditions is outlined. Then, some numerical tests are conducted by varying the Poisson coefficient and the helix lay angle. These tests allows to find out that the radial displacement constraint imposed on peripheral wires by the central one in the contact regions constitutes the main source of curve veering. More precisely, it is shown that a similar curve veering does occur for an uncoupled single peripheral wire when constrained by a radially blocked motion localised in its contact zone. Indeed, such a localised boundary condition completely breaks the circular symmetry of the wire cross-section, yielding coupling between longitudinal, flexural and torsional motion together with curve veering phenomena...|$|E

The modes of UGW propagating along the <b>multi-wire</b> ropes were identified using modelling, the dispersion curves were calculated using analytical and semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) techniques. In order to investigate the effects of UGW propagation, the two types of the acoustic contact between neighboring wires were simulated using the 3 D finite element method (FE) as well. The key question of investigation was estimation of the actual boundary conditions between neighboring wires (solid or slip) and the real depth of penetration of UGW into the overall cross-section of the rope. Therefore, in order to verify the results of FE modelling, the guided wave penetration into strands of <b>multi-wire</b> rope was investigated experimentally.
