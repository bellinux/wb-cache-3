[...] By 1855, North Conway had become [...] " [...] … the pet valley of our landscape painters. [...] There are always a dozen or <b>more</b> <b>here</b> during the sketching season, and you can hardly glance over the meadows, in any direction, without seeing one of their white umbrellas shining in the sun," [...] thus echoing Champney's own words. [...] By the 1850s, North Conway had arguably become the first artist colony in the United States. [...] Winslow Homer (18361910) depicted these artists in his 1868 painting titled [...]|$|E
500|$|Ford {{remained}} relatively {{active in the}} years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, [...] "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No <b>more</b> <b>here</b> than meets the eye." ...|$|E

A decision about whether to renew the show for a [...] would then be made based on how those four episodes performed in the ratings. David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street [...] The Unofficial Companion, credited NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield with that move, although Levinson claimed NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer was behind the decision. Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: [...] "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity {{that needs to be}} brought to the characters. There's <b>more</b> <b>here</b> than there was last year." [...] Littlefield said of Homicide, [...] "It's a show we think has tremendous potential that was not fully realized in the first nine episodes. And that's why we want to make more." ...|$|E

Near Pine City, NY328 intersects CR69, now named Pennsylvania Avenue, once <b>more.</b> <b>Here,</b> NY328 transitions from a two-lane roadway to a four-lane divided highway, a configuration that remains {{in place for the}} final [...] of the route. NY328 continues along a narrow strip of land situated {{in the center of the}} valley between CR69 and Seeley Creek to the hamlet of Southport, where it terminates at NY14. At this point, NY14 leaves Broadway and turns east onto the Clemens Center Parkway, the eastward and northward continuation of NY328 into Elmira.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{strategic}} attempts {{to form an}} [...] "Asian NATO" [...] with India, Japan, the US and Australia. The bilateral agreements have worked out {{for all but the}} Indo-Australian angle, though this has been hurt by India's refusal to sign the NPT and Australia's consequent refusal to provide India with uranium until the latter do so. However, Australia has now cleared uranium sales to India by Labour party decision in Australian parliament and by this development the relations between both the commonwealth nations are set to improve. The Australian and Indian militaries have already worked well together. Of late the {{relations between the two countries}} were jolted by sensationalised media reporting in Indian media about attacks on Indian Community students in Melbourne, Australia. Indian Government lodged strong protests with the Australian Government. Australian Prime Minister Mr. Kevin Rudd said that [...] "Australia valued its education system and International Students are valued <b>more</b> <b>here</b> in Australia." [...] Mr. Rudd though said that his Govt. has ordered a thorough probe into the attacks and also condemned it in strongest possible terms, and whilst no significant break-through was achieved immediately, during the last couple of years the attacks have been virtually eliminated by strong police enforcement and community involvement. Under the leadership of Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard the relations between both the nations have significantly improved on part due to her holistic approach in relations.|$|E
