5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{supported}} Shachtman {{were expelled}} by the emergency conference, {{with the support}} of Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P. Cannon later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{moved away}} from Jackson's downtown, in 1940 the congregation commenced {{construction of a new}} building on Woodrow Wilson Drive, while holding services at Galloway Memorial Methodist Church. The congregation moved into the new building in 1941, and dedicated it in January 1942. The sanctuary had solid walnut pews that sat 300. At the time of the move, Beth Israel's old building at South State and South was the oldest building used for religious purposes in Jackson.|$|E

5|$|A New Generation {{was made}} over a seven-month period at Nelvana's Toronto facilities, with {{additional}} work handled by Taiwan's Wang Film Productions, and involved several crew <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{worked on the}} original Care Bears Movie. Patricia Cullen served as composer, and Los Angeles musicians Dean and Carol Parks worked on the film's six songs. The Samuel Goldwyn Company, the US distributor for the first film, was originally set to release the sequel, but demands from the film's producers caused the company to give up. To the chagrin of Goldwyn's founder, the worldwide distribution rights were then acquired by Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was {{made clear that the}} Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 he {{embarked}} upon {{a series}} of drawings and watercolours of Hyde Park, which were due to be exhibited in London. Hunter hoped {{to move to the}} city permanently, as he found it livelier than Glasgow and the art market was more secure. However, his health deteriorated and he began to suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. The cause of death was cardiac failure due to blood poisoning, following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation. A member of Glasgow Art Club, work by Hunter was included in the club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935, in memory of those of its <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died since the First World War.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{joined in the}} mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove {{was denied}} entry by Canadian customs {{officials}} in the pre-race verification process, the only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> proposed it.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2013 a {{criminal}} case was opened against the band <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> participated in the Moscow cathedral performance on February 21. On March 3, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, two alleged members of Pussy Riot, were arrested by the Russian authorities and accused of hooliganism. Both women at first denied being {{members of the group}} and started a hunger strike in protest against being held in jail away from their young children. The defendants were held without bail. On March 16, another woman, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who had earlier been questioned as a witness in the case, was similarly arrested and charged.|$|E

5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006â€“10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary focus}} of the society at this time was simple subsistence. To {{continue}} as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic {{because many of the}} members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart and the other members had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.|$|E
5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{has said}} the rescue efforts of Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States {{blizzard}} of 1978 impressed him. He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard when he was 19, receiving his basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and attending Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) classes at the campus of Northeastern University. He was trained in infantry, quartermaster, and airborne duties, and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). He {{was active in the}} Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel. As the Army National Guard's head defense attorney in New England, Brown defended Guard <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests, and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones. He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, the {{reestablished}} government in Brussels attempted to disarm and demobilize the resistance. In particular, the government feared the organizations would degenerate into armed political militias which could threaten the country's political stability. In October 1944 the government ordered {{members of the}} resistance to surrender their weapons to the police and, in November, threatened to search the houses and fine those who had retained them. This provoked significant anger among resistance <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> hoped {{that they would be}} able to continue fighting alongside the Allies in the invasion of Germany. On 25 November, a large demonstration of former resistance members took place in Brussels. As the crowds moved towards the Parliament, British soldiers fired on the crowd, which they suspected to be trying to make left-wing coup d'Ã©tat. 45 people were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Though Ross was {{concerned}} about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board <b>members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll {{at the beginning of the}} 18901891 school year. Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted, though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had no running water, faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was again}} activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven {{of the ten}} original companies returned for the second period of service. <b>Members</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was {{necessary in order to}} fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.|$|E
