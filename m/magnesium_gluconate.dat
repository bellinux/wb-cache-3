Herein we presented {{a case of a}} 30 -year-old male who came with symptoms of muscle weakness, carpopedal spasms and limitation of movement which gradually progressed over 8 years. CASE REPORT: A 30 -year-old male patient presented in an outpatient department of a tertiary care centre with a complaint of severe pain in both hip joints. He had generalized muscle weakness, facial discomfort, recurrent episodes of carpopedal spasms and crampy abdominal pains. On clinical examination, the patient had Chvostek sign and Trousseau sign. Biochemical tests revealed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypomagnesemia with low plasma parathyroid hormone level. X-ray of the pelvis and spine revealed spondylarthropathic changes of long-standing hypoparathyroidism. Computed Tomography of the brain revealed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. The patient was treated with intravenous calcium <b>gluconate,</b> <b>magnesium</b> and oral vitamin D 3. On follow-up the patient showed improvement of muscle weakness and carpopedal spasm with near-normal biochemical parameters. However, there was no improvement in symptoms related to spondyloarthropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder with clinic and biochemical features of hypocalcemia. Long- standing hypoparathyroidism can cause spondyloarthropathic changes closely resembling ankylosing spondylitis and DISH. Skeletal changes of long-standing hypoparathyroidism are irreversible.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{additive}} {{solution for}} substitution of plasma for storage of leukodepleted platelet concentrates can have many advantages. In this study, a comparison was made between two platelet additive solutions: one containing citrate and acetate (PAS-II), the other also supplemented with additional salts such as <b>magnesium,</b> and with <b>gluconate</b> (Composol-PS). Donor-dependent differences were avoided by applying a paired experimental design (n = 10). The platelet concentrates were prepared by pooling five buffy coats and the additive solution, and prestorage filtration was utilized to remove leucocytes to well below 1 x 106. Storage of platelet concentrates up to 9 days after blood collection revealed that platelet concentrates in Composol-PS maintained an almost constant pH of on average 6. 93 from day 2 through day 7, and at 6. 90 at day 9. This was in contrast to PAS-II, which showed a gradually decreasing pH from on average 6. 97 at day 1 to 6. 86 at day 9. In all units stored in both solutions the swirling effect was present during 9 days of storage.

A critical barrier to {{progress has been}} the lack of readily available and reproducible envenomation assays that (1) recapitulate live-tentacle stings; (2) allow quantitation and imaging of cnidae discharge; (3) allow primary quantitation of venom toxicity; and (4) employ rigorous controls. We report the implementation of an integrated array of three experimental approaches {{designed to meet the}} above-stated criteria. Mechanistically overlapping, yet distinct, the three approaches comprised (1) direct application of test solutions on live tentacles (termed tentacle solution assay, or TSA) with single image- and video-microscopy; (2) spontaneous stinging assay using freshly excised tentacles overlaid on substrate of live human red blood cells suspended in agarose (tentacle blood agarose assays, or TBAA); and (3) a “skin” covered adaptation of TBAA (tentacle skin blood agarose assay, or TSBAA). We report the use and results of these assays to evaluate the efficacy of topical first-aid approaches to inhibit tentacle firing and venom activity. TSA results included the potent stimulation of massive cnidae discharge by alcohols but only moderate induction by urine, freshwater, and “cola” (carbonated soft drink).

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of {{acute renal failure}} (ARF) in the hospital setting is increasing. It portends excessive morbidity and mortality and a considerable burden on hospital resources. Extracorporeal therapies show promise {{in the management of}} patients with shock and ARF. It is said that the potential of such therapy goes beyond just providing renal support. The aim of our study was to analyze the clinical setting and outcomes of critically ill ARF patients managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Patients and Methods: Ours was a retrospective study of 50 patients treated between January 2004 and November 2005. These 50 patients were in clinical shock and had concomitant ARF. All of these patients underwent CVVHDF (continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration) in the intensive care unit. For the purpose of this study, shock was defined as systolic BP < 100 mm Hg in spite of administration of one or more inotropic agents. SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score before initiation of dialysis support was recorded in all cases. CVVHDF was performed using the Diapact &#x 00 AE; (Braun) CRRT machine. The vascular access used was as follows: femoral in 32, internal jugular in 8, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in 4, and subclavian in 6 patients. We used 0. 9 &#x 0025; or 0. 45 &#x 0025; (half-normal) saline as a prefilter replacement, with addition of 10 &#x 0025; calcium <b>gluconate,</b> <b>magnesium</b> sulphate, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride in separate units, while maintaining careful monitoring of electrolytes. Anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit was achieved with systemic heparin in 26 patients; frequent saline flushes were used in the other 24 patients. Results: Of the 50 patients studied, 29 were males and 21 females (1. 4 : 1). The average age was 52. 88 years (range: 20 - 75 years). Causes of ARF included sepsis in 24 (48 &#x 0025;), hemodynamically mediated renal failure (HMRF) in 18 (36 &#x 0025;), and acute over chronic kidney disease in 8 (16 &#x 0025;) patients. The overall mortality was 74 &#x 0025;. The average SOFA score was 14. 31. The variables influencing mortality on multivariate analysis were: age [odds ratio (OR) : 1. 65; 95 &#x 0025; CI: 1. 35 to 1. 92; P = 0. 04], serum creatinine (OR: 1. 68; 95 &#x 0025; CI: 1. 44 to 1. 86; P = 0. 03), and serum bicarbonate (OR: 0. 76; 95 &#x 0025; CI: 0. 55 to 0. 94; P = 0. 01). On univariate analysis the SOFA score was found to be a useful predictor of mortality. Conclusions: Despite advances in treating critically ill patients with newer extracorporeal therapies, mortality is dismally high. Multiorgan dysfunction adversely affects outcome of CRRT.

Objective: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that magnesium salts, including the sulphate and chloride forms, are neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recently, studies in cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion injury have demonstrated that the gluconate salt of magnesium may provide superior protection against oxidative damage and postischaemic dysfunction than MgSO 4. We have therefore compared the efficacy of both MgSO 4 and <b>magnesium</b> <b>gluconate</b> (MgGl 2) on outcome following diffuse TBI in rats. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injured using the 2 -metre impact acceleration model of diffuse TBI. At 30 min after injury, animals were administered with either 250 µmoles/kg i. v. MgSO 4, MgGl 2, or equal volume saline vehicle. Thereafter, animals were assessed for motor and cognitive outcome using the rotarod and Barnes maze, respectively, or their brains removed at 3 days after TBI and used for histological examination. Results: Treatment with either magnesium salt significantly improved functional outcome as compared to vehicle treated controls. Similarly, treatment with either magnesium salt attenuated the degree of histological dark cell change at 3 days after TBI relative to the vehicle treated animals. There {{were no significant differences between}} the magnesium treated groups. Conclusions: We conclude that MgSO 4 and MgGl 2 are equally neuroprotective following TBI. Our results suggest that MgGl 2 may only be more effective in conditions that produce ischaemia, where high concentrations of reactive oxygen species are generated. Renee J. Turner, K. W. DaSilva, C.

Biofield Energy Healing significantly enhanced the cell viability as compared with the untreated formulation. The expression of TNF-α was significantly inhibited in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0. 01053, 0. 1053, and 1. 053 µg/mL by 1. 77 %, 1. 93 %, and 3. 55 %, respectively compared with the untreated formulation. The rest of the tested concentrations of the Biofield Treated formulation showed an increase in TNF-α expression at 0. 00001053, 0. 0001053, and 0. 001053 µg/mL by 7. 26 %, 8. 50 %, and 8. 50 %, respectively compared to the vehicle control group. Similarly, the MIP- 1 α expression was inhibited by the Biofield Energy Treated formulation and showed immunosuppression activity at 0. 01053 µg/mL by 18. 47 % (p≤ 0. 001) compared to the untreated formulation. MIP- 1 α expression was reported as 628. 94 ± 13. 0 pg/mL in the untreated formulation, while it decreased to 512. 74 ± 1. 9 pg/mL in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0. 01053 µg/mL. In addition, the IL- 1 β secretion was also significantly inhibited by the Biofield Treated formulation at concentrations 0. 001053, 0. 01053, 0. 1053, and 1. 053 µg/mL by 72. 02 %, 50. 16 %, 30. 68 %, and 22. 11 %, respectively as compared with the untreated formulation. Overall, The Trivedi Effect® significantly down-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the treated formulation, which can be better utilized in organ transplants, anti-aging, stress management, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory disorders, etc. to modulate the immune system by improving overall health...|$|E
