5000|$|Il Girasole has two storeys and {{is shaped}} like the letter ‘L.’ It sits on an over 44 metre {{circular}} base, with a 42 metre tall tower at the centre. This {{is where the}} house rotates from, using motors. The ‘L’ rotates “over three circular tracks where 15 trolleys can slide the 5,000 cubic metres building at a speed of 4 mm per second and it takes 9 hours and 20 minutes to rotate fully”. [...] There is a <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> located in the moving {{part of the house}} that is used to control its rotation. The first floor of the moving part is known as the “day zone,” and includes the dining room, the music room, Mr. and Mrs. Invernizzi’s studies, with the kitchen, pantry, and toilet located right near the central tower. An assortment of bedrooms and bathrooms are found on the second floor. [...] Villa Girasole’s interior design is such that one experiences a number of different progressions of light throughout the day: “Though the views from either wing differ at any given moment, they share a general orientation to the sun, reducing the chance for conflict over which direction the house should point. All rooms could share an equal amount of daylight or shade”.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{objectives}} of this project {{is to build a}} connection line between the university and the important Industrial corporations in the Sudan. The project also aims to get use of the unused robots by first applying all experiments and tests on one of them; if the tests succeed they can be generalized to other robots. There is another special aim of the project is that it provides a good chance to deal with work environment. In 1997 the management of an industrial complex bought six industrial robots to be used for carrying heavy loads on its various factories. They were secondhand and no body knows how to operate them. Great efforts were done by the complex maintenance engineers to repair these robots by contacting the manufacturer. Unfortunately they made in USA, by UNIMATE Company and for politic reasons the connection was cut. The problem was to study how they work; it was a problem because there was only one source for information, the attached manual. In addition to the manual you must take a course in UNIMATE institute to be able to just operate the robot and carryout the periodic maintenance. So, to repair the original system or change it you will face many difficulties, starting from the spare parts until the required software. Therefore, from the beginning our opinion was to change the old control system, in spite of that we try to repair the old system but we failed. The next step was to focus our efforts on operating the robot manually, new problems appear here, the type and amount of the input signal and to which terminals it must be supplied. All the work was done on one robot and we succeeded in operating it. A <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> was designed Finally a general design is introduced to the new control system in which we use the microcontroller.

It is visually distinctive from previous versions with its stealthy housing, which also protects the gun from weather and allows for easier access to internal components through large access panels. The Mod 3 mounts a larger Alliant Techsystems Mk44 Bushmaster II 30 mm cannon for a 500-meter range increase, {{as well as a}} coaxial M2 [...]50 caliber machine gun. Elevation is increased to +75 degrees for engaging UAVs and helicopters, and ammunition storage is greater at 420 30 mm rounds. Other features include a larger <b>manual</b> fire <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> an offset mode specifically for firing warning shots, and a surveillance mode where the gun can be pointed away from a target but the EO sensor remains pointed in the target direction. Although it has a high degree of commonality and has the same footprint as previous models, the Mod 3 is 20 percent heavier due to greater ammo load.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a system for automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of chicken farm equipment. The system uses a RPI (Raspberry Pi) computer, with a built in electronic circuit control and a web interface. The purpose of electronic wiring of components is for reading the water level, temperature and lighting control. This system contains several types of sensors, relay modules, some basic electronic components and a solenoid water valve. These components are connected to the RPI computer via GPIO (general purpose input output) pins. System status is constantly being logged into the database via the API (application programming interface). The RPI computer runs a script in Python programming language, which controls the components. The system provides automatic control based on pre-specified rules, which vary with the age of chickens. <b>Manual</b> <b>control</b> is also possible by changing the settings in the <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> available to registered users. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} equipment {{used in the}} Operating Room (OR) asks for ergonomical user interfaces. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate in a pelvi-trainer setting the efficiency, reliability and user satisfaction of voice <b>control,</b> touch <b>panel</b> <b>control</b> and conventional <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> by an assistant. Ten subjects had to control the zoom and light intensity of an endoscope, using voice, a touch panel or an assistant. For each interface, the subject received nine tasks to control to a certain level, light, zoom or both. The experiment was repeated three times (three cycles) and the sequences of interfaces were varied per cycle. Experiments were recorded on video and off-line time needed per task and the number of wrongly interpreted tasks were measured. A questionnaire was used to investigate user satisfaction. Voice control was slower than assistant <b>control</b> and touch <b>panel</b> <b>control</b> (92. 5 s, 80. 2 s and 76. 0 s, respectively, p < 0. 02). There was no significant difference between touch <b>panel</b> <b>control</b> and assistant control. With voice control, 3. 1 % of the commands were not interpreted and 1. 7 % were wrongly interpreted. 40 % of the subjects experienced voice control as the quickest, 30 % touch <b>panel</b> <b>control</b> and 30 % assistant control. 48 % of the subjects preferred voice control, 28 % the touch panel and 24 % assistant control. Voice control was less efficient than touch <b>panel</b> <b>control</b> and <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> by an assistant. The subjects experienced voice control as more efficient, however. In the future, voice control should be improved to overcome wrongly interpreted commands.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a concepts, guidelines, a toolset {{and experiences}} with defining and implementing on-line visual displays of software development progress, <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> group sets of measurement visualizations providing a multi-dimensional, integrated view of development status. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> are developed at various organizational levels, serving the information needs of different stakeholders. Navigation between different <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> enables users to drill down to view more detailed information on, e. g., a particular project {{or on the}} progress of a particular development activity. In the constructive part of the work, I describe concepts, and a toolset {{that can be used for}} defining and implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> In addition, I provide guidelines for grouping measures into <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> and discuss how measurement programs can be partitioned into <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> The toolset, built as a "proof-of-concept" consists of a central measurement database, a visualization client, and a set of data importers that transfer data from external corporate repositories into the measurement database. The empirical part discusses our efforts to define and implement <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in four high-technology companies in Finland. Framed in the context of "constructive action research", the cases are first described individually, according to the main steps of the action research cycle, then compared in a cross-case analysis. Our results—we succeeded in implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in only one of four organizations—indicate that the development of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> requires a substantial investment and commitment by the organization, but that it can be feasible even in small organizations. The main obstacles hindering the implementation were organizational and human in nature, and more related to measurement program implementation in general than to tool support per se. Interestingly, the organizations did not consider measurement definition, i. e., the selection of "metrics" to be problematic. Success factors identified included management commitment, dedicated measurement personnel, and organizational change management. While limited, our experiences with the use of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> show that they were felt to be more valuable by management than by the collocated project personnel. We thus hypothesise that the usefulness of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> increases with project size and geographical distance. In the future it would be interesting to develop <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for distributed software development projects, in which informal status communication is more difficult. reviewe...|$|R
