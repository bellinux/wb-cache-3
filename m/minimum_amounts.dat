25|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee <b>minimum</b> <b>amounts</b> of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires {{were the first}} item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board {{was set up to}} coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.|$|E
25|$|As Tayler (2003) mentions, {{demutualisation}} moves succeeded immediately {{because neither}} Conservative nor Labour party UK governments created a framework which put obstacles {{in the way}} of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest {{in the case of the}} position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging <b>minimum</b> <b>amounts</b> of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating Building Societies Act 1986 contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.|$|E

50|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>Amount</b> ProvisionThe <b>minimum</b> <b>amount</b> {{provision}} {{is relevant to}} certain monthly pension benefit and ASA distribution options. The <b>minimum</b> <b>amount</b> {{provision is}} in place to guarantee that a member or that member's beneficiary will receive benefit payments that total at least {{the balance of the}} member's Annuity Savings Account (ASA) at the time of retirement. If a member does not receive this <b>minimum</b> <b>amount</b> in combined annuity and pension payments during his or her lifetime, the member's beneficiary can claim the remaining amount due. For example, if a member has $100,000 in her ASA at the time of retirement, this member's total benefits (combined annuity and pension payments) must equal $100,000 or the member's beneficiary may claim the difference.|$|R

2500|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the {{organization}} that regulates collegiate wrestling. The wrestling rules developed by the NCAA are followed by each of the NCAA's three divisions. In addition, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) have also adopted them, with some modifications. The NCAA generally sets the standard for weight classes for college-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. There are currently 10 main weight classes currently open to college-level competition, ranging from 125lb to the Heavyweight division that ranges from 183lb to 285lb. Also, there is a 235lb weight class, which only the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, {{the organization}} that governs college wrestling for institutions outside the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, currently allows that ranges from 174lb to 235lb. The NCWA also allows eight weight classes for women ranging from 105lb to 200lb. A wrestler must normally have his weight assessed {{by a member of}} the institution's athletics medical staff (e.g. a physician, certified athletic trainer, or registered dietician) before the first official team practice. [...] The weight assessed is then his minimum weight class. The athletics medical staff member and the head coach then review all of the assessed weights of the wrestling team members and certify them online at the website of the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the certification, the wrestler may not compete below that weight class and may only compete at one weight class higher than his minimum weight. If a wrestler does gain weight over his certified weight class and wrestles at two weight classes above it, he forfeits his previous lowest weight class for the one weight class below where he wrestled. If a contestant wishes to weigh-in and wrestle at only one weight class above his certified weight class and later return to his lowest certified weight class, he may do so. However, the wrestler may only return to that certified weight class according to the weight-loss plan of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. This weight loss plan takes into account potential dehydration during the wrestling season and <b>minimum</b> <b>amounts</b> of body fat. All of this has been done in order to protect the wrestler's health and safety.|$|E
