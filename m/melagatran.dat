40|$|ObjectiveMelagatran, {{the active}} form of ximelagatran, is a novel, direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor {{that does not}} have a narrow therapeutic window regarding hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events. We aimed to determine whether <b>melagatran</b> would be effective in preventing thrombus formation on heterotopically placed mechanical heart valves. MethodsA graft containing a bileaflet mechanical heart valve was implanted in the descending thoracic aorta of domestic swine. Two groups of 6 animals received daily subcutaneous injections of either <b>melagatran</b> (2. 4 mg/kg, 3 times per day) or dalteparin (175 U/kg, 2 times per day) for 30 days. Four control animals received no anticoagulation therapy. Fecal HemoQuant and serum hemoglobin levels were recorded. Thirty days after the procedure, platelets were labeled with indium 111, the abdominal organs were inspected, and thrombi and platelets deposited on the valve were measured. ResultsMedian thrombus burden on the valves was 0. 4 mg (interquartile range, 0. 15 - 5. 45 mg) with <b>melagatran,</b> 0. 5 mg (interquartile range, 0 - 14. 5 mg) with dalteparin, and 168 mg (interquartile range, 32. 5 - 665. 75 mg) for controls (<b>melagatran</b> vs dalteparin and control; P =. 04). Median platelet deposition on the valves was 0 (interquartile range, 0 - 8. 9 × 104) with <b>melagatran,</b> 49. 9 × 104 (interquartile range, 27. 9 × 104 - 191. 8 × 104) with dalteparin, and 115. 2 × 104 (interquartile range, 9. 6 × 104 - 243 × 104) for controls (<b>melagatran</b> vs dalteparin and control; P =. 02). <b>Melagatran</b> did not increase the risk of thromboembolism or bleeding.

The aim of our in vitro study was to investigate the effect of a direct thrombin inhibitor compared with dalteparin and UFH on human osteoblasts. Materials and Methods: <b>Melagatran,</b> dalteparin and UFH were added to primary osteoblast cultures in their therapeutic range and two decimal powers below and above. Cell number, protein synthesis, mitochondrial and alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen type I synthesis were evaluated. Results: <b>Melagatran</b> showed the least influence on protein synthesis and cell proliferation with a reduction of cell number to 83. 5 ± 9 % (p = 0. 027) of the control group only in the highest investigated concentration after 15 days of incubation. Mitochondrial and alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen type I synthesis in osteoblasts incubated with <b>melagatran</b> and dalteparin showed similar patterns. UFH showed the most pronounced influence on cellular metabolism. Conclusions: <b>Melagatran</b> showed less inhibitory in vitro effects on human osteoblasts than dalteparin or UFH.

In a single-blind, randomized, parallel-group study, volunteers (20 per group) received a 5 -hour intravenous (i. v.) infusion to achieve steady-state <b>melagatran</b> plasma concentrations of approximately 0. 5 micromol/L, with a single i. v. bolus of rFVIIa (90 microg/kg) or placebo at 60 minutes. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, thrombin-anti-thrombin complex, fibrinopeptide A, beta-thromboglobulin, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor were quantified for venous and shed blood. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), endogenous thrombin potential, thrombus precursor protein (TpP), and plasmin-alpha(2) -antiplasmin complex concentrations were determined in venous blood.

40|$|Introduction: Ximelagatran is a novel, oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor that {{is currently}} being investigated for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical effects of <b>melagatran,</b> the active form of ximelagatran, in patients with both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Materials and methods: In this open-label study, 12 patients received a fixed dose of 48 mg oral ximelagatran twice daily for 6 - 9 days. Plasma samples were collected for determination of <b>melagatran</b> concentrations and scintigraphic changes and adverse events were recorded. Results: Peak plasma concentrations of <b>melagatran</b> were attained approximately 2 h after administration of ximelagatran. <b>Melagatran</b> plasma concentration profiles were similar on Days 1, 2, and 6 - 9. Plasma {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} increased following administration of ximelagatran and reached a peak that was approximately twofold higher than the predose activated partial thromboplastin time and correlated with <b>melagatran</b> plasma concentrations (R- 2 = 0. 69). All but one patient (with malignancy) showed regressed or unchanged lung scintigraphic findings, and six of these demonstrated no, or only minor, perfusion defects at central evaluation after 6 - 9 days of ximelagatran treatment. Clinical symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnoea, cough, and oedema, and pain in the affected leg, were improved. Ximelagatran was well tolerated with no deaths or severe bleeding events reported during treatment. Conclusion: Treatment with a fixed dose of oral ximelagatran, used without routine coagulation monitoring, showed reproducible pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with a rapid onset of action and promising clinical results in patients with pulmonary embolism...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCI) performed worldwide {{has increased dramatically}} during the last decade. Complication rates have decreased over time, however the restenosis phenomenon remains an unsolved issue. Thrombin is the key regulator in the pro-coagulant state following PCI. As well as its role in coagulation activation, thrombin also promotes proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, which is of pivotal importance in the restenosis process. Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to determine if thrombin inhibition, achieved through antithrombin (AT) or the direct, small molecule thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran,</b> could favourably alter the acute- and long-term response to deep vessel wall injury in porcine coronary arteries. Methods: In three studies on the acute response to vessel wall injury, the effects of locally delivered AT, and locally or systemically delivered <b>melagatran,</b> were investigated. After local delivery by special local drug delivery catheters, the content of AT in the vessel wall was quantified by immunofluorescence technique using a semi-quantitative method, and that of <b>melagatran</b> was analysed by autoradiography. Autologus platelets were labelled with In 111 and infused into the pigs. In addition, in the study with systemically infused <b>melagatran,</b> I 125 labelled fibrinogen was injected. A balloon injury was induced to the coronary vessel wall. One hour after balloon injury the pigs were sacrificed, the heart explanted and the radio-activity of the injured vessel segments investigated in a gamma well counter. The number of platelets and amount of fibrin was calculated. In two other studies, the effects of locally delivered AT or high concentration, high purity antithrombin fraction (HCHP-AT), on the long-term response, i. e. development of stenosis, after deep coronary artery wall injury, were investigated. Normo-cholesterolemic Swedish landrace pigs were subjected to a deep balloon or stent injury to the coronary vessel walls and then followed for four weeks, whereafter they were sacrificed. In a sixth study using a double-injury model, hypercholesterolemic Yucatan mini-pigs were treated with a long-term infusion of <b>melagatran</b> after balloon injury or implant of stents in the coronary arteries. The animals were followed for four weeks before being sacrificed. In the three latter studies, the hearts were explanted after sacrifice and the injured vessel segments investigated histo-morphologically. The percent area stenosis, lumen and the different vessel wall areas were determined. In the study with HCHP-AT, an additional quantitative coronary angiogram (QCA) was performed. Results: Local delivery of antithrombin after balloon injury in coronary vessels resulted in detectable amounts of AT in the inner part of the vessel wall, and a significant reduction of platelet deposition as compared to control treatment with pure albumin. It was not possible to deposit any <b>melagatran</b> by local delivery and there was no effect on platelet deposition. Systemically administered <b>melagatran,</b> on the other hand, significantly inhibited both platelet and fibrin deposition in an acute model. There was no favourable effect on vascular wall remodelling or neointima proliferation after coronary vascular wall injury by either local delivery of AT or HCHP-AT nor of long term infusion of <b>melagatran.</b> Conclusions: Thrombin inhibition by either local administration of endogenous antithrombin or systematically administered low molecular weight thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran,</b> inhibited the acute thrombotic response after vascular wall injury in porcine coronary models, but there were no effects on long-term stenosis/restenosis development.

40|$|The {{drawbacks}} of today's anticoagulants are parenteral use (heparins), {{a narrow}} interval between efficacy and bleeding, {{and the high}} variability of effect with a consequent need for frequent monitoring (coumarins). The aim of the current studies was to evaluate properties important for efficacy and safety of novel anticoagulants, as exemplified by direct thrombin inhibitors, with non-clinical methods. The focus was on the direct thrombin inhibitors inogatran and <b>melagatran.</b> The efficacy, selectivity and safety of the anticoagulants were investigated by using in vivo models of venous and arterial thrombosis, exogenous thrombolysis, endogenous fibrinolysis and bleeding time measurements. The findings were compared with the results obtained in biochemical assays ex vivo and in vitro. Efficacy. Based on similar prolongations of {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) inogatran, argatroban and heparin were equipotent in a venous thrombosis model. A decrease in the enzyme inhibition constant (Ki) obtained in vitro for <b>melagatran</b> compared with inogatran, led to an increased potency for <b>melagatran</b> in the arterial thrombosis model in vivo, while a similar antithrombotic effect was obtained for <b>melagatran</b> and hirudin despite a large difference in the Ki-values. For thrombin inhibitors, a relationship was found between steep dose-response curves and low association rate constants between thrombin and the inhibitor. Warfarin was also found to have a steep dose-response curve. Selectivity. In rats exogenous fibrinolysis, obtained by administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), or endogenous fibrinolysis was either facilitated or inhibited depending on the degree of selectivity against the fibrinolytic system. The results suggest that the ratio of the Ki-values of fibrinolytic enzymes to the required plasma concentration needed in vivo must be used to differentiate thrombin inhibitors rather than the selectivity against thrombin. Safety. Inogatran and <b>melagatran</b> seemed to have a wider separation of antithrombotic effect and bleeding time compared with warfarin. Feiba, a coagulation factor concentrate containing a mixture of coagulation factors, was found to be effective, without being prothrombotic, in reversing the anticoagulant effect of <b>melagatran.</b> Conclusion: For direct thrombin inhibitors to be effective and safe, potent, rapid and selective inhibition of thrombin is needed. Excessive thrombin inhibition can be reversed by prothrombin complex concentrates...|$|E

In this study, the hypothesis that a specific thrombin inhibitor, Melaga-tran, could reduce IBMIR in an in vitro model in which human islets are exposed to ABO-compatible blood was tested.

40|$|For {{prevention}} and treatment of thrombotic diseases with an anticoagulant drug {{it is important that}} an adequate dose is given to avoid occurrence or recurrence of thrombosis, without increasing the risk of bleeding and other adverse events to unacceptable levels. The aim of this thesis was to develop mathematical models that describe the dose-concentration (pharmacokinetic) and concentration-response (pharmacodynamic) relationships of direct thrombin inhibitors, in order to estimate optimal dosages for treatment and long-term secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were developed, based on data from clinical investigations in healthy volunteers and patients receiving intravenous inogatran, subcutaneous <b>melagatran</b> and/or its oral prodrug ximelagatran. The benefit-risk profiles of different ximelagatran dosages were estimated using clinical utility functions. These functions were based on the probabilities and fatal consequences of thrombosis, bleeding and elevation of the hepatic enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). The studies demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of <b>melagatran</b> and ximelagatran were predictable and well correlated to renal function. The coagulation marker, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), increased non-linearly with increasing thrombin inhibitor plasma concentration. Overall, the systemic <b>melagatran</b> exposure (AUC) and APTT were similarly predictive of thrombosis and bleedings. The identified relationship between the risk of ALAT-elevation and <b>melagatran</b> AUC suggests that the incidence approaches a maximum at high exposures. The estimated clinical utility was favourable compared to placebo in the overall study population and in special subgroups of patients following fixed dosing of ximelagatran for long-term secondary prevention of VTE. Individualized dosing was predicted to add limited clinical benefit in this indication. The models developed can be used to support the studied dosage and for selection of alternative dosing strategies that may improve the clinical outcome of ximelagatran treatment. In addition, the models may be extrapolated to aid the dose selection in clinical trials with other direct thrombin inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} (ARF) affects 5 - 20 % of {{critically}} ill patients {{and is an}} independent risk factor for death in this patient population. Reactive oxygen species, thrombin and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) are increased in ARF, and could {{contribute to the development}} of kidney failure and the poor prognosis. The aim of these studies was to investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an antioxidant), thrombin inhibition and ET- 1 receptor blockade on renal hemodynamics and function in experimental models of ischemic and septic ARF in rats. N-acetylcysteine was studied in a model of renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury induced by renal arterial clamping. N-acetylcysteine improved glomerular filtration rate (GFR) day 1 and 3 after IR. Furthermore, NAC decreased renal interstitial inflammation. N-acetylcysteine-treated rats had preserved renal glutathione levels and decreased plasma ascorbyl radical concentrations, indicating improved intrarenal antioxidant capacity and attenuated systemic oxidative stress. However, NAC did not improve GFR, total renal blood flow (RBF), or cortical (CLDF) and outer medullary (OMLDF) perfusion measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, during the first 80 minutes after IR. Thrombin inhibition with <b>melagatran</b> was examined in endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide infusion, and in renal IR. During the first 3 h of endotoxemia, <b>melagatran</b> improved OMLDF, but did not attenuate the decline in GFR, RBF, CLDF and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In addition, <b>melagatran</b> attenuated the increase in plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin, and of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. <b>Melagatran</b> did not diminish hepatocellular necrosis or the elevated hepatic gene expression of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In renal IR, <b>melagatran</b> did not ameliorate the decline in renal function, or attenuate renal histopathological abnormalities. We studied the renal effects of selective endothelin type A (ETA), and type B (ETB), receptor antagonists during the first 2 h of normotensive endotoxemia with acute renal dysfunction. In saline-treated rats, endotoxin induced an approximate 40 % reduction in GFR, without significant changes in MAP, RBF, or in cortical perfusion and pO 2, measured by oxygen sensitive microelectrodes. In addition, endotoxin increased outer medullary perfusion and pO 2. Neither selective, nor combined, ETA and ETB receptor blockade improved GFR. However, in rats receiving selective ETB receptor antagonist, or combined ETA and ETB receptor blockade, endotoxin produced marked reductions in RBF and CLDF, without affecting MAP. In conclusion, NAC is renoprotective in renal IR presumably by decreasing renal oxidative stress and inflammation, but not by improving kidney hemodynamics early after the ischemic insult. Thrombin seems not to be an important pathogenetic factor in the development of renal IR-injury. Thrombin inhibition with <b>melagatran</b> during endotoxemia preserves renal outer medullary perfusion, ameliorates liver dysfunction and attenuates the systemic inflammatory response. Endothelin- 1 has beneficial effects on renal hemodynamics during early normotensive endotoxemia by activation of ETB receptors that exert a renal vasodilator influence and contribute to maintain normal RBF...|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{delivery}} is a feasible alternative to oral or parenteral administration for some drugs {{because of the}} high permeability of the nasal epithelium, rapid drug absorption across this membrane and avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate factors influencing the permeability of the nasal mucosa to various compounds and to evaluate implications for drug absorption via the nasal route. Porcine nasal mucosa mounted in an Ussing chamber system was established as an in vitro model, and glucose, insulin, lidocaine, mannitol, <b>melagatran,</b> nicotine, PEG 4000, propranolol, sumatriptan, verapamil, vinblastine and an aminodiether were used as model compounds. The pharmacokinetics of <b>melagatran</b> and propiomazine were investigated in absorption studies in rats, and the influence of the enhancers SDS and EDTA on <b>melagatran</b> absorption was evaluated and compared with in vitro permeability data. The expression of P-glycoprotein in porcine nasal mucosa was investigated and compared with that in human nasal epithelial biopsies using the Western Blot technique. The results demonstrated that the Ussing chamber model using porcine nasal mucosa has potential as a tool for evaluating mechanisms of nasal absorption and predicting the in vivo effects of absorption enhancers. Moreover, porcine nasal mucosa is comparable to human nasal mucosa in its morphology and P-glycoprotein expression. The in vitro permeability data were found to weakly correlate with literature data on human absorption after nasal administration of the corresponding compounds. In vivo absorption studies of the sedative propiomazine demonstrated that nasal administration of this drug offers an interesting alternative to the oral formulation currently on the market, since the absorption was rapid and the bioavailability was promising. The bioavailability of <b>melagatran</b> in rats was moderate but variable, and responded to the addition of enhancers. Finally, the establishment and characterisation of an in vitro method for prediction of nasal drug absorption, and the investigation of factors influencing nasal membrane permeability and absorption offer substantial contributions for nasal drug delivery...|$|E

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{computational}} chemistry {{have been used}} to elucidate the molecular properties of coumarinic anticoagulants (acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, warfarin and tecarfarin) and direct thrombin inhibitors (<b>melagatran,</b> dabigatran and their prodrug forms, ximelagatran and dabigatran etexilate). The geometries and energies of these drugs have been computed at the Becke 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory. In the case of the vitamin K antagonists (acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, warfarin and tecarfarin), the most stable tautomer in both the gas-phase and water solution is tautomer A, which contains the 4 -hydroxycoumarin moiety. The R(+) -enantiomer of this tautomer is the most stable structure in warfarin and acetocoumarol. For phenprocoumon, the S(-) -enantiomer was the most stable species. The computed dissociation constants show that these drugs are almost completely ionized at physiological pH = 7. 4. Tecarfarin is the vitamin K antagonist with the highest lipophilicity. The prodrugs ximelagatran and dabigatran etexilate are described as lipophilic drugs. The prodrugs' metabolites, <b>melagatran</b> and dabigatran, are substantially less lipophilic. The relatively high polar surface area value of acenocoumarol (113. 3) results in lessened absorption in comparison with warfarin. Phenprocoumon, with PSA value 50. 4, had the highest calculated absorption of all of the anticoagulants in the study.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if there is a synergistic effect of a combination of P 2 Y 12 and P 2 Y 1 inhibition and P 2 Y 12 and thrombin inhibition, on ADP- and thrombin-induced platelet activation, respectively. The rationale being that these combinations will cause a concurrent inhibition of both Gαq and Gαi signalling. Blood from healthy volunteers was preincubated with AR-C 69931 MX, a reversible P 2 Y 12 antagonist; MRS 2179, a reversible P 2 Y 1 antagonist; or <b>melagatran,</b> a direct reversible thrombin inhibitor; alone or in various combinations prior to activation with ADP or thrombin. Platelet function in whole blood was assessed by flow cytometry using the antibody PAC- 1 to estimate the expression of active αIIbβ 3 (the fibrinogen receptor GPIIb/IIIa). A synergistic effect was evaluated by comparing the concentrations in the different combinations with those of corresponding equipotent concentrations of each single inhibitor alone. The equipotent single concentrations were experimentally obtained from concentration response curves performed in parallel. A synergistic effect regarding inhibition of ADP-induced platelet activation (10 μM) was obtained with different combinations of AR-C 69931 MX and MRS 2179. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activation (2 nM) with combinations of AR-C 69931 MX and the thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran</b> did also result in a strong synergistic effect. To our knowledge, this is the first time that data supporting a synergistic effect has been published for the inhibitor combinations described. Whether this synergistic effect in vitro also results in an improved antithrombotic effect in vivo with or without an increased risk of bleeding remains to be studied in well-conducted clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{effects of}} ximelagatran, an oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor (DTI), recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin) and enoxaparin on thrombin generation and platelet activation were studied in humans. BackgroundRecombinant hirudin (parenteral DTI) and enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) {{have been demonstrated}} to be clinically effective in acute coronary syndromes. Ximelagatran is currently under investigation for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. The shed blood model allows {{for the study of}} thrombin generation and platelet activation in humans in vivo. MethodsThis was an open-label, parallel-group study involving 120 healthy male volunteers randomized to receive one of three oral doses of ximelagatran (15, 30 or 60 mg), r-hirudin (intravenous) or enoxaparin (subcutaneous) at doses demonstrated to be clinically effective in acute coronary syndromes, or to serve as a control. Thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 [F 1 + 2] and thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT]) and platelet activation (β-thromboglobulin [β-TG]) biomarkers were studied using a shed blood model involving blood collection from skin incisions made using standardized bleeding time devices. ResultsOral ximelagatran, intravenous r-hirudin and subcutaneous enoxaparin rapidly and significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased F 1 + 2, TAT and β-TG levels in shed blood, indicating inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet activation. Statistically significant concentration (<b>melagatran,</b> the active form of ximelagatran) -response relationships for F 1 + 2 (p = 0. 005), TAT (p = 0. 005) and β-TG (p < 0. 001) levels, with IC 50 s of 0. 376 (F 1 + 2), 0. 163 (TAT) and 0. 115 (β-TG) μmol/l, were detected. <b>Melagatran</b> showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with low variability. All drugs were well tolerated. ConclusionsOral administration of the DTI ximelagatran resulted in a rapid inhibition of both thrombin generation and platelet activation in a concentration-dependent manner using a human shed blood model. The inhibition of thrombin generation by 60 mg ximelagatran was comparable to that observed with doses of r-hirudin and enoxaparin demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of newly {{developed}} platelet aggregation inhibitors and anticoagulants are currently being investigated in clinical studies. Most of these new agents are targeted to haemostatic pathways that have recently {{been shown to be}} of importance in vivo and usually have a higher efficacy than the currently available anticoagulants. The new platelet aggregation inhibitors can be divided into thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban). The new inhibitors of fibrin synthesis can be divided into direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudine, <b>melagatran,</b> ximelagatran), specific factor Xa inhibitors (pentasaccharides: fondaparinux, idraparinux) and inhibitors of the tissue thromboplastin factor VIIa complex (recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c 2, inactivated factor VIIa, recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor).

40|$|New {{insights}} into the in vivo function of the coagulation system {{have resulted in the}} development of new antithrombotic agents with a more specific point of impact and more reliable pharmacological properties.

In some situations, these agents are more effective and safer than the antithrombotics currently used. However, the major difference may be that the newer generation of antithrombotics does not require repeated laboratory control and dose adjustment to obtain a stable level of anticoagulation; therefore, they are more suitable for application in clinical practice.

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE), comprising deep {{vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a multifactorial disease. The aims of the present thesis were to investigate Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G 20210 A mutations as potential risk factors for VTE during and after major surgery, to compare different D-dimer assays and evaluate their usefulness in the diagnosis of DVT, to investigate clinical effects, safety and pharmacokinetic properties of an oral thrombin inhibitor (ximelagatran) when treating VTE and finally to investigate the usefulness of coagulation assays (APTT and PT) during treatment with thrombin inhibition. In a European population (n= 1600) subjected to elective orthopaedic surgery the prothrombin gene G 20210 A mutation {{was found to be}} a risk factor (OR= 9. 2, p< 0. 0002) for symptomatic VTE after elective surgery. The Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be a risk factor only for symptomatic PE (OR= 5. 3, p< 0. 03). During the 8 to 11 -day period with mandatory anticoagulation prophylaxis no significant risk for any of the mutations for objectively verified VTE, mainly consisting of venographic screened DVT, was seen (OR= 1. 25, p= 0. 35). Despite establishing these point mutations as genetic risk factors, approximately 90 % of the carriers will not suffer a symptomatic postoperative VTE when given prophylaxis and therefore general preoperative screening may be of questionable value. In a population of 95 consecutive patients, undergoing venography because of a suspicion of DVT, 40 % of the venographies in our study verified thrombosis. During thrombus formation the simultaneous endogenous fibrinolysis will release fibrin degradation products measurable as plasma D-dimers. The positive predictive values for DVT diagnosis using plasma D-dimer tests are low and insufficient for clinical use when utilising venography verified DVT as the reference. The negative predictive values for the DVT diagnosis was in this study 82 - 100 % at a cut-off of 0. 5 mg/L for conventional ELISAs, rapid membrane and latex tests. Thus, these tests may be one of several useful tools for excluding DVT. In two clinical studies initial treatments of acute DVT (350 patients) and PE (12 patients) with four fixed doses (24 - 60 mg bid) of ximelagatran were evaluated. In the DVT study LMWH/warfarin was used as a comparator. For DVT patients {{there were no significant differences}} between the treatment groups in changes of thrombus sizes, bleeding frequencies, clinical effects, mortalities or treatment discontinuations. In the PE treatment (48 mg bid), 11 of 12 patients showed regressed or unchanged scintigrafic signs of PE. Ximelagatran showed a reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile over the 6 - 9 days of treatment. The maximal plasma <b>melagatran</b> concentrations were obtained 2 - 2. 4 h after intake and the half-life in plasma was 3. 5 - 3. 7 h. The onset of action was rapid, measured as prolongations of APTT, and there was a good correlation (R 2 = 0. 69) between plasma concentrations of <b>melagatran</b> and APTT values. Oral fixed doses were used in the clinical studies without coagulation monitoring. In an in vitro study the effects of <b>melagatran</b> on 17 different prothrombin time assays showed significant differences both in dose-response curves and in effects on INR values. These tests, standardized for treatment with vitamin K antagonists, are not suitable for monitoring the effects of thrombin inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The physiologically most {{important}} activator of intravascular fibrinolysis is {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) released from endothelial cells. In man, sympathomimetic drugs increase the systemic concentration of t-PA. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether cardiac sympathetic activation can induce a local t-PA release, which could counteract intra-coronary clot formation. Thrombolytic therapy with recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) is effective in acute myocardial infarction, but the treatment is limited by a fairly slow reperfusion rate and frequent early reocclusions. A potential mechanism behind early reocclusions might be that active thrombin is released from the thrombus during thrombolytic therapy. Thrombin has recently been shown to activate pro-carboxypeptidase U, which in its active form (CPU) down-regulates endogenous fibrinolysis. Therefore, one way of improving thrombolytic efficacy may be to combine rt-PA with a low-molecular weight direct thrombin inhibitor, which theoretically could have a pro-fibrinolytic effect, either by inhibition of fibrin-bound thrombin and/or by inhibition of CPU activation. An alternative way may be direct inhibition of CPU. In a porcine model, experimental activation of cardiac sympathetic nerves by electrical stimulation at 1 and 8 Hz induced 5 - and 20 -fold increase in the release of both total and active t-PA together with frequency-dependent increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and coronary blood flow. The t PA release was independent of the heart rate and coronary flow response, but local infusion of isoprenaline suggested {{that part of the}} t-PA response was mediated by stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors. Next, we studied the combined effect of rt-PA and thrombin inhibitors (<b>melagatran,</b> hirudin and heparin) in a canine model of copper coil-induced coronary thrombosis. The pro-fibrinolytic effect of rt-PA, either measured as patency rate or time-to-patency, was significantly enhanced with the low-molecular weight direct thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran,</b> but to a lesser degree by hirudin and heparin. In the same model it was shown that active CPU is produced locally in the coronary vascular bed during both thrombus formation and clot lysis. Inhibition of thrombin attenuated CPU formation and improved patency. A similar effect was obtained with a direct inhibitor of CPU. In conclusion, the coronary t-PA response to sympathetic stimulation may constitute a thrombo-protective defence mechanism to counteract its prothrombotic effects on the systemic level. Furthermore, direct thrombin and/or CPU inhibition may be potential targets for prevention of thrombus formation via facilitation of the endogenous fibrinolytic system...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method to immobilize recombinant human tissue factor (rhTF) reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. The rhTF vesicles were immobilized in a multilayer vesicle structure using cholesterol DNA tethers spontaneously {{inserted into the}} lipid membrane. The properties of the rhTF vesicle surface modification were characterized by surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology. As an application of this surface modification, we investigated its use as a blood coagulation activating surface. The coagulation activating capacity of the surface modification was tested by exposure to human whole blood in a flow chamber. No increase in rhTF levels in the blood was found after passage through the flow chamber, indicating that the rhTF surface modification was stable. Thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and prothrombin fragment (PF) 1 + 2 levels increased after exposure to the surface, and decreased in a concentration-dependent way upon addition of <b>melagatran</b> (a direct thrombin inhibitor), i. e., coagulation activity triggered by rhTF could be suppressed by anticoagulation. The results with this new thrombogenic surface are promising, and will be further developed into {{a useful tool for}} coagulation related investigations, e. g., characterization of anticoagulants and biomaterials...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} on {{the function of}} the hemostatic system in vivo and limitations of currently available anticoagulant agents have {{led to the development of}} a new generation of anticoagulants. These new agents have a greater specificity towards activated coagulation pathways and factors and are presently being evaluated in clinical studies. The new generation anticoagulants include specific inhibitors of factor IIa (<b>melagatran),</b> factor Xa (pentasaccharides), and agents that interfere with tissue factor (TF) activity. A limitation of this new class of anticoagulants may be the lack of an appropriate strategy to reverse the effect if a bleeding event occurs. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a potent prohemostatic agent and may represent an interesting option for consideration when an antidote is required. Indeed, rFVIIa has proven to be efficacious in the reversal of anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Studies in healthy subjects have also revealed that rFVIIa administration corrects coagulation time and can induce thrombin generation during anticoagulation with pentasaccharides or TF-inhibiting therapy. These results indicate that rFVIIa infusion results in a prohemostatic response in vivo in patients receiving treatment with factor Xa- or TF-specific anticoagulants. This suggests that rFVIIa may be a good candidate as an antidote for new anticoagulants in cases of (severe) bleeding or in patients scheduled for emergency surger...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{potential}} {{role for}} coagulation factors in {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} has been recently described, but the mechanism of action is currently not known. Here, we investigated the interactions between thrombin and the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in pulmonary endothelial cells and experimental pulmonary hypertension. Principal Findings: Chronic treatment with the selective thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran</b> (0. 9 mg/kg daily via implanted minipumps) reduced right ventricular hypertrophy in the rat monocrotaline model of experimental pulmonary hypertension. In vitro, thrombin {{was found to have}} biphasic effects on key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in endothelial cells (HUVECs). Acute thrombin stimulation led to increased expression of the cGMP-elevating factors endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) subunits, leading to increased cGMP levels. By contrast, prolonged exposition of pulmonary endothelial cells to thrombin revealed a characteristic pattern of differential expression of the key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, in which specifically the factors contributing to cGMP elevation (eNOS and sGC) were reduced and the cGMP-hydrolyzing PDE 5 was elevated (qPCR and Western blot). In line with the differential expression of key regulators of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, a reduction of cGMP by prolonged thrombin stimulation was found. The effects of prolonged thrombin exposure were confirmed in endothelial cells of pulmonary origin (HPAECs and HPMECs). Similar effects could be induced by activation of protease-activated receptor- 1 (PAR- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Bioisosteres {{have been}} defined as {{structurally}} different molecules or substructures that can form comparable intermolecular interactions, and therefore, fragments that bind to similar protein structures exhibit a degree of bioisosterism. We present KRIPO (Key Representation of Interaction in POckets) : a new method for quantifying the similarities of binding site subpockets based on pharmacophore fingerprints. The binding site fingerprints have been optimized to improve their performance for both intra- and interprotein family comparisons. A range of attributes of the fingerprints was considered in the optimization, including the placement of pharmacophore features, {{whether or not the}} fingerprints are fuzzified, and the resolution and complexity of the pharmacophore fingerprints (2 -, 3 -, and 4 -point fingerprints). Fuzzy 3 -point pharmacophore fingerprints were found to represent the optimal balance between computational resource requirements and the identification of potential replacements. The complete PDB was converted into a database comprising almost 300, 000 optimized fingerprints of local binding sites together with their associated ligand fragments. The value of the approach is demonstrated by application to two crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank: (1) a MAP kinase P 38 structure in complex with a pyridinylimidazole inhibitor (1 A 9 U) and (2) a complex of thrombin with <b>melagatran</b> (1 K 22).

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} is {{a serious}} illness that affects patient morbidity and mortality and presents a significant management challenge to healthcare providers world-wide. Despite major achievements in the significant reduction of thromboembolic complications, the most common therapies currently used for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism – heparins and vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin – have several limitations. Warfarin sodium is an effective oral anticoagulant drug. However, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window with significant risks of hemorrhage at therapeutic concentrations. Dosing is difficult and requires frequent monitoring. New oral anticoagulant agents are required to improve current anticoagulant therapy. Furthermore, while warfarin is effective in venous disease, it does not provide more than 60 % risk reduction compared with placebo in venous thrombosis prophylaxis and considerably lower risk reduction in terms of arterial thrombosis.

40|$|Classic {{anticoagulant}} drugs, such as heparin and warfarin, {{are very}} effective. However, although in use {{for more than}} 50 years, they do have some clinical drawbacks. Heparin, now better termed unfractionated heparin, can only be used intravenously and its laboratory control is complicated. Warfarin is orally administered, but its therapeutic window is very narrow and patients need repeated laboratory tests. Moreover, both drugs are non-specific, as they inhibit the coagulation cascade at several steps. Pharmaceutic research has developed new drugs, {{some of which are}} already on the market, such as fondaparinux, a pentasaccharide that can interact with antithrombin, thus inhibiting factor Xa. This pentasaccharide is part of the parent heparin molecule and can be chemically synthesized, with the advantage of avoiding extractive compounds. Fondaparinux has a half-life compatible with once-a-day administration; modification of its structure (idraparinux) has led to more stable binding with antithrombin and to an increase in its half-life to allow once-a-week administration. Alternatives to oral anticoagulants have been developed following the study of some compounds like hirudin, which directly binds thrombin and blocks its catalytic site. One of these molecules, ximelagatran, is in advanced clinical development. Ximelagatran is converted into its active form, <b>melagatran,</b> in the circulation, and thrombin activity can be blocked by oral administration twice daily. There is no need for laboratory control and phase II and phase III studies are encouraging. The next few years should bring great changes to the treatment of patients with thromboembolic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Clinical islet {{transplantation}} is {{an emerging}} procedure to cure type 1 diabetes. The graft is implanted by infusion into the liver through the portal vein. A major obstacle that {{still needs to}} be overcome is the requirement for islets from multiple donors to achieve insulin independence. An innate inflammatory reaction, the IBMIR, is elicited when islets are exposed to blood. The IBMIR {{has been described as a}} clotting reaction culminating in disruption of islet morphology and is a plausible cause for loss of tissue during the early post-transplant period. In this thesis, the underlying mechanisms of the IBMIR were characterized. The IBMIR was for the first time demonstrated in patients undergoing an islet transplant, and a number of clinically applicable strategies to limit this reaction were identified. The thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran</b> completely blocked the IBMIR in an in vitro tubing blood loop system, indicating that thrombin is the driving force in the reaction. Interestingly, islets were shown to produce and secrete tissue factor (TF), the physiological trigger of coagulation. Inactivated FVIIa, a specific inhibitor of TF, successfully blocked initiation of the IBMIR. An alternative approach to limit the IBMIR was to pre-treat islets in culture prior to transplantation. Nicotinamide added to the culture medium effectively decreased the level of TF in human islets. Infiltration of immune cells, also a part of the IBMIR, was characterized in detail. The predominant cell types infiltrating the islets were neutrophilic granulocytes and, to a lesser degree, monocytes. Both cell types may exert direct cytotoxic effects, and the antigen-presenting monocytes may also be important for directing the specific immune system to the site of inflammation. These findings have provided new insight into the nature of the IBMIR and offer several new strategies to improve the outcome of clinical islet transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor ximelagatran, and its active form, <b>melagatran,</b> {{have been}} tested in various clinical conditions as a promising alternative to conventional anticoagulant therapy (CAT), despite some concerns over potentially serious liver injury. Objectives: To assess its risk/benefit profile, a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing xi-/melagatran to CAT was performed. Methods: Leading medical databases were searched. The rates of major adverse events (MAE: all cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal thromboembolic stroke, nonfatal pulmonary embolism), major bleeds (MB), and hepatotoxicity were compared. Out of 140 potentially relevant citations, 13 RCTs enrolling 22, 639 patients were included. Indications for treatment were: 1) perioperative prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT); 2) management of DVT; and 3) stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Results: Overall, the risk of MAE (OR 0. 98 [0. 83 - 1. 17]) and MB (OR 1. 01 [0. 69 - 1. 47]) {{did not differ significantly}} between xi-/melagatran and CAT. There was a clear trend towards an increased risk of hepatotoxicity (OR 1. 74 [0. 50 - 6. 01]), with an incidence of 5. 8 % with xi-/melagatran versus 2. 3 % with CAT (p < 0. 001); more specifically, the rate of hepatotoxicity was markedly augmented in the management of DVT (OR 5. 16 [3. 38 - 7. 89]), for treatment durations ≥ 3 months (OR 6. 73 [5. 01 - 9. 05]), and in the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke (OR 8. 31 [5. 65 - 12. 23]). Two fatal cases of liver injury occurred with xi-/melagatran. Conclusions: Although comparable to CAT in terms of MAE and MB, xi-/melagatran carries a prohibitive risk of hepatotoxicity that cannot be ignored.

40|$|Biliary {{excretion}} is {{an important}} elimination route for many drugs and metabolites. For such compounds, {{it is important to}} know the extent of excretion and drug exposure in the bile, e. g., for the risk assessment of drug interactions, liver toxicity and the effects of genetic variants. In this thesis, duodenal aspiration of bile was performed in healthy volunteers and complemented with experiments in an in vivo model in pigs to increase the understanding of the intestinal and hepatobiliary disposition of two direct thrombin inhibitors. The compounds investigated, ximelagatran and AZD 0837, are both prodrugs that require bioactivation to exert their pharmacological effect. Upon co-administration with erythromycin and ketoconazole, respectively, altered plasma exposure to ximelagatran and AZD 0837 and their respective metabolites has been observed. The main objective of this thesis was to characterize the biliary excretion of the compounds, and investigate whether this elimination route explains the observed drug-drug interactions. High plasma-to-bile AUC ratios were observed, in particular for ximelagatran, its active metabolite <b>melagatran,</b> and AR-H 067637, the active metabolite of AZD 0837. These high ratios indicate the involvement of active transporters in the biliary excretion of the compounds, which is important since transporters constitute possible sites for drug interactions. The effects of erythromycin and ketoconazole on the plasma exposure of the prodrugs and metabolites were confirmed in both the pig and the clinical studies. The changes seen in plasma for ximelagatran and its metabolites were partly explained by reduced biliary clearance. Inhibited CYP 3 A 4 metabolism likely caused the elevated plasma levels of AZD 0837, whereas reduced biliary clearance was seen for AR-H 067637 suggesting an effect on its excretion into bile. In summary, the studies led to mechanistic insights in the hepatobiliary disposition of ximelagatran and AZD 0837, and demonstrate the value of combined clinical and animal studies for the investigation of the biliary drug excretion...|$|E

40|$|We {{appreciate}} the remarks made by Bernstein et al and by Marlu et al. In our study, a single {{dose of the}} prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) Cofact normalized the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban, but not that of dabigatran, measured by means of coagulation assays in healthy subjects. 1 We agree with the comment by Marlu et al that these tests may insufficiently represent a definitive beneficial effect in patients with hemorrhage. To establish PCCs as effective reversing agents for the new oral anticoagulants, clinical data are required, as indicated in the Discussion of our article. However, {{in the absence of}} such data for any agent that may reverse the anticoagulant effect of the new agents, an increase in thrombin generation, as observed in our study, may be considered the best available surrogate outcome parameter. We agree with Bernstein et al that various PCCs may have different properties and that results in our study with Cofact can be translated to alternative PCCs only to a limited extent. Those different properties may explain why our findings contradict some of the animal studies designed for the same purpose in examples mentioned by both Bernstein et al and Marlu et al. Activated PCCs such as Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypass Agent may therefore be more potent hemostatic agents and could be capable of reversing the anticoagulant effect of direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran. However, this has not yet been established in humans. Previous studies with activated factor VII as a potent prohemostatic agent showed a lack of thrombin generation in subjects treated with the thrombin inhibitor <b>melagatran.</b> 2 In the absence of clinical trial data, we would applaud a registry as proposed by Bernstein et al to record clinical experience with reversal of the anticoagulant effect of all new oral anticoagulants.
