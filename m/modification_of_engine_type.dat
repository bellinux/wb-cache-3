50|$|Missiles are {{powered by}} an engine, {{generally}} either a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> rocket <b>engine</b> or jet engine. Rockets are generally {{of the solid}} fuel type for ease of maintenance and fast deployment, although some larger ballistic missiles use Liquid-propellant rockets. Jet engines are generally used in cruise missiles, most commonly of the turbojet type, due to its relative simplicity and low frontal area. Turbofans and ramjets are the only other common forms <b>of</b> jet <b>engine</b> propulsion, although any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> could theoretically be used. Missiles often have multiple engine stages, particularly in those launched from the surface. These stages may all be of similar types or may include a mix <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> − for example, surface-launched cruise missiles often have a rocket booster for launching and a jet engine for sustained flight.|$|R
