However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type.

The matter was first raised in Parliament in November 1939, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene.

5|$|During Rogue Squadron development, {{the first}} new Star Wars film in more than 15yearswas {{less than one year}} from its {{scheduled}} release date. To take advantage of this marketing opportunity, Factor 5 included content from the upcoming film in Rogue Squadron. LucasFilm provided the developers with design art for the Naboo Starfighter, a ship prominently featured in the new film. These designs were used to create an in-game model. Because the game was scheduled to be released six months before the film, Factor 5 was required to keep the ship's inclusion a secret. As a result, most of the game's development team at Factor 5 and LucasArts were not informed of its inclusion. A complex scrambling system was also developed to help hide the ship's code from gamers using cheat cartridges such as GameShark or Action Replay. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> after the release of Rogue Squadron, LucasArts unveiled the code to unlock the Naboo Starfighter as a playable craft.

30|$|Hepatic injury causes {{occurrence}} of SHPCs in retrorsine-treated liver, and they gradually restore {{the loss of}} hepatocytes or replace the injured hepatocytes (Serra et al. 2012 Gordon et al. 2000 a, bVig et al. 2006). Although SHPCs have some of phenotype makers in common with oval cells or mature hepatocytes (Gordon et al. 2000 a, b), the most intrinsic features of SHPCs are their small size, albumin production and formation of nodules. SHPCs also lack in expression of some CYP isozymes at immature stage. Because retrorsine is metabolized into active forms in hepatic microsomes and then selectively damages hepatocytes, the lack of CYP expression might be the mechanism of retrorsine resistance of SHPCs (Gordon et al. 2000 b). The origin of SHPCs is largely endogenous cell population of the liver and contribution of bone marrow cells is considered less likely (Vig et al. 2006). In the current study using LT model, however, we identified the clusters of GFP positive small cells fulfilling these characteristic features of SHPCs for the first time. Also, GFP positive SHPCs-like cells at eight weeks showed high rate of Ki 67 positive cells and several size of nucleus, suggesting their ability of proliferation and maturation. Besides, the retrorsine pretreated liver showed clusters of GFP positive hepatocytes at least <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> after transplantation, suggesting long-term survival in the transplanted liver (data not shown). However, the biological importance of GFP positive SHPCs-like cells is unclear due to the very low rate of occurrence, and a further study is necessary.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Some inter-proximal {{areas of}} teeth are not {{available}} to brushing thus dental flossing for eliminating plaque is needed. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the determining factors based on trans-theoretical model (TTM) among high school students. Methods: This descriptive, analytical, cross- sectional study was conducted during April and May 2012. 653 high schools students of Pakdasht in Iran were selected through multi-stages cluster-sampling method and participated in this study. A Researcher-designed questionnaire, including demographic information, stage of change, self efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers parts for collecting data was used. Data were collected based on TTM framework. Content validity of the questionnaire was determined using Lawsche's formula and CVI= 0. 97 and its reliability was specified through Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0. 83). Data were then analyzed by SPSS software V 15. Logistic Regression, spearman Correlation, ANOVA and nonparametric tests were used as the statistical methods. Results:The majority of students 73 % (n= 477) in dental flossing were in pre-contemplation and contemplation stages of change. Self efficacy and perceived benefits scores were lower in primary stage of change and perceived barriers were higher at the primary stage (p< 0. 000). Moreover, it was found that increase in perceived self efficacy enhances chance of dental flossing and maintaining this behavior <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>month,</b> and increase in perceived barriers of people declines this chance (p< 0. 000). Conclusion:The findings showed a high percentage of students were in pre-contemplation and contemplation stages in dental flossing behaviorthus probably will expose with inter-dental decays in the future. Self efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers are determinant factors of dental flossing which should be considered in educational programs.
