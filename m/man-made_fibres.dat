40|$|The {{production}} {{of textile materials}} has undergone {{dramatic changes in the}} last century. <b>Man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> have played an important role for more than 70 years. Today, the <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibre</b> industry is the worldwide second largest biorefinery (next to the paper industry). In the last few years, the interest in <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> has grown as a consequence of increased environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, an environmental assessment of modern <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> has not been conducted so far. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the environmental impact of <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres.</b> Five staple fibre products, i. e., 1) Lenzing Viscose Asia, 2) Lenzing Viscose Austria, 3) Lenzing Modal, 4) Tencel Austria, and 5) Tencel Austria 2012, are analysed by means of Life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary is cradle to factory gate. We compare the results with conventional cotton, novel bio-based fibres (PLA fibres), and fossil fuel-based fibres (PET and PP). The inventory data for the {{production of}} <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> were provided by Lenzing AG. The inventory data for cotton, PET, PP, and PLA were obtained from literature sources. The environmental indicators analysed include resources and the impact categories covered by CML 2000 baseline method. The indicators for resources include non-renewable energy use (NREU), renewable energy use (REU), cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, and land use. The environmental impact indicators covered by the CML method are global warming potential (GWP) 100 a, abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. In addition, the system boundary of cradle to factory gate plus end-of-life waste management was analysed for NREU and GWP. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been carried out to understand the influence of various assumptions and allocation methods. The LCA results show that Lenzing Viscose Austria and Lenzing Modal offer environmental benefits in all categories (except for land use and water use) compared to Lenzing Viscose Asia. Tencel Austria 2012, Lenzing Viscose Austria, Lenzing Modal, and Tencel Austria are the most favourable choices from an environmental point of view among all the fibres studied. These four <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> offer important benefits for reducing NREU, GWP, toxicity impacts, water use, and land use. Lenzing Viscose Asia has higher impacts than the other <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> with regard to NREU, GWP, abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, and acidification. Cotton is identified as the least preferred choice due to its high ecotoxicity impacts, eutrophication, water use, land use, and relatively low land use efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Man-made</b> {{cellulose}} <b>fibres</b> {{have played}} an important role in the production of textile products for more than 70 years. The purpose of this study is to assess the environmental impact of <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres.</b> Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for three types of fibres (i. e. Viscose, Modal and Tencel) produced by Lenzing AG. The functional unit is one tonne of staple fibre. The system boundary is cradle to factory gate. We compared the LCA results with other commodity fibres, namely cotton, PET and PP. Primary energy demand, water use, land use and the CML baseline impact categories were assessed. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to understand the influence of different allocation methods. In addition, three single score methods were introduced and applied. The LCA results show that four modern <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibre</b> products, namely Tencel, Modal, Viscose (Austria) and Tencel (2012), have the lowest overall impact among all fibres studied. Viscose (Asia) has a higher overall impact than the other <b>man-made</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> and is comparable to PET. Cotton is identified as the least preferred choice due to its high ecotoxicity impacts, eutrophication, water use and land use. The LCA results are influenced by the allocation methods applied; however, the ranking of all fibres does not chang...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of fibres used: natural <b>fibre</b> and <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> (synthetics or petroleum based).Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain weave.

2500|$|Wishing {{to reduce}} their {{dependence}} on natural silk, [...] in 1904, Courtaulds acquired the Cross and Bevan patents to the viscose process for manufacturing artificial silk or rayon from dissolving pulp. [...] They set up the first factory to produce it in Coventry UK in 1905. [...] The early yarns were first woven into fabrics at the Halstead Mill in Essex in March 1906, but the process remained troublesome until further inventions improved yarn strength. [...] However, {{in a few years}} the process became highly successful and was responsible for transforming the silk weaver into the world's leading <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> production company.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{prices were}} stable, {{the company had}} a {{potential}} revenue generator in Tencel, a <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> Courtaulds had spent £100 million and 10 years bringing to market.

While rayon production generates large amounts of sulfurous waste, Tencel is made with a [...] "closed loop" [...] chemical {{process in which the}} solvent can be filtered and reused. The final product is far stronger than rayon or cotton, which allows a huge variety of different forms and feels - from ultrasoft yet strong denim jeans, to shirts that feel like silk, to scarves that ape the texture of cashmere.|$|R
