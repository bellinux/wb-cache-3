5000|$|Currently {{there are}} nine deaneries which are united into a Metropolis headed by Metropolitan Jonah Lwanga. The {{headquarters}} is in Namungoona, a neighborhood of the capital Kampala. The clergy consists of 48 priests and 7 deacons. It has 80 communities, {{some of which have}} no priests and are run by catechists. There are 41 brick and mortar churches, 17 medical clinics, and the Holy Cross Mission Hospital. Approximately 30,000 Ugandans claim Orthodox baptism, but far fewer actually attend services. Many parishes have boarding schools. Tuition, accommodation and <b>meals</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by parents or sponsors from outside Uganda. Most of the teachers are not Orthodox. Orthodox students who have been sponsored through the Church, usually leave to teach at non-Orthodox schools. The most developed parish is St. Antonios, Monde, near Wobulenzi. Father Antonios Mutyaba is the priest of that parish. At Monde there are a primary and secondary school, a hospital, a church of Saint Anthony the Great, and the first monastery in Uganda with one nun. Sister Maria {{is one of the first}} four young women who expressed a interest in monasticism in Uganda. There had been two nuns, but one left to start her own monastery. There is an on-and-off catechetical school which is mistakenly called a seminary. Few if any classes are held, and the [...] "seminarians" [...] spend their time in idleness and searching for something to eat. The most pressing problem for the church is the corruption of the priests. In 2014, the communities in Gulu and Lira removed themselves from the authority of Metropolitan Jonah and petitioned the Patriarch of Alexandria to give them their own bishop. The Patriarch has not taken any action, leaving the northern parishes in a state of canonical schism.|$|E

50|$|A Pending <b>Meal</b> <b>is</b> one <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> at a {{restaurant}} or other food joint, to {{be made available to}} any future visitor who asks for it. The Pending <b>Meal</b> community initiative <b>was</b> started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah, U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan.|$|R

These include Karma Kitchen, where patrons' <b>meals</b> have already <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by previous customers, and customers are then encouraged to contribute toward future patrons' meals.

40|$|Based on a {{modified}} Becker household consumption and production model and newly surveyed data set {{collected by the}} authors, this study investigated household expenditure on food away from home (FAFH) and its determinants in Beijing, China. A Box-Cox double-hurdle regression is estimated. The key findings suggest that household expenditure on dining but might be significantly underestimated when using the data most commonly used in food consumption research in China. Excluding hosted <b>meals</b> that <b>are</b> not <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by individual consumers comprises nearly {{one half of the}} underestimation. Meanwhile, this exclusion could bias estimates of income effects on the demand for food away from home. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|More {{detailed}} purpose codes {{would significantly}} improve tracking all external financing sources in global health. Additionally, better classification of expenditures would help elucidate exactly how charitable organizations are utilizing their funds, promoting transparency and accountability. It {{became clear that}} there is an overall lack of standardized measurement metrics, and in some cases, a complete lack of reporting on what defined a program service expense. Organizations adhering to the short-term mission model best illustrate this point. In this model, surgical teams from high resource settings come to a LMIC for short period of time, often with their own supplies and equipment, and perform a very specific surgery on a group of patients in a defined period of time. While their own time is often voluntary, the cost of their travel (airfare, accommodations, and <b>meals)</b> <b>is</b> often <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by the organization. If these indirect costs are being counted as, for example, a service expense or administrative expense, it will not be clear from the financial data that these expenses were actually relating to a short-term mission, making it challenging to track funding flows to all elements of charitable surgical care. Consequently, this makes it difficult to fully analyze the allocation of resources and make corresponding recommendations for their most efficient use.|$|R

In 2009 The New Yorker said: Michelin has gone to extraordinary lengths to maintain the anonymity of its inspectors. Many of the company's top executives have never met an inspector; inspectors themselves are advised not to disclose their line of work, even to their parents (who {{might be tempted to}} boast about it); and, in all the years that it has been putting out the guide, Michelin has refused to allow its inspectors to speak to journalists. The inspectors write reports that are distilled, in annual [...] "stars meetings" [...] at the guide's various national offices, into the ranking of three stars, two stars, or one star—or no stars. (Establishments that Michelin deems unworthy of a visit are not included in the guide.) ...|$|R

According to the reporter, when questioned as to why she would reimburse the restaurant for a <b>meal</b> that had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by MZM, Harris abruptly terminated the interview, and her spokesman later called and requested unsuccessfully that the story not be printed. The next day, Harris's campaign issued a statement that she had believed her campaign had reimbursed the restaurant, and that she had donated $100 [...] "which will more than adequately compensate for the cost of my beverage and appetizer". Harris also asserted that most {{of the cost of the}} <b>meal</b> <b>was</b> from Wade ordering several unopened bottles of wine to take home, although the management of the restaurant denies ever allowing anyone to take unopened bottles of wine off the premises, saying [...] "Why would we jeopardize our liquor license for the sake of selling a couple bottles of wine?" ...|$|R
