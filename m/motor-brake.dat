60|$|A shell-pink <b>motor-brake</b> roared {{up behind}} {{us to the}} music on a key-bugle of 'The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat.' In a few minutes we overtook another, in natural wood, whose {{occupants}} were singing it through their noses.|$|E
60|$|A <b>motor-brake</b> {{had pulled}} {{up at the}} door and a {{multitude}} of men and women immediately descended. We went out to look. They bore rolled banners, a reading-desk in three pieces, and, I specially noticed, a collapsible harmonium, such as is used on ships at sea.|$|E
40|$|The Common Drive Unit (CDU) {{is a high}} {{reliability}} rotary actuator with many versatile applications in mechanism designs. The CDU incorporates a set of redundant <b>motor-brake</b> assemblies driving a single output shaft through differential. Tachometers provide speed information in the AC version. Operation of both motors, {{as compared to the}} operation of one motor, will yield the same output torque with twice the output speed...|$|E
60|$|Sir Timothy walked {{that evening}} amongst the shadows. Two hours ago, {{the last of}} the workmen from the great {{furnishing}} and catering establishments who undertook the management of his famous entertainments, had ceased work for the day and driven off in the <b>motor-brakes</b> hired to take them to the nearest town. The long, low wing whose use no one was able absolutely to divine, was still full of animation, but the great reception-rooms and stately hall were silent and empty. In the gymnasium, an enormous apartment as large as an ordinary concert hall, two or three electricians were still at work, directed by the man who had accompanied Sir Timothy to the East End on the night before. The former crossed the room, his footsteps awaking strange echoes.|$|R
