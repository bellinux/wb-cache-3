500|$|StarClan is a {{group of}} the Clans' {{deceased}} ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured).StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the <b>Moonpool,</b> a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can [...] "just get glimpses of" [...] the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they will fade away-it is unknown what happens to them after this.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to obtain a 2 D {{floating}} breakwater model with high performance in wave reflection, genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with boundary element method (BEM) in the previous study. The performance of the obtained model was verified with numerical relations {{as well as an}} experiment in towing tank. Moreover, its performance and characteristics in 3 D case were also evaluated in the subsequent study. However, because the 3 D model is formed by simply extruding the 2 D shape in longitudinal direction, it only produces a model with uniform transversal shape which is considered to be less effective and efficient in terms of technical and economical points of view. Consequently, it is needed to modify the model to obtain a more realistic and efficient design without reducing significantly the high performance obtained previously. In the present study, several modifications of the original 3 D model are performed which include placing <b>moonpools</b> inside the body. The performance and characteristics of the modified models in terms of wave elevations on the free surface are evaluated at various wavelengths by using higher order boundary element method (HOBEM). The accuracy of the computed results is confirmed with Haskind-Newman and energy conservation relations. From the modifications and evaluations of the models, it could be realized that the <b>moonpools</b> inside the body could be used to obtain a more realistic model without reducing the optimum performance of the original model shape...|$|R

40|$|On {{construction}} vessels subsea modules, diving bells, {{cables and}} so on are often lifted through a <b>moonpool.</b> The advantage of using a <b>moonpool</b> is that the surface elevation inside the <b>moonpool</b> is shielded against the outside waves. Further, the <b>moonpool</b> is often located close to the vessels center of rotation, which makes the lifting operation less sensitive to vertical motions due to roll and pitch. For some frequencies the water inside the <b>moonpool</b> may be excited in a resonant condition such as sloshing or so-called piston mode. In these cases the benefit of using a <b>moonpool</b> may be outweighed by the large resonant excitation. This thesis compares the hydrodynamic properties between a regular sized <b>moonpool</b> and a <b>moonpool</b> that is significantly larger. First, the results from a model test campaign for a specific offshore operation have been analyzed. The campaign was performed in irregular waves with a construction vessel moored in a stationary position with modules inside the <b>moonpool.</b> The results are indicating that modules are shielded from the incident waves, especially for the high frequent waves where the response is almost cancelled. There are some indications for a resonant piston mode occurring, but with a very low amplification. The largest amplifications are close to 1. Meaning that the wave height inside the <b>moonpool</b> {{is similar to the}} wave height of the incident wave. Finally, the vessel has been modeled and analyzed numerically using the potential theory based panel method. The software WAMIT has been used to calculate responses due to radiation and diffraction. The surface elevation indicates that the piston mode is very large for the standard size <b>moonpool</b> compared to the enlarged <b>moonpool.</b> However, when the <b>moonpool</b> is enlarged, a sloshing mode becomes more dominant. Comparing the experimental and the numerical method has proven to be challenging. The model test was performed for a very complex system with a lot of details that are hard to replicate; both from a modeling point of view and with regards to all the physical effects that should be accounted for. </p...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{scope of}} this Master Thesis was to assess {{critical}} factors when running and retrieving Framo pump modules through the <b>moonpool</b> of a vessel. The thesis has been presented in a twofold manner. The first part thoroughly describes Framo Engineering AS equipment. Internal procedures and discussions with Framo employees {{have been used to}} obtain needed information. The second part has been dedicated to <b>moonpool</b> theory. Emphasize has been made on describing the behavior of the water inside the <b>moonpool.</b> The Bernoulli equation was used to prove that <b>moonpool</b> water motions have similar response characteristics as those of a mass-spring system. At the <b>moonpool</b> bottom opening the water motions are hard to describe. <b>Moonpool</b> responses have been described based on formulas given in DNV-RP-H 103. Possible natural periods has been presented for a standard <b>moonpool,</b> showing that resonance condition may arise during a North Sea operation. Large water oscillations are the main concern during a <b>moonpool</b> operation. Hydrodynamic parameters have been discussed, including added mass and damping. Values for added mass and drag coefficients for Framo pump and running tool have been estimated according to DNV-RP-H 103. From this thesis it can be concluded that installation through the <b>moonpool</b> has both advantages and disadvantages compared to the overside crane operations. To be able to predict the forces in the <b>moonpool</b> adequate input data such as transfer functions and hydrodynamic parameters should be obtained from dedicated software. Due to the complex geometry of Framo equipment, estimates of hydrodynamic coefficients should come from models test or CFD-analysis...|$|E
