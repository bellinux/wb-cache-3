5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} <b>motion</b> <b>and</b> {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On <b>Motion)</b> <b>and</b> his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of <b>motion)</b> <b>and</b> by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} copying rate of tool motions to {{workpiece}} profiles. A machining system is developed to measure tool <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> workpiece profiles during machining processes. Tool motions are {{measured with a}} laser displacement sensor and an artifact. Workpiece profiles are measured by scanning type on-machine measurement. Sinusoidal profiles with various amplitudes are machined with a diamond tool to compare tool <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> workpiece profiles. The experimental result shows that the commanded <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> vibrations are copied on workpiece profiles. The ratios between the amplitudes of <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> profiles are calculated in the frequency domain to identify the copying rate. It is verified that the commanded motions are almost perfectly copied under the amplitudes of from 0. 5 μm to 4 μm and the developed system is {{able to identify the}} copying rate under the amplitudes of from 0. 5 μm to 1 μm...|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, <b>motion,</b> <b>and</b> position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) <b>motion,</b> <b>and</b> deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a <b>motion,</b> <b>and</b> that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary <b>motion,</b> <b>and</b> determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to {{have a profound effect on}} the geologies of the three moons.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of <b>motion</b> <b>and</b> is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel manipulation trajectory generating algorithm that constructs trajectories from learned <b>motion</b> harmonics <b>and</b> user defined constraints. The algorithm uses functional eigenanalysis to learn motion harmonics from demonstrated <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> {{then use the}} motion harmonics to compute the optimal trajectory that resembles the demonstrated <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> also satisfies the constraints. The algorithm has been tested on five real human motion data sets to obtain <b>motion</b> harmonics <b>and</b> then generate <b>motions</b> of each task for a NAO robot. The generated trajectories were compared with the trajectories generated using linear segment with parabolic blend approach and with the Open Motion Planning Library. The approach can also work with motion planners...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we show that}} the concept of a one-parameter {{persistent}} rigid-body motion is a slight generalisation of a class of motions called Ribaucour motions by Study. This allows a simple description of these motions in terms of their axode surfaces. We then investigate other special rigid-body <b>motions,</b> <b>and</b> ask if these can be persistent. The special motions studied are line-symmetric <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> <b>motions</b> generated by the moving frame adapted to a smooth curve. We are able to find geometric conditions for the special motions to be persistent and, in most cases, we can describe the axode surfaces in some detail. In particular, this work reveals some subtle connections between persistent rigid-body <b>motions</b> <b>and</b> the classical differential geometry of curves and ruled surfaces...|$|R
5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of <b>motion</b> <b>and</b> astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
