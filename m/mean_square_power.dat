In this paper, tool wear is characterized by remaining useful tool life in a turning operation and is predicted using spindle power and a random sample path method of Bayesian inference. Turning tests are performed at different speeds and feed rates using a carbide tool and MS 309 steel work material. The spindle power and the tool flank wear are monitored during cutting; the root mean square of the time domain power is found to be sensitive to tool wear. Sample root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>power</b> growth curves are generated and the probability of each curve being the true growth curve is updated using Bayes’ rule.

The two aileron-controlled rotor configurations used 20 and 38 percent chord ailerons, while the tip-controlled rotor had a pitchable blade tip. The ability of the control surfaces to regulate power was determined by measuring the change in power caused by an incremental change in the deflection angle of the control surface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the robust design optimization of an RF-MEMS direct contact cantilever switch for minimum actuation voltage and opening time, and maximum power handling capability. The design variables are {{the length and}} thickness of the entire cantilever, the widths of the sections of the cantilever, and the dimple size. The actuation voltage is obtained using a 3 -D structural-electrostatic finite-element method (FEM) model, and the opening time is obtained using the same FEM model and the experimental model of adhesion at the contact surfaces developed in our previous work. The model accounts for an unpredictable variance in the contact resistance resulting from the micromachining process for the estimation of the power handling. This is achieved by taking {{the ratio of the}} root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>power</b> of the RF current (signal") passing through the switch to the contact temperature ("noise") resulting from the possible range of the contact resistance. The resulting robust optimization problem is solved using a Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, to obtain design alternatives exhibiting different tradeoffs among the three objectives. The results show that there exists substantial room for improved designs of RF-MEMS direct-contact switches. It also provides {{a better understanding of the}} key factors contributing to the performances of RF-MEMS switches.

40|$|Modern sonar systems employ {{sophisticated}} {{signal processing}} methods. In order to verify system performance, {{data of the}} type expected in actual system operation is required. However, because of the prohibitively high cost of sea experiments, simulated data is often used. New methods of simulating nonstationary, Gaussian, multibeam sonar reverberation sequences are presented. A continuous, first-order scattering model is used to relate sonar, environmental and geometrical factors to the reverberation power spectral density at a set of ranges. Then stationary, multibeam, correlated realizations of the reverberation are generated for each range by one of two methods. The two methods are called the Cholesky factor method and the autoregressive spectral factorization method. Primary {{emphasis is placed on}} the autoregressive method. The Cholesky factor method involves factoring the power spectrum matrix at each of a set of frequencies spanning the sonar bandwidth. The resultant Cholesky factors are then used together with a random number generator to synthesize frequency domain realizations. Finally the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to recover the time domain realizations from the frequency domain realizations. The autoregressive method is {{based on the fact that}} autoregressive models provide an approximate canonical factorization of the reverberation power spectrum. Regardless of the method used the next step is to window, overlap and add the stationary sequences from different ranges together. This yields a time series with time varying spectrum as is appropriate for reverberation. The final step is to apply a range(time) varying scaling to adjust the time varying <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>power</b> of the time series...|$|E

Thus, {{the main}} {{objective of this}} study is to make a temporal and frequency analysis of the acceleration in front crawl swimming, regarding the gender and the performance. The sample was composed by 31 male swimmers (15 of high-level and 16 of low-level) and 20 female swimmers (11 of high-level and 9 of low-level). The acceleration was registered from the third complete cycle during eight seconds in a 25 meters maximum velocity test. A position transducer (200 Hz) was used to collect the data, and it was synchronized to an aquatic camera (25 Hz). The acceleration in the temporal (root mean square, minimum and maximum of the acceleration) and frequency (power peak, power peak frequency and spectral area) domains was calculated with Fourier analysis, as well as the velocity and the spectrums distribution in function to present one or more main peaks (type 1 and type 2). A one-way ANOVA was used to establish differences between gender and performance. Results show differences between genders in all the temporal domain variables (p< 0. 05) and only the Spectral Area (SA) in the frequency domain (p< 0. 05). Between gender and performance, only the Root Mean Square (RMS) showed differences in the performance of the male swimmers (p< 0. 05) and in the higher level swimmers, the Maximum (Max) and the Power Peak (PP) of the acceleration showed differences between both genders (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] casing pressure {{data from a}} transonic rotor and rotor-stator stage measured using high-speed pressure probes embedded in the casewall over the rotor tips are analyzed. Using long data sets sampled at a high frequency, low-frequency (less than onceper- revolution) nonaxisymmetric flow phenomena were detected while operating at steady-state conditions near stall. Both the rotor and stage cases are investigated, and the difference in behavior of a rotor with and without a stator blade row is investigated. Data for both cases over the speed range 70 – 100 % of design and from choke to near the stability limit (stall or surge) are presented. The root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>power</b> of the lowfrequency signal {{as well as its}} fraction of the total pressure signal is presented. It was thought that the behavior of these signals as stall was approached could lead to some method of detecting the proximity of stall. For the rotor-only configuration, the strength of these nonaxisymmetric phenomena increased as stall was approached for all speedlines. However, for the stage configuration, more representative of an operational machine, these were of a lower magnitude and did not exhibit a clearly increasing trend as stall was approached. This would seem to indicate that the stator suppressed these signals somewhat. It is also shown that these nonaxisymmetric phenomena led to a significant variation of the mean relative inlet flow angle into the rotor blade. During stable operation near to stall at 100 % speed for the rotor-only case, a 1. 9 deg variation of this angle was measured. This compared with a 5. 6 deg variation over the entire speed-line. Further, it was observed that while the rotor and stage cases had different stability limits, their peak relative inlet flow angles near stall were similar for both along most speed-lines.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to detect and quantify low-velocity impact damage in structures made from composite materials. This research represents a study using simplified coupon specimens. The composite material chosen for the current research is a woven Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) prepreg with a MTM 57 resin system (42 %RW) with CF 2900 fabric (280 g/m 2, 12 K and 2 x 2 twill fabric). This woven material was fabricated to produce coupon size specimens of 250 mm x 150 mm with II, 12 and 13 layers of thickness. Piezoelectric sensors of type SONOX® P 5 were placed on three different locations on each of the coupon size specimens to record the responses along different directions of the ply and at different distances from the impact events. Two different approaches were used to record the acceleration response signals resulting from the impact excitation. The first approach used the LMS Testlab Impact Modal Analysis environment in order to acquire time data and produce spectra for a number of non-damaging impacts from a standard instrumented impulse hammer. The second approach used an instrumented drop-test rig to perform the potentially damaging impacts. The impact energies for this approach were set to range from 0. 37 J to 41. 72 J. The response signals from each test specimen were recorded using the LMS SCADAS III data acquisition system and saved for evaluation. To gather the appropriate information to make inferences regarding the extent of the damage, two different methods were used to estimate the damaged area. The first method measured the damage size using a vernier caliper directly on the impacted surface. The second method used developed X-ray films. For the latter method, the damage area was estimated as the rectangular area bounded by the width and length of the largest flaws visible parallel to the two plate axes. The correlation between the damage area in terms of the impact energy and force detected is presented and discussed. In this research, following a systematic series of experiments on the induction of impact damage in composite specimens, Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to inspect the topographies of the impacted surface at high magnifications. Two different approaches were used here to observe the type of failure modes. The first observation was on the surface defects of the impacted samples whilst the second type, usually categorised as destructive testing, visualised the cross-sectional defects to look at the internal damages. A damage model and damage pattern was developed from this work, which can provide sufficient information on the type and extent of damage. Both the damage model and pattern can be used to provide fundamental understanding of damage and failure mode progression in carbon fibre reinforced compo~ites with varying layer numbers and impact energies. Wavelet analysis is a well-known and powerful approach to feature extraction for problems in condition monitoring and damage detection. In this research, it is applied in the context of impact damage detection and quantification. The approach was based on response time signals recorded from the piezoelectric sensors. Damage indices in terms of Root <b>Mean</b> <b>Square,</b> <b>Power</b> Spectrum Density and Envelope Mean were presented. The results show that all three potential damage indices show a monotonic increase with impact energy and this behaviour is important when damage needs to be detected directly from the impact data. The current research was based on the idea of implementing machine-learning methods to identify and categorise (damaging and non-damaging) impacts using structural response data. To implement this idea, a novelty detection method using outlier analysis was used. This method {{has proved to be a}} successful in separating the damaged and non-damage features and classifying the types of failure modes. This method was considered an excellent approach to identify and categorise the impact events using structural response data. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Many cortical and subcortical areas that also exhibit theta oscillations {{have been linked to}} functional circuits with the hippocampus on the basis of coupled activities at theta frequencies. We examine, in freely moving rats, the characteristics of diencephalic theta local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the supramammillary/mammillary (SuM/MM) areas that are bi-directionally connected to the HPC through the septal complex. Using partial directed coherence (PDC), we find support for previous suggestions that SuM modulates HPC theta at higher frequencies. We find weak separation of SuM and MM by dominant theta frequency recorded locally. Contrary to oscillatory cell activities under anesthesia where SuM is insensitive, but MM is sensitive to medial septal (MS) inactivation, theta LFPs persisted and became indistinguishable after MS-inactivation. However, MS-inactivation attenuated SuM/MM theta power, while increasing the frequency of SuM/MM theta. MS-inactivation also reduced root <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> <b>power</b> in both HPC and SuM/MM equally, but reduced theta power differentially in the time domain. We provide converging evidence that SuM is preferentially involved in coding HPC theta at higher frequencies, and that the MS-HPC circuit normally imposes a frequency-limiting modulation over the SuM/MM area as suggested by cell-based recordings in anesthetized animals. In addition, we provide evidence that the postulated SuM-MS-HPC-MM circuit is under complex bi-directional control, rather than SuM and MM having roles as unidirectional relays in the network...|$|R

In addition, an intrinsically synchronized near-IR output delivering optical pulses with 15 μJ energy, 96 fs duration at 1. 62 μm center wavelength is derived from the system—this additional output can be used for multi-color experiments or impulsive alignment. The excellent long-term stability of less than 1 % root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> (rms) <b>power</b> fluctuations over 12. 5 h at 160 kHz makes this source an ideal driver for nonlinear optics experiments, in particular mid-IR-driven strong-field physics and attoscience.
