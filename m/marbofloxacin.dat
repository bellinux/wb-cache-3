P. aeruginosa strains can develop resistance quickly against certain antibiotics if used alone, thus the need emerges to find synergistic combinations. A total of 68 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs were examined. In order to describe interactions between <b>marbofloxacin</b> and gentamicin the checkerboard microdilution method was utilized. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for <b>marbofloxacin</b> and gentamicin were in the range 0. 25 – 64 mg/L and 0. 25 – 32 mg/L, respectively. The combination of <b>marbofloxacin</b> and gentamicin was more effective with a MIC range of 0. 031 – 8 mg/L and a MIC 90 of 1 mg/L, compared to 16 mg/L for <b>marbofloxacin</b> alone and 8 mg/L for gentamicin alone. The FIC (fractional inhibitory concentration) indices ranged from 0. 0945 (pronounced synergy) to 1. 0625 (indifference). Synergy between <b>marbofloxacin</b> and gentamicin was found in 33 isolates. The mean FIC index is 0. 546, which represents a partial synergistic/additive effect close to the full synergy threshold.

A single dose of 8 mg/kg body weight (bw) was administrated orally to healthy pigs and serum samples were collected during the next 72 h. Serum <b>marbofloxacin</b> content was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. We estimated the Cmax (6. 28 μg/ml), AUC 0 - 24 h (60. 30 μg. h/ml), AUC 0 -∞ (88. 94 μg. h/ml), T 1 / 2 ke, (12. 48 h), Tmax (0. 75 h) and Clb (0. 104 L/h) of <b>marbofloxacin</b> in pigs, as well as the bioavailability of <b>marbofloxacin</b> (94. 21 %) after a single 8 mg/kg oral administration.

40|$|Background: Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) can {{invade the}} body and cause {{systemic}} infection under stress conditions. <b>Marbofloxacin</b> has been recommended {{for the treatment of}} swine infections. However, few studies have investigated the PK/PD characteristics and PK/PD cutoff (COPD) of this drug against H. parasuis. Results: MICs of <b>marbofloxacin</b> against 198 H. parasuis isolates were determined. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 were 2 and 8 mg/L, respectively. An in vitro dynamic PK/PD model was established to study the PK/PD relationship of <b>marbofloxacin</b> against H. parasuis. The PK/PD surrogate markers Cmax/MIC, Cmax/MPC (the maximum concentration divided by MIC or mutant prevention concentration (MPC)) and AUC 24 h/MIC, AUC 24 h/MPC (the area under the curve during the first 24 h divided by MIC or MPC) simulated the antimicrobial effect of <b>marbofloxacin</b> successfully with the R 2 of 0. 9928 and 0. 9911, respectively. The target values of 3 -log 10 -unit and 4 -log 10 -unit reduction for AUC 24 h/MPC were 33 and 42, while the same efficacy for AUC 24 h/MIC were 88 and 110. The COPD deduced from Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for <b>marbofloxacin</b> against H. parasuis was 0. 5 mg/L. The recommended dose of <b>marbofloxacin</b> against H. parasuis with MIC ≤ 2 mg/L was 16 mg/kg body weight (BW).

For example, the longer half-life of <b>marbofloxacin</b> in many animal species has been appreciated in veterinary practice. It is generally accepted that, for fluoroquinolones, the optimal dose should be estimated {{on the basis of the}} pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of the drug under consideration. Knowledge of these specific data for the target animal species allows the establishment of an integrated PK-PD model that is of high predictive value. In the present study, the antibacterial efficacy (PD indices) against a field isolate of Escherichia coli O 78 /K 80 was investigated ex vivo following oral and intravenous administration of <b>marbofloxacin</b> to turkeys (breed BUT 9; six animals per group) at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight (BW). At the same time, the serum concentrations of <b>marbofloxacin</b> were measured at different time intervals by a standardized high-performance liquid chromatography method, allowing the calculation of the most relevant kinetic parameters (PK parameters). The in vitro serum inhibitory activity of <b>marbofloxacin</b> against the selected E. coli strain, O 78 /K 80, was 0. 5 μg/ml in the blood serum of turkeys, and the ratio of the maximum concentration of the drug in serum to the serum inhibitory activity was 1. 34. The lowest ratio of the measured serum concentration multiplied by the incubation period of 24 h to the serum inhibitory activity required for bacterial elimination was lower than the ratio of the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) to the serum inhibitory activity. These first results suggested that the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg BW of <b>marbofloxacin</b> is sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect in diseased animals. However, considering the risk of resistance induction, the applied dose should be equal to an AUC/MIC of > 125, the generally recommended dose for all fluoroquinolones. According to the PK-PD results presented here, a dose of 3. 0 to 12. 0 mg/kg BW per day would be needed to meet this criterion. In conclusion, the results of the present study provide the rationale for an optimal dose regimen for <b>marbofloxacin</b> in turkeys and hence should form the basis for dose selection in forthcoming clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} (PD) {{properties of}} the fluoroquinolone, <b>marbofloxacin,</b> were determined for the bovine respiratory tract pathogens Mannheima haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. For six pathogenic isolates of each organism, three in vitro indices of efficacy and potency were determined, namely, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill curves. Each parameter was determined in two matrices, Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) and calf serum. For serum, MBC:MIC ratios were 2. 7 : 1 (M. haemolytica) and 2. 4 : 1 (P. multocida). The killing action of <b>marbofloxacin</b> had the characteristics of concentration dependency against M. haemolytica and co-dependency (on time and concentration) against P. multocida. To confirm {{the characteristics of the}} time-kill profiles, growth inhibition produced by <b>marbofloxacin</b> was also established ex vivo in three biological fluids, calf serum, exudate and transudate, harvested from a tissue cage model. The in vitro time-kill data were modelled with pharmacokinetic properties of <b>marbofloxacin,</b> established by intramuscular administration in calves at a dose of 2 mg/kg; three levels of activity, namely bacteriostatic, 3 log 10 reduction and 4 log 10 reduction in bacterial counts were determined. Mean AUC(24 h) /MIC values (with percentage coefficients of variation indicating inter-isolate variability) for M. haemolytica, based on serum MICs, were 31. 3 (41. 6), 57. 7 (42. 4) and 79. 2 (44. 6) h, respectively. Corresponding values for MHB were 20. 5 (58. 0), 40. 5 (51. 8) and 51. 2 (24. 30) h, respectively. When allowance was made for binding of <b>marbofloxacin</b> to serum protein, the AUC(24 h) /MIC values for serum were similar to those for MHB.

The lambs were monitored before and after treatment and the clinical findings were scored; they were euthanatised 42 days after treatment for pathological examination of the lungs. Groups were similar {{at the start of a}} field trial with respect to all parameters (general clinical condition, presence of nasal discharge, presence of ophthalmic discharge, results of lung auscultation) evaluated (P > 0. 05). After treatment, no systemic or local adverse reactions were observed in any lamb. Forty-two days after treatment, the median general clinical assessment score of groups MH, ML 3 and T was 0, that of group ML 2 was I and that of group C lambs was 2 (P < 0. 01). Treatment with <b>marbofloxacin</b> was associated with improved clinical scores; the results were similar for all evaluations 14 days after treatment and subsequently. Clinical cure rate 42 days after treatment was 100, 100, 42, 100 and 0 % for group MH, ML 3, ML 2, T and C lambs, respectively (P < 0. 01). After controlling for initial weight, treatment was found to have a significant effect on carcass weight (P < 0. 01). Pairwise differences in lung lesion scores between any of the four treated groups and the untreated controls were significant (P < 0. 02). It is concluded that <b>marbofloxacin</b> is effective against respiratory infections of lambs at a dose rate of 3. 0 mg/kg bodyweight given on two occasions, once daily 2 days apart or at a dose rate of 2. 0 mg/kg given on three occasions for three consecutive days.
