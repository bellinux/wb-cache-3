Male Wistar rats were given a single intratracheal instillation of 2 mg of Union Internationale Contre le Cancer chrysotile or refractory ceramic fiber (RF 1). The animals then inhaled a side stream of smoke 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The expression of manganese superoxide dismutase, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF), interleukin- 1 [alpha] (IL- 1 [alpha]), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF[alpha]) mRNA from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated AMs and lungs of rats exposed to <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and/or cigarette smoke were assessed using semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Exposure only to cigarette smoke increased in IL- 1 [alpha] mRNA levels in AMs. Chrysotile stimulated the expression of IL- 1 [alpha], TNF[alpha], and IL- 6 in AMs, and the expression of bFGF in lungs. RF 1 resulted in increased expression of IL- 1 [alpha] and TNF[alpha] in AMs. Cigarette smoke stimulated the gene expression of iNOS in AMs and IL- 6 and bFGF in lungs treated with chrysotile; IL- 1 [alpha] in AMs and bFGF in lungs did the same in lungs with RF 1. Among these cytokines, message levels of IL- 1 [alpha], iNOS, and bFGF were increased in rats stimulated with <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers,</b> and the stimulating effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> were enhanced by cigarette smoke. Therefore, IL- 1 [alpha], iNOS, and bFGF would be the possible parameters of the lung remodeling induced by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and cigarette smoke on remodeling of lung tissues, we examined matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1), MMP- 2, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1), TIMP- 2, and types and IV collagen mRNA levels from rat lungs exposed to <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and/or cigarette smoke in vivo. Male Wistar rats (10 weeks of age) were given a single intratracheal instillation of 2 mg of chrysotile or alumina silicate ceramic fibers (RCF). Animals were then exposed to cigarette smoke (side stream) 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Transcriptional levels of mRNA extracted from the lungs were assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Exposure to cigarette smoke induced increases in MMP- 1 and TIMP- 1 mRNA levels and decreased TIMP- 2 and type collagen mRNA levels in lung. Chrysotile or RCF stimulated the expression of MMP- 1 mRNA in the lung. The <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and cigarette smoke had more than additive effects on the expression of MMP- 2 and TIMP- 1 in the lung.

40|$|Oncogenesis and {{in vitro}} data (reported {{elsewhere}} in detail) are compared {{on the basis}} of relative activity by mass and by dimensional fiber parameters. When tumor induction is compared to the number of fibers of various lengths and aspect ratios in the dose in rats to the degree of tumor induction, a degree of difference with the long thin fiber concept of tumorigenesis by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> is noted. Consistency is re-established, however, when cognizance is taken of the change in the length and aspect ratio that took place during residence in the lung. This change resulted in a severalfold excess for ferroactinolite of all fiber lengths with high aspect ratios, produced as a result of longitudinal splitting of the introduced fibers. The response by mass in the in vitro procedures did not mimic oncogenesis. When mass was so adjusted that there were an equal number of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers,</b> aspect ratio greater than 3, for dose for the two minerals, agreement was closer in both the rabbit alveolar macrophage toxicity test and the clonal cytotoxicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, <b>mineral</b> <b>fiber</b> batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and {{particulates}} represent one of {{the best}} documented, economically important, and ubiquitously occurring categories of human carcinogens. Yet, while a wealth of information exists concerning the mechanism of action of physical, chemical, and viral carcinogens, virtually nothing is known relative to the mechanism of action of this economically important class of carcinogenic compounds known as <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> and particulates. While the length and diameter of various forms of asbestos have been associated with both cellular toxicity in vitro and tumor occurrence in vivo, nothing is known about whether or not these same physical properties are responsible for the purported synergistic interaction between cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure relative to the induction of bronchogenic carcinoma. Thus, while the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma for nonsmokers exposed to asbestos appears to be only slightly greater than that for unexposed nonsmoking populations, the risk of occurrence of this same tumor in asbestos workers who also smoke is approximately 100 -fold greater than in nonsmoking asbestos workers. The risk of bronchogenic carcinoma is increased approximately 8 -fold in asbestos workers who smoke over nonexposed smokers. Since it is clear that cigarette smoke contains over 150 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are known animal carcinogens, and since other laboratories have reported that metals associated with asbestos redirect the metabolism of these agents, it was of interest to us to investigate the effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> on the metabolism and biochemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exposure to <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> is of {{substantial}} relevance to human health. A key event in exposure is the interaction with inflammatory cells {{and the subsequent}} generation of pro-inflammatory factors. Mast cells (MCs) {{have been shown to}} interact with titanium oxide (TiO 2) and asbestos fibers. In this study, we compared the response of rat peritoneal MCs challenged with the asbestos crocidolite and nanowires of TiO 2 to that induced by wollastonite employed as a control fiber. Methods: Rat peritoneal MCs (RPMCs), isolated from peritoneal lavage, were incubated in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibers.</b> The quantities of secreted enzymes were evaluated together with the activity of fiber-associated enzymes. The ultrastructural morphology of fiber-interacting RPMCs was analyzed with electron microscopy. Results: Asbestos and TiO 2 stimulate MC secretion. Secreted enzymes bind to fibers and exhibit higher activity. TiO 2 and wollastonite bind and improve enzyme activity, but to a lesser degree than crocidolite. Conclusions: (1) <b>Mineral</b> <b>fibers</b> are able to stimulate the mast cell secretory process by both active (during membrane interaction) and/or passive (during membrane penetration) interaction; (2) fibers can be found to be associated with secreted enzymes—this process appears to create long-lasting pro-inflammatory environments and may represent the active contribution of MCs in maintaining the inflammatory process; (3) MCs and their enzymes should be considered as a therapeutic target in the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced lung inflammation; and (4) MCs can contribute to the inflammatory effect associated with selected engineered nanomaterials, such as TiO 2 nanoparticles...|$|R
