40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} maximum wind power extrac-tion for a wind energy {{conversion}} system composed of a wind tur-bine, a squirrel-cage induction generator, and a matrix converter (MC). At a given wind velocity, the mechanical power available from a wind turbine {{is a function of}} its shaft speed. In order to track maximum power, the MC adjusts the induction generator terminal frequency, and thus, the turbine shaft speed. The MC also adjusts the reactive power transfer at the grid interface to-ward voltage regulation or power factor correction. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is included in the control system. Conclusions about the effectiveness of the proposed scheme are supported by analysis and simulation results.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} matrix converter-based active {{distribution}} transformer (MC-ADT) with enhanced control functionalities {{to be used}} in smart grids (SG). The proposed MC-ADT uses a matrix converter (MC) connected to a transformer inserted in series with the grid, and allows: 1) real-time voltage regulation of the low-voltage side of the MC-ADT, based on an adjustable reference value defined by the SG requirements and bounded by the standard values; 2) capability to regulate the LV grid voltage even in case of sags, voltage rises, and overvoltages in the transformer medium-voltage side; and 3) contribution to power factor correction in the MV side. The MC-ADT grid voltage regulators are synthesized, establishing the MC reference currents. To guarantee the tracking of the <b>MC</b> <b>input</b> and output reference currents, the space vector representation, together with sliding-mode direct control techniques, are used. The obtained experimental and simulation results show that the proposed system is able to regulate the LV grid voltages even for sags and overvoltages up to 20 % in the MV side, and contributes to power factor correction in MV, while presenting fast dynamic response, without overshoot and almost zero steady-state error. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Modulated {{electron}} radiotherapy (MERT) promises sparing {{of organs}} {{at risk for}} certain tumor sites. Any implementation of MERT treatment planning requires an accurate beam model. The aim of this work {{is the development of}} a beam model which reconstructs electron fields shaped using the Millennium photon multileaf collimator (MLC) (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for a Varian linear accelerator (linac). METHODS This beam model is divided into an analytical part (two photon and two electron sources) and a Monte Carlo (MC) transport through the MLC. For dose calculation purposes the beam model has been coupled with a macro MC dose calculation algorithm. The commissioning process requires a set of measurements and precalculated <b>MC</b> <b>input.</b> The beam model has been commissioned at a source to surface distance of 70 cm for a Clinac 23 EX (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and a TrueBeam linac (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA).

Furthermore, a measured two-dimensional dose distribution for patched segments consisting of three 18 MeV segments, three 12 MeV segments, and a 9 MeV segment is compared with corresponding dose calculations. Finally, measured and calculated two-dimensional dose distributions are compared for a circular segment encompassed with a C-shaped segment.

40|$|Currently {{the most}} precise LHC {{measurements}} of the top quark mass are determinations of the top quark mass parameter of Monte-Carlo (MC) event generators reaching uncertainties of well below 1 GeV. However, there is an additional theoretical problem when using the MC top mass m_t^ <b>MC</b> as an <b>input</b> for theoretical predictions, because a rigorous relation of m_t^ MC to a renormalized field theory mass is, at the very strict level, absent. In this talk I show how - nevertheless - some concrete statements on m_t^ MC can be deduced assuming that the MC generator behaves like a rigorous first principles QCD calculator for the observables that are used for the analyses. I give simple conceptual arguments showing that in this context m_t^ MC can be interpreted like the mass of a heavy-light top meson, {{and that there is}} a conversion relation to field theory top quark masses that requires a non-perturbative input. The situation is in analogy to B physics where a similar relation exists between experimental B meson masses and field theory bottom masses. The relation gives a prescription how to use m_t^ <b>MC</b> as an <b>input</b> for theoretical predictions in perturbative QCD. The outcome is that at this time an additional uncertainty of about 1 GeV has to be accounted for. I discuss limitations of the arguments I give and possible ways to test them, or even to improve the current situation. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

The major contribution of this paper is the elimination of the detrimental common-mode voltage (CMV) that appears across the motor winding. In addition, the proposed SVM allows for a unity power factor at the input side, while boosting the output phase voltage by up to 150 % of input. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis, to obtain the expression for the SVM modulating signals that are used to generate the switching pulses for the MC. To verify the idea, a modular, reconfigurable 5 -kW MC prototype, feeding a five-phase induction motor is built. The control algorithm is implemented on a dSPACE- 1006 platform.

40|$|Total disc {{replacement}} (TDR) is {{a modern}} technique employed to treat degenerative disc disease that has the benefit of preserving motion compared with the clinically established spinal fusion. The wear performance of implants based on articulating designs is a key factor that determines their longevity and it is hypothesized {{that this will be}} the case for TDR devices. A detailed analysis of the surface of Charité lumbar disc replacements during simulated wear for five million cycles (<b>MC),</b> with <b>inputs</b> defined by the ISO 18192 - 1 standard, is presented. After each million cycles the disc asperity heights, asperity curvature radii and their distributions {{on the surface of the}} core of the implant were determined at different locations. Two distinct areas on the surface of Charité polyethylene disc were identified based on the surface topography change during the wear simulation process. Within the area corresponding to the dome the initial roughness decreased, but after 2 MC the surface appeared to roughen with material build-up. More peripherally on the dome the surface roughness decreased after the first MC and remained constant. No effect was noticed on the rim. Furthermore, no statistical difference was noticed between the inferior and superior sides of the core of the disc. The study demonstrated that the wear on the two surfaces of the disc was uneven. This spatial variation is important in modelling the wear processes and providing strategies for reducing wear through enhanced design and modifications to the biotribological properties of the device...|$|R
40|$|The major {{challenge}} in the aerospace industry represents the design of technologies and electrically powered systems to improve the performances of tomorrow`s aircraft. In the last 30 years significant researches are made to increase the overall reliability, availability, efficiency, maintainability and operational costs {{for the next generation}} of aircrafts. The general requirements of these power circuits are: the system must be fault tolerant with ability to continue operating properly (possibly at a reduced level) in case of a failure, the systems must have small size, low weight and must work in harsh conditions such as high temperature, humidity, vibrations and low maintenance. Matrix Converter is an "all silicon" solution which can direct connect an AC source to an AC load without the need of DC-link electrolytic capacitor. This AC to AC topology is a very promising alternative topology which can replace the actual two step power conversion solution, AC to DC to AC. The advantages of this topology are related to the lack of DC-link electrolytic capacitor, high output voltage quality, high input current quality, power factor control, high dynamic response, four quadrant operation, low current and low voltage stress of bidirectional switches. Despite these advantages, their market penetration is quite low, mainly due to their poor voltage transfer ratio, complexity in terms of structure and control, higher sensibility to input disturbances and its load parameter dependent. The main goal of this work is to design and implement a MC topology which can be used for aircraft applications. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters and in the end are presented the conclusions, appendices and references. In Chapter 1 the research starts with the presentation of the actual electrical system of an aircraft Boeing 787 and continues with the presentation of possible topologies which can be true fault tolerant. Next, a comparison is made between the most suitable topologies which can be used in AC to AC power conversion (MC and V-BBC) from the power components needed point of view for a three-phase load. The Chapter 2 is dedicated to MC study and analysis. Within this part, are presented the most used MC topology structures (DMC and IMC). An important part of the study is focused on bidirectional switches arrangement, safe commutation methods for bidirectional switches and control methods which can be applied. Next, in Chapter 3 the study continues with <b>MC</b> <b>input</b> filter design. <b>MC</b> is a direct AC to AC power conversion and because of this, special protection circuits are designed. An important part of the chapter is accorded to power switches selection and currents, voltages and temperature measurement circuits. In Chapter, 4 the DMC is simulated for two different control methods, 2 L-PWM and DSVM. The simulations are made for two types of source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz on a RL load. Chapter 5 contains the electrical circuit schemes and the layout of the DMC "Main Board" and "Driver Board" which are used in prototype realization. Chapter 6 is divided into experimental test results for individual components and experimental results of DMC with DSVM algorithm for both source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz. Finally, at the end of the thesis are presented the conclusions drawn from this research and recommendations for future work which must be done to improve the waveforms quality. In the appendices sections is presented the code used in Matlab-Simulink for both simulations and also the LabVIEW implementation of the DSVM algorithm.

A new switching strategy is introduced based on the maximum compensated angle. Then, power factor Improved by using the new DSVM method to achieve the maximum IPF are presented, in which compensation algorithm I is based on using the input filter and power supply parameters to estimate the optimal compensated angle. Compensation algorithm II is subsequently proposed using a proportional–integral controller to overcome drawbacks presented in compensation algorithm I. Simulation results are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation algorithms.

Neutronic analyses have been performed starting from a MC model of the entire reactor system, based on the MCNP 5 code, that was already validated in fresh fuel and zero-power configuration (in which thermal effects are negligible) using the available experimental data as benchmark. In order to describe the full-power reactor configuration, the temperature distribution in the core is necessary.

40|$|A Matrix Converter (MC) is an ac-ac power {{converter}} {{which has been}} proposed for applications requiring a critical volume/weight ratio. However, those applications often require {{a high level of}} reliability/availability. Therefore, a fault-tolerant capability needs to be incorporated within the control/operation of the MC so that a fault occurrence does not lead to serious effects on the safety and system performance. Fault tolerance involves several steps including fault detection/location, isolation, and reconfiguration of the system so the converter can continue to operate {{as close as possible to}} its normal conditions. In this way, a partial failure in the converter does not lead to the shutdown of the whole system. The aim of this research is to improve the fault tolerance of the MC under open-switch fault conditions. This research develops two different fault detection methods, one based on monitoring load voltages and one based on monitoring load currents to detect and isolate a faulty switch. A post-fault modulation strategy in which, without inclusion of any additional hardware and based on the remaining healthy switches, the MC continues to operate under an open-switch fault, is proposed. The proposed post-fault strategy is extended to operate the <b>MC</b> under unbalanced <b>input</b> voltage conditions. Performance/effectiveness of the proposed fault detection methods and the post-fault strategies is evaluated based on simulations studies in the MATLAB/SIMULINK software environment and experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy is {{a common}} tool used by clinicians in the {{treatment}} of breast cancer patients. This thesis investigates the calculation and measurement of phantom surface dose during an IMRT breast radiation therapy dose delivery. Measurements were taken to prototype the MOSkin dosimeters placed on an anthropomorphic phantom. The dose measurements are also indicative of skin doses that patients are likely to receive with and without Orfit immobilisation cast material in place during radiation therapy. The first part of this thesis is focussed on the beam modelling of the Pinnacle planning computer. In particular, it focusses on the ability of the planning system to accurately model a medical linear accelerator and calculate dose distributions in the build-up region. The reason this is relevant is because to date, planning system calculations are inaccurate in the build-up region, and calculated doses are thus discarded pieces of information. It was found that build-up dose calculations using a treatment planning system (TPS) could be improved by using Monte Carlo (<b>MC)</b> data as <b>input</b> to the beam modelling algorithm. These calculations were performed in cuboid phantom geometry as a precursor to curved contours. The last part of this thesis investigates the dosimetric impact of using an immobilisation cast in breast radiotherapy. This study involved an anthropomorphic phantom and the use of EBT GafChromic film and MOSkins to investigate the magnitude of dose deposition at skin depth both with, and without, the Orfit immobilisation cast present. Dosimetric measurements were reported at numerous points of clinical interest to determine whether the Orfit immobilisation cast may be used in radiotherapy of the breast. Results show increases in dose to the breast surface, the clinical significance of which may be a matter for consideration by clinicians...|$|R
40|$|In the {{olfactory}} bulb and other brain areas, basic cellular and synaptic properties of individual neurons {{have been studied}} extensively in reduced preparations. Nevertheless, it is still poorly understood how intactions between multiple neurons shape spatio-temporal activity patterns and give rise to the computational properties of the the intact circuit. In this thesis, I used pharmacological manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors to examine the synaptic interactions underlying spontaneous and odor-evoked activity patterns in the intact {{olfactory bulb}} of zebrafish. Electrophysiological and one- and two-photon calcium imaging methods were used to record activity from the principal neurons of the OB (mitral cells, <b>MCs),</b> their sensory <b>input,</b> and local interneurons. The combined blockade of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors abolished odor-evoked excitation of MCs, indicating that sensory input to the OB is mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors. Surprisingly, however, the blockade of AMPA/Kainiate receptors alone increased the mean response of MCs and decreased the mean response of interneurons (INs), and the blockade of NMDA receptors caused little or {{no change in the}} mean responses of MCs and INs. In addition, antagonists of both glutamate receptor types had diverse effects on the magnitude and time course of individual MC and IN responses and, thus, changed spatio-temporal activity patterns across neuronal populations. The blockade of GABA(A) receptors increased spontaneous and odor evoked firing rates of mitral cells and often induced rhythmic bursting. Moreover, the blockade of, GABA(A) or AMPA/kainate receptors abolished fast oscillatory activity in the local field potential. Blockade of GABA(B) receptors reduced calcium influx in afferent sensory axons and modulated response time courses of mitral cells. These results indicate that (1) IN activity during an odor response depends mainly on AMPA/Kainiate receptor input, (2) interactions between MCs and INs regulate the total OB output activity, (3) AMPA/Kainiate receptors and GABA(A) receptors underly the synchronization of odor-dependent neuronal ensembles and (4) odor-specific patterns of OB output activity are shaped by circuits containing iGlu receptors and GABA receptors. These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the processing of odor-encoding activity patterns in the OB...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Tomotherapy {{treatment}} unit {{is designed to}} deliver highly modulated IMRT treatments. Because {{of the complexity of}} the treatment, inaccuracies may occur for convolution/superposition based algorithms specially in inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo (MC) calculations’ validity, instead, is not limited by the complexity of the treatment and it is therefore a tool of choice to calculate accurately dose distribution provided by IMRT treatments, specially in a highly heterogeneous media (head and neck tumors, …). The concept of Tomotherapy provides new challenges in MC simulations, since simultaneous movement of the gantry, the couch and the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) must be simulated accurately. However, before accounting for gantry and couch movement, high accuracy must be achieved while simulating the static mode (gantry and MLC are not moving during irradiation). The aim {{of this study is to}} firstly model the static mode, i. e. static open fields as well as the MLC. Since the transport of the particles through the MLC is time consuming, the second purpose of the work is to find a technique where fast simulation of the MLC is performed without losing significant accuracy. This is done through analytical operations thanks to a transformation called “transfer function” (TF). Material and methods During the commissioning process of the MC model, the calculations are compared to measurements performed in a water tank, with an EXTRADIN A 1 SL ion chamber (Standard Imaging), with the SSD equal to 85 cm. Moreover, for some MLC configurations when high geometric resolution is required, profiles are measured with EDR- 2 film in a solid water phantom (SSD = 85 cm, depth = 1. 5 cm). The MC simulation is based on the PENELOPE code, which can simulate any geometry configuration, provided that the different elements of the geometry are delimited by quadric surfaces. Since the geometry and materials are fully disclosed by the manufacturer, negligible approximations are made in our <b>MC</b> geometry <b>input</b> file. The only parameters that can be tuned on are therefore electron source spot size and electron energy. The model is commissioned the three static open fields available in Tomotherapy {{treatment unit}}s (1 x 40 cm², 2. 5 x 40 cm² and 5 x 40 cm²). The MLC is also defined according to detailed technical drawings. The validation of the geometry is performed thanks to MLC configurations where it is possible to verify the geometry of each individual leaves as well as the whole leaf bank. TF is applied as follows. For all the particles (photons) of the phase space, at most three attenuation coefficients are linked and calculated according to the raylength of the photon in each leaf it passes. If the photon rayline passes through more than three leaves, the particle is killed. In a specific MLC configuration, the weight of all the particles will or will not be multiplied by the attenuation coefficient depending on which leaf is closed or open. It should be mentioned that the attenuation coefficients are calculated using the cross section database of PENELOPE. Results Good agreement is obtained for the three static open fields with deviations smaller than 2 % of dose maximum and 1 mm in high dose gradients region. Similar results were achieved for the MLC in the full MC mode. With the TF, it was shown that no significant deviations were introduced, except in the build up region were the absence of contamination electrons in the transformed phase space file yields to some differences. Thanks to the tools developed in this study, a reliable and fast simulation of Tomotherapy in the helical mode can now be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 In {{order to}} {{investigate}} potential climate impacts on landscape-scale ecosystem processes, I implemented a dynamic general vegetation model (DGVM) {{over a large}} domain in northern California and western Nevada on a rectangular grid of ca. 800 -meter spatial resolution. I used 100 years of observed, monthly climate and nine future climate projections {{in an attempt to}} explore the range of possible climate futures in the region. I selected three general circulation models (MIROC 3. 2 (medres), UKMO-HadCM 3 and CSIRO-Mk 3. 0), incorporating a range of 2 xCO₂ temperature sensitivity. Each GCM was run through three carbon dioxide emissions scenarios (SRES A 2, A 1 B and B 1). For this analysis, I focused the study on the simulated ecological impacts under the three A 2 scenarios. Historical observations and future climate scenarios were interpolated to the 800 -meter grid by the PRISM model. MC 1, a systems-based DGVM, compared favorably to observed data for simulations of vegetation distribution and annual streamflow. MC 1 slightly overestimated annual production in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains and underestimated it in the Coast Range and Eastern Cascades. MC 1 displayed a low bias for annual area burned and high bias for pyrogenic emissions. Validation of simulated model output was complicated because MC 1 does not consider the effects of land management on ecosystems and the study region is heavily-impacted by development, logging, fire suppression, grazing and pre-European, indigenous land-use and burning. Under all future climate projections, an increase in growing season length and temperature led to the replacement of tundra and subalpine vegetation types with temperate conifer forest. Increased winter minimum temperatures promoted the expansion of mixed needleleaf-broadleaf forest, particularly in the mid-elevations of the Sierra Nevada and in coastal forests. In the MIROC 3. 2 and HadCM 3 scenarios, ecosystem-level net primary productivity (NPP) did not increase with enhanced CO₂ fertilization because production remained limited by water, even though both NPP and water-use-efficiency were increased at the leaf level in proportion to CO₂ concentration. Increases in NPP were projected in CSIRO-Mk 3, but increased precipitation and warmer temperatures also increased rates of heterotrophic respiration for no net gain in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Fire extent and severity increased in all scenarios, mostly driven by significant decreases in mountainous snowpack and earlier snowmelt. Thus, a relatively constant NEP and increased fire emissions produced decreases in total ecosystem carbon across all future scenarios. Projected annual streamflow varied between future climate scenarios and was highly influenced by projected precipitation. In all future simulations, high-elevation mountainous landscapes were highly sensitive to projected changes in climate, largely attributable to an increased growing season and temperature, decreased snowpack and reduced fire return interval. Coastal forests were also highly susceptible to changes in vegetation type and increases in fire. Several sources contribute to uncertainty in <b>MC</b> 1, including <b>input</b> datasets, model assumptions, uncertainties in ecosystem science, and questions of scale. Therefore, these results should be considered preliminary, but useful in suggesting a range of plausible ecological futures as we continue to refine model capabilities...|$|R
