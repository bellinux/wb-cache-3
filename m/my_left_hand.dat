[...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket."

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E

The road all along was kept clear, & there was no pushing or squeezing. Constant cheering & noises of every kind, but the horses went beautifully. George & the Staff met just within the Quadrangle Entrance of the Palace, & preceded us. The sight in Hyde Park was very fine, the tribunes & stands, full of spectators, the Royal one being in the centre. After riding down the Line the ceremony of giving medals, began. There were 47 in number, with blue ribbons for the Navy, & red, for the Army. I remained on horseback, fastening the medals, or crosses, on recipient sic. Some were in plain clothes, - one a Gate Keeper & one a Policeman*. Lord Panmure stood to <b>my</b> <b>left,</b> <b>handing</b> me the medals, & to my right, Sir C. Wood, whilst the naval men were being decorated, & Sir G. Weatherall; for the soldiers, each reading the names out, as the men came up”.|$|R

She must have heard what I had done to Lauren because when I got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.'

2500|$|Over time, Log {{acquired}} a kick-drum and a homemade foot cymbal which he custom-outfitted with a kick pedal of its own. These instruments, combined with his slide guitar work, telephone microphone vocals, and drum machine accompaniment, form the framework on which Bob Log constructs his songs. Log describes his on-stage setup {{in the song}} [...] "One Man Band Boom", introducing himself to the audience as, [...] "Bob Log the third, one-man band, Tucson, Arizona. Heyeeeh!

2500|$|James {{first learned}} to play the cello {{as a child in}} North Carolina and {{switched}} to the guitar in 1960. His guitar style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: [...] "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand." [...] He began attending Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts in fall 1961. Summering before then with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar quickly realized that Taylor's singing had a [...] "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that thing." [...] Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly. By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as [...] "Jamie & Kootch".|$|E
2500|$|The Razors Edge was {{recorded}} at Windmill Road Studios in Dublin, Ireland and Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, {{who had previously}} worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. [...] According to the book AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, George Young was involved early on but had to bow out because of personal issues. [...] Lead singer Brian Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases (In a 1995 interview, Johnson told Guitar World that he was relieved at not {{having to deal with}} the pressure of writing the lyrics anymore). The instantly recognizable opening riff to [...] "Thunderstruck" [...] features Young alternating between fretted notes and playing the open string. [...] In a 1993 interview with Guitar Worlds Alan Di Perna, the guitarist recalls, [...] "I was just fiddling with <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> when I came up with that riff; I played it more by accident than anything.

6000|$|She answered, 'No mortal is able {{entirely to}} {{understand}} {{the power of this}} ring, because no one thoroughly understands the secret signs engraved upon it. But even with my half-knowledge I can work great wonders. If I put the ring upon the little finger of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> then I can fly like a bird through the air wherever I wish to go. If I put it on the third finger of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> I am invisible, and I can see everything that passes around me, though no one can see me. If I put the ring upon the middle finger of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> then neither fire nor water nor any sharp weapon can hurt me. If I put it on the forefinger of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> then I can with its help produce whatever I wish. I can in a single moment build houses or anything I desire. Finally, as long as I wear the ring on the thumb of <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks and walls. Besides these, the ring has other secret signs which, as I said, no one can understand. No doubt it contains secrets of great importance. The ring formerly belonged to King Solomon, the wisest of kings, during whose reign the wisest men lived. But it is not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands: it is supposed that an angel gave it to the wise King.' ...|$|E

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved.

5000|$|In 2015, Merchant {{released}} {{an album of}} all-new recordings of the songs from her multi-platinum solo album. She spoke of making the album for her loyal fans, to honor the journey that both they and the songs have taken together over the last 20 years.

It's a fictional story that <b>left</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and belongs entirely to those people who, like me, suffered the State as an executioner-intrusion installed {{in the center of}} the most sacred relationship: the family. The novel talks of the desertions of the soul, not only does it touch on the heartbreaking geographical exodus, we are talking about the flight of family and close friends in the name of a slogan or political responsibility.|$|R

Until 1938, Paige threw mostly hard fastballs and an occasional curveball. Before the 1939 season, Paige suffered an arm injury that robbed his fastball of some velocity. Paige responded by adding a changeup and experimenting with different arm angles. Then, in 1943, Paige debuted the [...] "hesitation pitch": In 1933, while playing integrated baseball in Bismarck, North Dakota, The Bismarck Tribune reported that Paige used [...] "a tricky delayed delivery with great effectiveness."The idea came to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball.
