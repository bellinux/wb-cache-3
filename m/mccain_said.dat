5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he was {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of}} the general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5000|$|A {{statement}} by the McCain 2008 presidential campaign {{on the subject of}} the black <b>McCains</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How the Teoc descendents have served their community, and by extension, their country, is a testament to the power of family, love, compassion, and the human spirit." ...|$|R
5000|$|On September 16, a <b>McCain</b> {{spokesperson}} <b>said</b> [...] "the {{governor is}} not going to cooperate with that Branchflower investigation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Newsweek {{reported}} {{that at the}} time of the Couric interview, Palin felt that she had been overmanaged for her first one-on-one debut with a network anchor, Charlie Gibson of ABC and [...] "rebuffed Wallace's help with her Couric interview." [...] <b>McCain</b> advisers <b>said</b> that Palin [...] "did not have the time or focus to prepare for the interview." [...] "She did not say, 'I will not prepare,'" [...] a <b>McCain</b> adviser <b>said.</b> [...] "She just didn't have a bandwidth to do a mock interview session the way we had prepared before. She was just overloaded." ...|$|R
25|$|In September 2007, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that he {{supported}} a 65% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 South Ossetia war, McCain reacted {{strongly}} to Russia’s widening assault against Georgia. <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> Europe {{and other nations}} must be united against such acts, and proclaimed support for the U.S.’s closest ally among the democratizing former Soviet republics. He {{also pointed out that}} NATO should reconsider its decision to deny Georgia the fast track for NATO membership. That decision “might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia,” <b>McCain</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early April, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he had {{compiled}} a list of roughly 20 potential running mates, and that he hoped to have selected a Vice President well before the Republican Convention in September.|$|E
5000|$|On September 18, 2008, presidential {{candidate}} and Senator John <b>McCain</b> (R-AZ) <b>said</b> that the SEC allowed short-selling to turn [...] "our markets into a casino." [...] McCain criticized the SEC and its Chairman for eliminating the uptick rule.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, on {{the week}} of the {{nomination}} vote, dozens of radio stations were called on the same day asking talk show hosts what they thought of McCain's fathering of a black child out of wedlock. <b>McCain</b> later <b>said</b> of the incidents: ...|$|R
2500|$|However, on February 18, 2007, he stated, [...] "I do {{not support}} Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned." [...] <b>McCain</b> has <b>said</b> he {{supports}} amending the U.S. Constitution to ban abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother's life.|$|R
25|$|Moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News {{opened the}} debate {{by stating that}} since the first debate, a lot had changed {{in the world and}} for the worse. While Brokaw did not ask the initial questions, he did ask {{follow-up}} ones. When the candidates were asked who they would consider as the next Secretary of the Treasury, John <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that he might concur with Obama's suggestion of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and then went on also to suggest former eBay president Meg Whitman. Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett and said there are also many other qualified Americans. Both candidates said {{that it is important to}} choose as Treasury Secretary someone who earns the trust of the American people. The first 5 questions all were related to the economy.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} {{the president might}} be willing to sign {{a modified version of the}} Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
500|$|On March 16, Senator John McCain accused Paul {{of being}} an agent of Vladimir Putin after Paul objected to adding Montenegro to NATO. Paul responded the {{following}} day by saying McCain [...] "makes a really, really strong case for term limits", suggesting McCain had become [...] "a little unhinged" [...] {{as a result of}} his seniority. On April 7, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he did not pay attention to any of Paul's rhetoric and that the latter did not have [...] "any real influence" [...] in the United States Senate.|$|E
2500|$|<b>McCain</b> also <b>said</b> that Obama had [...] "movingly mourned {{and honored}} the victims", and [...] "encouraged every American who participates in our {{political}} debates - whether {{we are on the}} left or right or in the media - to aspire to a more generous appreciation of one another and a more modest one of ourselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|In early 2008, Rohrabacher {{endorsed}} Mitt Romney in the Republican presidential primary, citing {{his positions}} on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing John McCain. About <b>McCain,</b> he <b>said,</b> [...] "He's been {{the enemy of}} {{those of us who}} have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{evidence}} of her {{claim that the}} Branchflower investigation was [...] "tainted," [...] McCain spokesperson Stapleton cited the removal of former Palin Chief of Staff Tibbles from the subpoena list compiled by Branchflower. Branchflower had requested a subpoena for Tibbles because Tibbles was refusing to cooperate voluntarily. Stapleton said [...] "French's further political involvement was accidentally revealed when the investigator testified that he had deferred to French on the proper witnesses to subpoena." [...] On October 1, the <b>McCain</b> campaign <b>said</b> [...] "Branchflower and French were recently exposed for colluding on the issuing of subpoenas." [...] The <b>McCain</b> campaign also <b>said</b> [...] "in a hearing, Branchflower admits conspiring with French regarding the recipients of subpoenas." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of the committee's findings, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that he and Kerry had convinced the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, {{and that he had}} spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans. [...] McCain's push for normalization was opposed by some leading Senate Republicans, including Phil Gramm and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. [...] In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. [...] McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement gave Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark called Williams' a [...] "sometimes overly {{transparent}} {{effort to}} underscore the grief of the victims' survivors", and said the episode [...] "works overtime" [...] {{to make the world}} seem like a [...] "bleak and scary place". Bark also said the show made itself a [...] "target for charges of racism" [...] by making the three murderers black, but also credited the script with making one of the perpetrators so sympathetic. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said the writers [...] "try a little too hard" [...] to create sympathy for the three murder suspects, and the episode suffers due to the absence of actor Andre Braugher, who plays Detective Frank Pembleton. But Shales also praised Williams' performance and said the episode was particularly powerful because the actual violence is off-screen. Buzz McCain, columnist with The Washington Times, called the episode [...] "irritating" [...] and [...] "as pointless as the killing". He particularly criticized the script, which he said was clichéd and overly [...] "misty-eyed", particularly the extended moments of Williams talking about the shooting. In a later article, <b>McCain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Nothing I've written in this column generated as much visceral response as my nine paragraphs about ("Bop Gun")." [...] In addition to responses from angry fans, McCain received a call from David Mills, who <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> [...] "simply wanted some insight as to what specifically I didn't like about his show and how the writers might improve on the next one." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} {{the day after}} the debate, Wurzelbacher said Obama's tax plan wouldn't affect him right now, because he doesn't make $250,000. He also indicated to reporters that he was a conservative, a fan of the military and <b>McCain.</b> He <b>said</b> meeting <b>McCain</b> would be an honor but said he hadn't been contacted by the Republican campaign.|$|R
5000|$|On October 25, {{news stories}} by Politico and CNN {{reported}} dissension within the campaign. A <b>McCain</b> aide <b>said</b> Palin had [...] "gone rogue", placing her own future political interests {{ahead of the}} McCain/Palin ticket, directly contradicting her running mate's positions and disobeying directions from campaign managers. (A year after the election, Palin would title her memoir after this accusation.) ...|$|R
25|$|Large-scale {{campaign}} staff downsizing {{took place}} in early July, with 50 to 100 staffers let go and others taking pay cuts or switching to no pay. McCain's aides said the campaign was considering taking public matching funds, and would focus its efforts on the early primary and caucus states. <b>McCain</b> however <b>said</b> he was not considering {{dropping out of the}} race.|$|R
500|$|By November 1989, the {{estimated}} cost of the overall {{savings and loan crisis}} had reached $500 billion, and the media's formerly erratic coverage had turned around and become a feeding frenzy. The Lincoln matter was getting large-scale press attention and the senators became commonly known as the [...] "Keating Five". All the senators denied they had done anything improper in the matter, and said Keating's contributions made no difference to their actions. The senators' initial defense of their actions rested on Keating being one of their constituents; <b>McCain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I have done this kind of thing many, many times," [...] and said the Lincoln case was like [...] "helping the little lady who didn't get her Social Security." [...] Some of the five hired high-power Washington lawyers to represent them– including Charles Ruff for Glenn and John Dowd for McCain– while others feared that to do so would give the appearance their political careers were in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> that Republican voters had spoken and {{he would support}} Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{publicly}} {{skeptical about}} the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he {{voted in favor of}} the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, [...] "Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we {{would not be able to}} win because we were demanding something that was not achievable." [...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] <b>McCain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E
25|$|During the campaign's summer 2007 {{financial}} woes, it used a list {{of donors}} as collateral {{in order to get}} approval on a bank loan. This raised {{the question of whether the}} campaign's privacy policy was violated by such a use. A <b>McCain</b> spokesperson <b>said</b> it did not, since all of the campaign's assets were pledged as collateral at the time, not just the donor list.|$|R
50|$|Congress had banned {{such attacks}} from {{being used by}} the {{military}} through the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had sponsored the Act, but opposed the conference committee ban because, he said, it applied military standards to intelligence agencies. <b>McCain</b> also <b>said</b> that waterboarding was forbidden under current law but asked the Bush administration to clarify the matter by declaring it illegal.|$|R
5000|$|John <b>McCain</b> has <b>said</b> of his mother: [...] "My {{mother was}} raised to be a strong, {{determined}} woman who thoroughly enjoyed life, and always {{tried to make the}} most of her opportunities. She was encouraged to accept, graciously and with good humor, the responsibilities and sacrifices her choices have required of her. I am grateful to her for the strengths she taught me by example." ...|$|R
500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] <b>McCain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E
500|$|Keating {{asked that}} Lincoln {{be given a}} lenient {{judgment}} by the FHLBB, so it could limit its high risk investments {{and get into the}} relatively safe home mortgage business, allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. McCain initially refused to meet with Keating over the FHLBB matter and Keating called McCain a [...] "wimp" [...] behind his back. The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he had not spent years in North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended and they would not speak again. In April 1987, the group of senators met twice with FHLBB members who were investigating American Continental Corporation and Lincoln, in an attempt to end the investigation. Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating. In May 1988, the FHLBB agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving Lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point. (In 1991, the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the Senate Ethics Committee, with Cranston receiving the harshest verdict and Glenn and McCain the least. McCain later testified against Keating in a civil lawsuit brought by Lincoln bondholders, while the other four refused to testify.) ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began {{publicly}} questioning North Vietnamese {{treatment of}} U.S. prisoners. [...] On June 5, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any such mistreatment. The broadcast used excerpts from McCain's forced [...] "confession" [...] {{of a year}} before, including a statement where {{he said he had}} bombed [...] "cities, towns and villages" [...] and had received [...] "very good medical treatment" [...] as a prisoner. [...] In late 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved. [...] North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs. [...] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. [...] In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo [...] "Hanoi Hilton"; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. [...] When the prisoners talked about {{what they wanted to do}} once they got out, <b>McCain</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to become President. [...] McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hoa Lo with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist , that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma. McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam, and Barral proclaimed him [...] "an insensitive individual without human depth." [...] The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews, and despite pressure from his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.|$|E
5000|$|On August 30, the <b>McCain</b> {{campaign}} <b>said</b> [...] "Governor Palin is an {{open book}} on this -- she did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide. … she has been happy to cooperate fully in the inquiry of this matter. … The legislature and Attorney General are both currently reviewing the circumstances of Walt Monegan’s departure … and the Governor is fully cooperating with those inquiries." ...|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Senator John <b>McCain</b> (R-AZ) <b>said</b> on the August 11 {{edition of}} Fox News Sunday that Snowden {{had become a}} hero to young Americans, as he {{reminded}} them of the Jason Bourne character. McCain attributed it to generation change {{and a lack of}} confidence in the federal government. [...] "Right now there's kind of a generational change," [...] he said. [...] "Young Americans do not trust this government." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>McCain</b> has <b>said</b> that {{he favors}} {{the concept of}} equal pay (the {{abolition}} of wage differences based on gender). He has, however, opposed specific legislation {{that would have given}} workers more time to discover sex discrimination before bringing suit under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. In 2007, the House of Representatives passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, would have allowed [...] "employees to file charges of pay discrimination within 180 days of the last received paycheck affected by the alleged discriminatory decision." [...] The bill would have overturned the Supreme Court decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear. There the Court dismissed a woman's discrimination claim because she had filed it more than 180 days after the first affected paycheck. <b>McCain,</b> who <b>said</b> he opposed the bill, was campaigning in New Orleans, Louisiana {{at the time of the}} Senate vote in 2008, when the bill died because Democrats could not break a Republican filibuster (The vote in favor of the bill was 56–42, with 60 needed for cloture).|$|R
