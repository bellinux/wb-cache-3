Measurements stations were installed on mine accesses to monitor mine gas parameters (oxygen, carbon dioxide and methane volumetric content, radon volumetric activity, flow velocity, gas temperature and differential pressure) and external parameters (temperature and barometric pressure).

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} reservoir stimulating {{technologies are}} only applicable to hard coal but helpless for soft coal, {{which is one}} of the main factors hindering the CBM industrialization in China. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a universal stimulating technology which can increase the permeability in various coal reservoirs. Theoretical analysis and field tests were used to systematically analyze the mechanical mechanisms causing the formation of various levels and types of fractures, such as radial tensile fractures, peripheral tensile fractures, and shear fractures in hydraulic fracturing, and reveal the mechanism of permeability enhancement by fracture network stimulating in surrounding beds and coal reservoirs. The results show that multi-staged perforation fracturing of horizontal wells, hydraulic-jet staged fracturing, four-variation hydraulic fracturing and some auxiliary measures are effective technical approaches to fracture network stimulation, especially the four-variation hydraulic fracturing can stimulate the fracture network in vertical and cluster wells. It is concluded that the fracture network stimulating technology for surrounding beds has significant advantages, such as safe drilling operation, strong stimulation effect, strong adaptability to stress-sensitive and velocity-sensitive beds, and is suitable for coal reservoirs of any structure. Except for the limitation in extremely water-sensitive and high water-yield surrounding beds, the technology can be universally used in all other beds. The successful industrial tests in surface coal bed methane and underground coal <b>mines</b> <b>gas</b> extraction prove that the theory and technical system of fracture network stimulating in surrounding beds and coal reservoirs, as a universally applicable measure, will play a role in the CBM development in China...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from natural}} gas {{there is another}} {{important}} natural source of methane. The so-called coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> is a by-product of the geochemical process of the carbonization of sediments from marsh woods of the Earth's Carboniferous Period. Methane evaporates from the coal {{and has to be}} removed out of the active mines where it represents one of the main safety risks. Methane also evaporates in abandoned coal mines. In the federal state Saarland in Germany exists above ground a more than 110 km pipeline for the drained coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> from 12 different sources. The content of methane varies between 25 and 90 %, the oxygen content (from air) is in the range up to 10 %. This wide range or variation, respectively, of fuel and oxygen content, causes a lot of problems for the use in conventional engines. Therefore the company Evonik New Energies GmbH is interested in using SOFC with coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> as efficient as possible to produce electric power. For that purpose at Forschungszentrum Julich the available SOFC technology was adapted to the use with coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> and a test facility was designed to operate an SOFC stack (approximately 2 kW electrical power output) together with a pre-reformer. This paper presents the results of the coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> analysis and the effect on the pre-reformer and the fuel cell. The composition of the coal <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> was determined by means of micro-gas chromatography.

The paper primarily discussed the character of <b>gas</b> explosion under <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> and spontaneous combustion coupling.

When the spontaneous combustion of coal occurs, it can produce plenty of CO and fire-heating air pressure in the goaf. Experiments show that the upper limit of explosion concentration rises rapidly and the lower limit rises slowly with the increase of CO in the mixed gas of CH 4 and CO. The fire-heating air pressure results in continuous mix of the gases and heat convection under vortex action between the combustion zone and non-firing zone. Thus, gas explosion occurs.
