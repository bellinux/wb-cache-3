25|$|Little Feat's album Dixie Chicken {{was first}} {{released}} in 1973. Haeny mixed {{a large portion}} of Dixie Chicken. The third studio album was considered a landmark album with the title track as their signature song that helped further define the Little Feat sound. A year later in 1974, Haeny also worked on the engineering of Little Feat's fourth studio album, Feats Don’t Fail <b>Me</b> <b>Now.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{real world}} is persistent. The game {{world of a}} {{pervasive}} game {{takes place in the}} real world and so pervasive games are also persistent. In other words, pervasive games shared the persistence trait with virtual worlds. An example of a pervasive game that makes heavy use of a virtual world is Can You See <b>Me</b> <b>Now?,</b> where street runners exist in a virtual world while simultaneously running around the real physical world; the game was persistent during play, as well as the virtual world.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the success}} of the single, a full album was commissioned, and This Is <b>Me</b> <b>Now</b> was {{released}} in May 2005. The album sold more than 150,000 copies, which was triple the requirement for gold record certification in Sweden at the time. The success led to television appearances, such as on the weekly chart show Trackslistan and on the children's competition show Vi i femman. By the end of 2005, she had appeared live on more than 20 television shows. A concert tour in Sweden was organized for her in the summer, and some of the shows were also televised.|$|E

25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
25|$|In his 1997 {{submission}} to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, General Malan described the CCB as follows:"15.1 Let <b>me</b> <b>now</b> {{deal with the}} matter of the CCB. The CCB-organisation as a component of Special Forces was approved in principle by me. Special Forces was an integral and supportive part of the South African Defence Force. The role envisaged for the CCB was the infiltration and penetration of the enemy, the gathering of information and the disruption of the enemy. The CCB was approved as an organisation consisting of ten divisions, or as expressed in military jargon, regions. Eight of these divisions or regions were intended to refer to geographical areas. The area of one of these regions, Region Six, referred to the Republic of South Africa. The fact that the organisation in Region Six was activated, came to my knowledge {{for the first time in}} November 1989. The CCB provided the South African Defence Force with good covert capabilities.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{is written}} as a self-manifesto song. Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career. The lyrics explain {{that she does not}} want to retire from her career at that moment and possesses the ability to continue, as noted in the lines [...] "Don't stop <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> no need to catch my breath, I can {{go on and on and}} on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think most}} of the time when my records come out, people are so much distracted by so much fanfare and {{controversy}} that nobody pays attention to the music. [...] I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is to <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, {{but it was just}} an accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold <b>me</b> <b>Now,</b> Part 2" [...] and harassing you to try and find a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E

500|$|Baltimore {{spent the}} last two years of his life {{constantly}} lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by William Claiborne, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the Chesapeake, claiming they possessed the rights to that area. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: [...] "Blessed be God for it who hath preserved <b>me</b> <b>now</b> from shipwreck, hunger, scurvy and pestilence..." ...|$|E

She stated: [...] "I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart. If the world was gonna hear it, I wanted them to hear it right... It's as good as gone to <b>me</b> <b>now...</b> The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie... sad." [...] Gordon did note that she was dissatisfied with the circumstances, but was in [...] "no way dissing Lopez." ...|$|E
