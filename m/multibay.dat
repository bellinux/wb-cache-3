50|$|Later {{versions}} of the PS2 Linux kit use an interface {{very similar to the}} HDD interface/Ethernet sold later for network play (the later released Network adaptor was also usable with the kit, including the built-in 56k modem.) This kit locates the hard drive internal to the PS2, in the <b>MultiBay.</b> With this kit, only the SCPH-30000 model of PlayStation 2 is officially supported. The kit does though work equally well with models newer than SCPH-30000 with the exception that the Ethernet connection tended to freeze after a short period of use. Thus the newer SCPH-50000 PlayStation 2 model will only work correctly with PS2 Linux with an updated network adapter driver, which must be transferred to the PlayStation 2 HDD by using either an older model PlayStation 2 to transfer the driver or a Linux PC with an IDE port. Both methods involve swapping HDDs. This is due to the inability to use USB Mass Storage devices with the relatively old kernel (version 2.2.1) shipped with the kit.|$|E

Comparisons are made between single-bay and double-bay finite element (FE) models (where "bay" denotes a repeating portion, between supports, in the load/length direction) and a new strut model, following a Shanley-type approach, for single-bay and <b>multibay</b> panels. The strut model has been incorporated within the strip program VIPASA with CONstraints and OPTimization (VICONOPT) to design a <b>multibay</b> example panel with postbuckling reserve of strength in its skins, assuming linear elastic material properties. The panel has been shown by VICONOPT to have a stiffener buckling failure mode when an overall sinusoidal imperfection causing increased stiffener compression is present. The failure is confirmed by the double-bay FE model, which is shown to be an imperfect representation of the <b>multibay</b> case. Single-bay analysis using the strut model shows good agreement with the single-bay FE results. The VICONOPT code is able to design a metallic panel of realistic dimensions and loading using 50 strip elements (compared with the 9600 shell elements required by the finite element model) but cannot correctly account for material nonlinearity.

40|$|The {{bending failure}} in {{reinforced}} concrete beams and frames under static {{as well as}} dynamic loading is typically caused by localiza-tion of cracking into inelastic hinges. This phenomenon, which is of greatest concern for high-strength concrete because of its higJa brittleness, has a profound destabilizing effect under both static and dynamic conditions. The paper analyzes the behavior at typi-cal static bifurcations with localization for a single column, a portal frame, and a <b>multibay</b> frame. Under dynamic loading near the state of static bifurcation or near the static limit point, the primary (sym-metric) path of dynamic response {{as well as the}} periodic response becomes dynamically unstable in the sense of Lyapunov. The impli-cation for seismic loading is that the kinetic energy of the structure must be absorbed by fewer hinges, which means faster collapse. The dynamic localizations are demonstrated by semi-analytical solution of horizontal shear excitation of a building column. Regarding the current practice, {{it is important to note}} that the usual simplifica-tion of a structure as a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator becomes inapplicable after the static bifurcation state is passed. 1397...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyzes}} dynamic localization {{of damage}} in structures with softening inelastic hinges and studies {{implications for the}} seismic response of reinforced concrete or steel frames of buildings or bridges. First, the theory of limit points and bifurcation of the symmetric eqUilibrium path due to localization of softening damage is reviewed. It is proven that, near the state of static bifurcation or near the static limit point, the primary (symmetric) path of dynamic response or periodic response temporarily develops Liapunov-type dynamic insta-bility such that imperfections representing deviations from the primary path grow exponentially or linearly while damage in the frame localizes into fewer softening hinges. The implication for seismic loading is that the kinetic energy of the structure must be absorbed by fewer hinges, which means faster collapse. The dynamic localizations are demonstrated by exact analytical solutions of torsional rotation of {{the floor of a}} symmetric and symmetrically excited frame, and of horizontal shear excitation of a building column. Static bifurcations with localization are also demonstrated for a portal frame, a <b>multibay</b> frame, and a multibay-multistory frame. The widely used simplification of a structure as a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator becomes invalid after the static bifurcation state is passed...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} flexibility of engineering structures, transient and residual vibrations occur when a motion command is applied, thus raising several practical restrictions concerning their fast, accurate and safe motion. Although various command-preconditioning techniques {{have been proposed}} for the effective suppression of the excited vibrations, their application has been limited only to structures with a few distinct and well-separated modes. This paper further considers the applicability of motion preconditioning methods for a large class of lightweight flexible structures, which present multiple densely spaced natural modes, existing even at relatively low frequencies. Properly designed finite impulse response (FIR) filters can lead to an effective motion preconditioning method, suppressing drastically the excited vibrations over the entire excited frequency band. Compared to other alternative preconditioning methods, such as input shapers or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, FIR filters present the most efficient behavior in terms of vibration suppression efficiency, or {{in terms of the}} delay introduced in the motion command, as verified by numerical simulations and experimental results involving <b>multibay</b> trusses, with tenths of densely spaced modes in a range from 0. 4 Hz up to 75 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the interim progress for an in-house study that {{is directed toward}} innovative structural analysis and design of next-generation advanced aircraft concepts, such as the Hybrid Wing-Body (HWB) and the Advanced Mobility Concept-X flight vehicles, for structural weight reduction and associated performance enhancement. Unlike the conventional, skin-stringer-frame construction for a cylindrical fuselage, the box-type pressurized fuselage panels in the HWB undergo significant deformation of the outer aerodynamic surfaces, which must be minimized without significant structural weight penalty. Simple beam and orthotropic plate theory is first considered for sizing, analytical verification, and possible equivalent-plate analysis with appropriate simplification. By designing advanced composite stiffened-shell configurations, significant weight reduction may be possible compared with the sandwich and ribbed-shell structural concepts that have been studied previously. The study involves independent analysis of the advanced composite structural concepts that are presently being developed by The Boeing Company for pressurized HWB flight vehicles. High-fidelity parametric finite-element models of test coupons, panels, and <b>multibay</b> fuselage sections, were developed for conducting design studies and identifying critical areas of potential failure.

40|$|Structural {{integrity}} {{assessment of}} aging flight vehicles {{is extremely important}} to ensure their economic and safe operation. A two-step analytical approach, developed to estimate the residual strength of pressurized fuselage stiffened shell panels with multi-bay fatigue cracking is presented in this article. Conventional finite element analysis of the damaged <b>multibay</b> panel is first carried out to obtain the load flow pattern through it. The Schwartz-Neumann alternating method is then applied to the fuselage skin with mutiple site damage, to obtain stresses and the relevant crack tip parameters that govern the onset of fracture. Fracture mechanics as well as net section yield criteria are {{used to evaluate the}} static residual strength. The presence of holes with or without multisite damage ahead of a dominant crack is found to significantly degrade the capacity of the fuselage shell panels to sustain static internal pressure. An elastic-plastic alternating method is newly developed and applied to evaluate the residual strength of flat panels with multiple cracks. The computational methodologies presented herein are marked improvements to the present state-of-the-art, and are extremely efficient, both from engi-neering manpower as well as computational costs point of view. Once verified, they can very well complement the experimental requirements, reducing the cost of structural integrity assessment programs...|$|E
