5|$|J. R. Miller, relying <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Pflueger's {{hard-working}} energy, social conviviality {{and artistic}} talent, {{gave him a}} wide variety of assignments including designs for an automobile showroom, a firehouse and a number of private homes. Pflueger extended his proposed styles to include Aztec elements and Spanish Colonial Revival themes, the latter favored by several clients for their homes.|$|E
5|$|Victoria came {{to depend}} <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his support and guidance. He aided the {{development}} of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament—although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary. In 1857, {{he was given the}} formal title of Prince Consort.|$|E
5|$|When {{the forms}} of {{traditional}} power come to an end, there {{tends to be a}} corresponding change in creeds. If the traditional creeds are doubted without any alternative, then the traditional authority relies <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the use of naked power. And where the traditional creeds are wholly replaced with alternative ones, traditional power gives rise to revolutionary power (Russell 1938:82).|$|E

50|$|In 1346, Dalmatia {{was struck}} by the Black Death. The {{economic}} situation was also poor, <b>and</b> the cities became <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> dependent <b>on</b> Venice.|$|R
5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|Preoccupied with {{military}} matters and {{spending most of}} his time at his military headquarters on the eastern front, Hitler came to rely <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Bormann to handle the domestic policies of the country. On 12 April 1943, Hitler officially appointed Bormann as Personal Secretary to the Führer. By this time Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters, and this new appointment gave him the power to act in an official capacity in any matter.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{embedded}} systems have been widely infiltrated into our daily lives. Prominent examples are cellular phones, personal digital assistants, digital television set-top boxes, web-pads, and mp 3 players. New kinds of embedded devices are being introduced continually for various purposes. Embedded systems have different combinations and prioritizations of objectives and constraints for their proper design. With the increasing complexity in application functionality, implementation constraints, <b>and</b> optimization objectives, <b>more</b> effective techniques for modeling embedded applications, and for systematically synthesizing implementations become <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> desirable <b>on</b> one hand, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> challenging <b>on</b> the other...|$|R
5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 {{billion worth of}} military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government {{announced that it would}} reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
25|$|Questions about Gertrude {{and other}} minor {{characters}} were later taken underwing by the feminist criticism movement, as criticism focused <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> questions {{of gender and}} political import. Current, New Historicist theories now attempt to remove the romanticism surrounding the play and show its context {{in the world of}} Elizabethan England.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} from Indonesia in 1971, Ras worked in the Department in Leiden. He {{concentrated}} <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Javanese and as associate of Professor Uhlenbeck took over part of the latter’s teaching load. When Uhlenbeck went into retirement, Ras was the obvious person to succeed him, So he was appointed professor of Javanese language and literature in 1985.|$|E
50|$|After 1863, {{although}} Dickens {{continued to}} micromanage the editorial department, scrupulously revising copy, his own contributions fell off considerably, largely because he spent <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> time <b>on</b> {{the road with}} his public readings.|$|R
50|$|Recently, Changzhou’s {{planning}} bureau has put <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> emphasis <b>on</b> {{the protection}} of Qingguo Lane. The bureau has finished the scheme of the protection, which is respond to Qingguo Lane’s historical cultural street.|$|R
50|$|Maserati {{retired from}} factory racing {{participation}} {{because of the}} Guidizzolo tragedy during the 1957 Mille Miglia, though they continued to build cars for privateers. Maserati became <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> focused <b>on</b> building road-going grand tourers.|$|R
25|$|Weston {{continued}} {{to turn out}} prodigious amounts of artwork. With a small family surrounding him, he focused <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the everyday: A quilt, plants in the garden, snowshoes. His work was displayed at the Phillips Memorial Gallery, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art. His painting Green Hat won third prize in painting at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} the Modi government {{made it clear that}} India would focus <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> improving relation with ASEAN and other East Asian countries as per India's Look East Policy which was formulated during Narasimha Rao's government in 1992 for better economic engagement with its eastern neighbours, but the following government successfully turned it into a tool for forging strategic partnership and security cooperation with countries in that region in general and Vietnam and Japan in particular.|$|E
25|$|He loved celebrities, so {{he painted}} them as well. From these {{beginnings}} he developed his later style and subjects. Instead {{of working on}} a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At {{the height of his}} fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.|$|E
50|$|However, {{national}} policy became <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> driven <b>on</b> expansion <b>and</b> developing internal markets and infrastructure. With such changes, the South perceived <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> risks to its position and Calhoun {{became the most}} strident spokesman for sectionalism of his region.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, Lucas Konk West was {{releasing}} <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> tunes <b>on</b> different labels from Stickman records, Acquarius Recordings, F Communications, and many others; {{this increase in}} popularity led him to release under his very own imprint.|$|R

25|$|During {{his second}} reading speech, then-Premier of Tasmania David Bartlett said the take-up rates were 'a good early result'; however, {{he said it}} was 'important to {{increase}} the participation rate'. In his closing remarks, Bartlett said ' NBN in Tasmania is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create jobs and contribute to a new economic direction'. In her second reading speech on behalf of the Tasmanian Opposition, Elise Archer said 'the NBN is an important infrastructure', but that 'the State Liberals have some concern that the NBN business model seems to rely <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> eliminating competition and other technologies'.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz also {{continued}} to intertwine {{the walls of}} his galleries with the pages of his magazine. Stieglitz’s closest friends (Steichen, Demachy, White, Käsebier and Keiley) were represented in both, while many others were granted one but not the other. Increasingly, a single photographer was given the preponderance of coverage in an issue, and in doing so Stieglitz relied <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his small circle of old supporters. This led to increase tensions among Stieglitz and some of his original colleagues, and when Stieglitz began to introduce paintings, drawings and other art forms in his gallery many photographers saw it as the breaking point in their relationship with Stieglitz.|$|E
25|$|In {{his last}} years Ford was dogged by declining health, largely {{the result of}} decades of heavy {{drinking}} and smoking, and exacerbated by the wounds he suffered during the Battle of Midway. His vision in particular began to deteriorate rapidly {{and at one point}} he briefly lost his sight entirely; his prodigious memory also began to falter, making it necessary to rely <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> assistants. His work was also restricted by the new regime in Hollywood, and he found it hard to get many projects made. By the 1960s he had been pigeonholed as a Western director and complained that he now found it almost impossible to get backing for projects in other genres.|$|E
25|$|These {{bottlenecks}} {{particularly in}} the food supply during the First World War broke out in agricultural research, big changes.

25|$|By 1840, the Institute was {{established}} with 1,000 subscribers and {{a library of}} some 5,500 books. However, the increased popularity had been somewhat {{at the cost of}} science education, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> lectures <b>on</b> non-scientific subjects were occupying its programmes.|$|R
50|$|Manmingongdongheo {{was first}} held on 1896. On March 10, 1897, criticizing an {{intervention}} of Russia. Ten thousand Seoul citizens attended the congress. Within ten days, the Korean Empire government agreed {{the decisions of}} Manmingongdonghoe and Russia conceded to Korean order. The congress grew <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> insisted <b>on</b> various rights of people and protection of concessions from the great Powers.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, {{a smaller}} {{renumbering}} of state highways occurred. The renumbering produced some new highways and either realigned or removed highways from the system. In 1996, Sound Transit was formed {{and in the}} same year, the Washington State Transportation Commission adopted its first 20-year transportation plan. Throughout the 1990s, WSDOT focused <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> rail systems and partnered with Amtrak to make a train route that went from Canada to Oregon, which would later become the Amtrak Cascades. The 2001 Nisqually earthquake damaged most state highways around the Seattle metropolitan area and most of the budget was turned over to the Puget Sound region to help rebuild and repair roads and bridges.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century a {{significant}} amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial Royal Navy Dockyard serving the fleet in the Caribbean. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent Port Admiral's (later Commodore's) House included a watch tower, to counter the threat of privateers. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of steam-powered vessels: the victualling wharf became a coaling depot in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built. The Yard continued to expand through {{to the beginning of the}} 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the situation in Europe) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905.|$|E
500|$|In {{a feature}} film The Player (produced in December 1970, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana), Wanderone played himself as [...] "Minnesota Fats" [...] and was {{featured}} prominently on the promotional poster. The screenplay was {{written and directed by}} Thomas DeMartini, also starred pool pro Jack Colavita, and had a limited release in 1971 by International Cinema. That same year Wanderone was a guest on both The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (September 21, 1971), on which he hustled Carson out of US$1, and the British David Frost Show (October 13, 1971). His fame as [...] "Fats" [...] had already made it difficult for Wanderone to hustle effectively, so he relied <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> exhibition games for income.|$|E

50|$|The Bulgarian media {{panorama}} is pluralistic, although {{media outlets}} remain {{influenced by the}} political and economic interests of their owners and main advertisers.
