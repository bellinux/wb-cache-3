5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family {{did not believe that}} Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not be}} substantiating the requested amount, as no <b>money</b> <b>could</b> replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be made {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, {{but this time}} was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> {{not be used for}} margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did, nearly--" [...] said Lady Laura; [...] "very nearly. You told me {{just now}} that you had <b>money,</b> and <b>could</b> {{therefore}} do as you pleased. I had no <b>money,</b> and <b>could</b> not do as I pleased." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Treasury's {{withdrawal}} of funding, in May 1898 the churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate brokered a compromise with the CPF. The disputed site was split into two parts, each priced at £6,000. The western section would be purchased immediately using £6,000 of the £7,000 already raised, with an option to purchase the eastern section if the remaining £5,000 could be raised within two years, after which the CPF would go ahead with building plans if the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> not be raised.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Third class {{passengers}} were {{a diverse group}} of nationalities and ethnic groups. In addition to large numbers of British, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants, there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East (primarily Lebanon and Syria) and Hong Kong. Some travelled alone or in small family groups. Several groups of mothers were travelling alone with their young children—most going to join their husbands who had already gone to America to find jobs, and, having saved up enough <b>money,</b> <b>could</b> now send for their families.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd-century crisis {{started a}} chain-reaction of {{socio-economic}} effects that proved decisive {{for the development}} of the late army. The combination of barbarian devastation and reduced tax-base due to plague bankrupted the imperial government, which resorted to issuing ever more debased coin e.g. the antoninianus, the silver coin used to pay the troops in this period, lost 95% of its silver content between its launch in 215 and its demise in the 260s. Thus 20 times more <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be distributed with the same amount of precious metal. This led to rampant price inflation: for example, the price of wheat under Diocletian was 67 times the typical price under the Principate. The monetary economy collapsed and the army was obliged to rely on unpaid food levies to obtain supplies. Food levies were raised without regard to fairness, ruining the border provinces where the military was mainly based. Soldiers' salaries became worthless, which reduced the army's recruits to a subsistence-level existence. This in turn discouraged volunteers and forced the government to rely on conscription and large-scale recruitment of barbarians into the regular army because of the shortfalls caused by the plague. By the mid-4th century, barbarian-born men probably accounted for about a quarter of all recruits (and over a third in elite regiments), likely a far higher share than in the 1st and 2nd centuries.|$|E
25|$|Following United States President Bill Clinton's administration's {{aggressive}} financial deregulation {{campaign in}} the 1990s, globalisation leaders overturned longstanding restrictions by governments that limited foreign ownership of their banks, deregulated currency exchange, and eliminated restrictions on how quickly <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be withdrawn by foreign investors.|$|E
25|$|Survival became {{increasingly}} hard with reduced rations {{and lack of}} fuel. Death rates rose as the occupation progressed. Those with <b>money</b> <b>could</b> supplement their diet with black market produce. Islanders were saved from starvation {{with the arrival of}} the SS Vega, bringing Red Cross parcels during the winter of 1944–1945.|$|E

50|$|In May 2017, {{an audit}} by Arizona's Clean Elections Commission, found that Rubalcava spent $9,200 in {{publicly}} funded campaign <b>money</b> that <b>could</b> {{not be determined}} as campaign related.|$|R
25|$|After {{spending}} a few months working for his father-in-law as a trainee mechanic, Ryan decided that more <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be made cutting timber near Marysville and Licola. When it was too wet to cut timber, Ryan got a job painting for the State Electricity Commission. By 1952 the Ryan family was living in Noojee.|$|E
25|$|Siegel began a {{spending}} spree. He demanded the finest building that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> buy {{at a time}} of postwar shortages. As costs soared, his checks began bouncing. By October 1946, the costs were above $4million. By 1947, the Flamingo's cost was over $6million ($ million today). By late November of that year, the work was nearly finished.|$|E
25|$|All women together, {{ought to}} let flowers fall upon {{the grave of}} Aphra Behn... for {{it was she who}} earned them the right to speak their minds... Behn proved that <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be made by writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain {{agreeable}} qualities; and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a distracted mind but was of practical importance.|$|E

50|$|Under the Leonard Foundation terms, boursaries {{were made}} {{available}} to students who were white, British subjects, and Protestant {{and no more than}} one-quarter of the <b>moneys</b> <b>could</b> be awarded to females. The goal was to provide financial assistance to needy students who showed the promise of becoming leading citizens of the British Empire. A complaint filed against the Leonard Foundation under the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1986 prompted litigation. The Ontario Court of Appeal held in 1990, that the trust’s exclusionary terms relating to race, religion, nationality, and gender were contrary to law.|$|R

25|$|In 1859, one of Roach's closest friends, {{a lawyer}} named John Baker, died and left Roach the trustee of his estate. The estate, worth $70,000, was {{entrusted}} to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> not be claimed until 1881, {{it was as}} good as a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon {{to take advantage of it}} to expand his business.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} the NSF {{division}} of Astronomical Sciences, made public on November 3, 2006, recommended substantially decreased astronomy funding for the Arecibo Observatory, from $10.5 million in 2007 to $4.0 million in 2011. If other sources of <b>money</b> <b>could</b> not be obtained, the observatory {{would be forced to}} close. The report also advised that 80 percent of observing time be allocated to the surveys already in progress, reducing available time for smaller programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{work has}} come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the {{fanaticism}} of the Taliban, while NPR reported that others believe the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be better spent on housing and electricity for the region. Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.|$|E

25|$|In late 1975 and 1976, {{the newly}} hired sales manager Stewart Halstead {{was charged with}} the task of {{expanding}} the home and European markets to stabilize TVR's future. Enthusiasm for the cars was high in the US, tempered {{by the fact that the}} cars' pricing had crept up over recent years to the point where the same <b>money</b> <b>could</b> buy a new Corvette. Opportunities continued to expand in Europe, where dealerships opened in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the tour came from William Pickering, a former player who had emigrated to Canada in 1852 and first captained Canada against the United States the {{following}} year. Together with Robert Waller from St George's Cricket Club, Pickering opened discussions for a possible tour in 1856 but financial problems meant that it was three years before the <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be raised. The English team required a guarantee of £600, which Pickering obtained through the Montreal Cricket Club, Hamilton Cricket Club and St George's Cricket Club.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{rejected}} the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of {{audience in the}} High Court The report concluded {{that the practice of}} law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, because without independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional self-regulation through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see if time and <b>money</b> <b>could</b> be saved for the parties involved.|$|E
