25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult questions arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>home</b> in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E

2500|$|Chi is the {{personal}} {{spirit of a}} person ḿmúọ́, in Igbo culture it is this spirit which determines destiny. Hence the saying, onye kwe, Chi ya ekwe ("If a person agrees to a thing, his spirit agrees also"). Culturally, people are seen as the creators or makers of their own destiny. The breath of life is in the heart, óbì. Chi refers to {{the light and the}} day in contrast to the dark. The universal chi indirectly in charge of everything is Chukwu who is the supreme being that is beyond the limits of time and space. Chukwu's name is a compound of the words chí + úkwú ('great in size, supreme'). Chi is believed to be a spiritual connection between an individual and the high god and it dictates the trajectory of a person's spiritual journey on earth. Each chi is personal and is in communion with and inseparable from the universal chi of all things. The high god, Chukwu, is believed to assign chi before and at the time of an individuals birth. It is a guardian spirit providing care, guardianship, and providence, in this respect, the concept of chi is analogous to the concept of a guardian angel in Christianity, the daemon in ancient Greek religion, and the genius in ancient Roman religion. Unlike Chukwu who is genderless, chi can be masculine. A dibia can identify a person’s chi through divination (áfà) and advices adherents of ways to placate it. Chukwu is also referred to as Chineke which is a compound of the words chí the divine masculine force and ékè the creative and divisive feminine force. Eke came {{out of the hands of}} Chi but are considered one; Chi created the world while Eke divided it incorporating a divisive trickster energy that introduced death and suffering. Chineke is also interpreted as chí ne ké, 'chi the creatrix', and chí nne éké, 'chi the creative mother'. Eke is ones ancestral guardian spirit. Chineke or Chukwu is high up away at the periphery of human life and remains a mystery to the people. [...] Households usually contain a chi shrine which could be focused on a tree. In marriage a woman takes her chi shrine along with all her belongings to her <b>matrimonial</b> <b>home.</b> Around Nkarahia, in southern Igboland, there are the most elaborate chi shrines which are decorated with colourful china plates inset into the clay walls of the chi shrine building; the altars hold sacred emblems, while the polished mud benches hold offerings of china, glass, manillas, and food. As a marker of personal fortune or misfortune, good acts or ill, chi can be described as a focal point for 'personal religion'.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} unique legal issues {{surrounding}} polygamous marriage and divorce in mainland Tanzania, and submits that the Law of Marriage Act of 1971 (LMA) should be amended {{to include a}} provision that governs co-wives’ property interests {{in the case of}} divorce. Moreover, it proposes awareness-raising efforts to increase legal literacy and to promote the rights of co-wives. Under Section 10 (1) of the Act, a marriage is defined as “the voluntary union {{of a man and a}} woman, intended to last for their joint lives,” and may either be monogamous or polygamous (or potentially polygamous). Further, under Section 57, no wife in a polygamous marriage holds a superior position in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>homes</b> than any other wife. Effectively, under the LMA all co-wives have equal rights and obligations while they are married. But what about after a divorce? Although a plain reading of Section 57 could logically extend equal rights and obligations to co-wives upon divorce, Tanzanian courts have not interpreted it this way. In Maryam Mbaraka Saleh v. Abood Saleh Abood, a senior co-wife was unsuccessful in reopening divorce proceedings concerning her husband and a former co-wife. Previously, the ex-wife had won her case before the Court of Appeal, which held that she was entitled to forty percent of the marital property, based on her contribution. The fact that the husband was engaged in a polygamous marriage was never raised until the remaining co-wife sought to secure her share of the assets. The Court of Appeal declined her request for relief because she was not a party to the original divorce proceedings. Thus, although the LMA contemplates both monogamous and polygamous marriage, it only appears to contemplate the divorce of monogamous couples. Because non-divorcing co-wives cannot be a party to divorce proceedings, and only parties can claim a stake in marital assets, the LMA currently offers no means for non-divorcing co-wives to claim a stake in marital property. This Article argues that the LMA fails to protect the property rights of all co-wives upon divorce, and that reform is imperative as Tanzanian divorce rates increase. Numerous articles have been written about succession and property rights relating to marriage in Tanzania, but no scholarship specifically examines these rights within the context of a polygamous marriage, which account for approximately one fourth of all Tanzanian marriages. To the extent that divorce is on the rise in Tanzania, this issue is both timely and consequential...|$|R
40|$|In {{a patriarchal}} society, women {{are faced with}} all sorts of {{dehumanisation}} ranging from deprivation, negligence, maltreatment, marginalisation, oppression, subjugation, exploitation, humiliation and even isolation, all of which emanate from aspects of the people’s culture. As a result, women now cry out for such aspects of the culture that undermine their wellbeing and emancipation to be eradicated. They, therefore, struggle for equality and emancipation in the male dominated society, especially the African society under study here. In this direction, literature becomes a tool for them to create awareness that the modern African woman through educational attainments is not just fighting for rights and privileges but also for something that must let the society understand that the women demand equal opportunities as human beings. Literature has, therefore, become a tool used to reflect the harsh realities of human lives, especially by the female writers like Ngozi Chuma-Udeh and some others concerning the socio-political, economic and religious realities of the womenfolk. Since literature has been found a veritable source of inspiration for national consciousness, it has become part of human life and existence, offering light, giving meaning and interpretation to man and his society as he struggles and aspires for a desired and cherished future. In the African society, for instance, women are seen not heard. They live under the shadows of men form their maiden <b>homes</b> to their <b>matrimonial</b> <b>homes</b> hence, they are regarded as second class citizens. They are usually neglected as their opinions are never sought before decisions are taken even in matters that directly affect them. In marriage, proposals are made to their fathers, or other male members of the family in the event of the father’s death. In fact, in the African society, which is under study here, women are seen as mere tools of necessity-housewives, child bearers, gratifiers of men’s sexual passion; and worst of all, not consulted in the decision making processes in their communities. The women as wives are expected to be submissive, obedient, unquestioning and servile while any challenge to these attributes attracts social disfavour. So the clearly defined roles for women are passed on to the girl-child as she grows. As soon as she is able to do things for herself, she starts assuming the roles society has mapped out for her: learning how to cook, care for the home, helping with everything else the mother does, and preparing for womanhood and matrimony. This paper, therefore, takes a critical look into Ngozi Chuma-Udeh’s novel that advocates a new dawn for the women. The novelist wants the men to reconsider their negative notions about women and to also appreciate their contributions in the well-being of their societies, their families and the upbringing of the children...|$|R
