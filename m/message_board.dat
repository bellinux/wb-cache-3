On February 18, 2009, Down {{was announced}} in the lineup for the 2009 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Following these live dates, the band toured the USA and Canada during August and September 2009. On March 30, 2009, Down posted a statement on their <b>message</b> <b>board</b> indicating {{that they will be}} back in the studio from October through November writing and recording what will eventually become Down IV. In the summer of 2009, Down began a US tour without Rex on bass, who had developed acute pancreatitis.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see thoughts in different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing {{different types of}} thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} spending money on in-game items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A <b>message</b> <b>board</b> in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with the buying and selling of various in-game items.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{main hub}} is the Comet Observatory, a {{spaceship}} which contains six themed domes that {{provide access to}} the 42 galaxies available in the game. Five of the domes end with a boss level in which {{the objective is to}} defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr., which then gives the player access to the next dome via acquiring a collectable called a Grand Star. The player only has access to a few galaxies when they begin the game; as more Power Stars are collected, more galaxies become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as Luigi after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power Stars are collected with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge for Mario and Luigi to complete, which upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative pictures that can be sent to the Wii <b>Message</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, it was {{announced}} Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain, and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine, was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. Jude Law (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a <b>message</b> <b>board</b> as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director {{he did not think}} the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again.|$|E

25|$|The site at {{one time}} had an {{extensive}} message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, {{with a large number}} of regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls and malicious code-hackers, who vandalized the forum substantially. The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited <b>message</b> <b>board</b> community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new <b>message</b> <b>board</b> section once again, then deleted it in April 2010.|$|E
