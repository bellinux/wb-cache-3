40|$|A <b>controlled</b> <b>{{language}}</b> is {{a subset}} of a natural language with artificially restricted vocabulary, grammar, and style. Texts written in a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> are usually less complex and less ambiguous than those written in an uncontrolled language. The use of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> therefore produces better results in machine translation. On the other hand, a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> reduces the power of expression and decreases the writing speed. In short, a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> brings out the maximum performance of machine translation systems {{at the cost of}} the burden on source text authors.

40|$|We {{present a}} <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> checker for Greek {{that has been}} {{implemented}} using Ellogon, a generic text engineering platform. A <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> is a language with a restricted syntax, vocabulary and terminology that is typically applied to technical documents. The aim of using <b>controlled</b> <b>languages</b> in technical documentation is the production of texts with simple structure and restricted vocabulary that can be read and translated easier (Eijk, 1998; Vouros et al. 1997). Several software companies (e. g. Bull, IBM) {{as well as other}} companies (e. g. Caterpillar, General Motors, Boeing) are already using <b>controlled</b> <b>languages</b> during technical writing of their products. The restrictions imposed by the use of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> help to preserve uniformity in the writing style, especially in cases where authors tend to follow diverse writing approaches, and to reduce ambiguities in the resulting text. Using a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> makes translation more efficient and improves the quality of the translated version. <b>Controlled</b> <b>language</b> can also facilitate machine translation systems since the resources provided for the <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> (vocabulary, terminology and syntax rules) can be embedded into the machine translation system, improving its performance.

Although 2 ̆ 2 steady state operation (SSO) 2 ̆ 2 is an indispensable prerequisite for a reactor, the immediate goal of ITER is 400 seconds.

The present study is aimed at clarifying the particle circulation in three systems, core, boundary, and first wall.
