50|$|<b>Mebanazine</b> (trade name Actomol) is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI) of the hydrazine chemical class that was previously {{used as an}} antidepressant in the 1960s, but has since been discontinued.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} (Zor, Dikstein & Sulman, 1965 a, b) that the mono-amine oxidase inhibitor <b>mebanazine</b> inhibits the release of somatotrophin (STH). This could be demonstrated in rats by the marked decrease in {{the width of the}} epi-physial cartilage and by showing that the release of corticotrophin (ACTH), the natural antagonist of STH, was stimulated. This effect is greatly potentiated by corticosteroids. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate to which of the enzyme systems involved in growth the ability of <b>mebanazine</b> to inhibit growth is related. Immature male rats of the 'Sabra ' strain of the Hebrew University, 5 weeks old, weighing 60 =+- g., received i. p. injections of <b>mebanazine</b> resinate (which contains only 35...|$|E
40|$|Five {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOI) were tested for a {{correlation}} between MAO blocking potency, the effect on somatotrophic hormone(STH) production and metabolic effects on the pituitary. <b>Mebanazine,</b> N-acetyl-mebanazine and pargyline inhibited STH produc-tion, body weight gain and glucose- 6 -phosphate (G- 6 -P) dehydrogenase activity. MAOI which contain a hydrazine group (<b>mebanazine</b> and N-acetyl=req- <b>mebanazine)</b> also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity as well as DNA and RNA formation in the pituitary, while pargyline, which contains an amino group, was inactive in these respects. Iproniazid and norpargyline were inactive with regard to STH production, body-weight gain and metabolic activities of the pituitary: alkaline phos-phatase activity, G- 6 -P dehydrogenase activity, and DNA and RNA content. This suggests a relation between the ability of an MAOI to inhibit STH production and inhibition of the phosphogluconate oxidative pathway. introduction In previous publications (Zor, Dikstein & Sulman, 1965 a, b) {{it has been shown}} that many—but not all—monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) decrease pituitary weight and inhibit body growth and somatotrophic hormone (STH) and luteinizing hormone(LH) production (Wickström & Petterson, 1964; Zor, Ailabouni & Sulman, 1966). This effect may be related inter alia to changes of the phosphogluconate oxidative pathway ('pentose phosphate pathway') operated by TPNH which stimulates protein synthesis (Wilson & Siperstein, 1959). Field, Pastan, Herring & Johnson(1960) have therefore suggested that TPNH might be a prerequisite for the produc¬ tion of trophic hormones in the anterior pituitary. This pathway also produces ribose which is incorporated in the nucleic acids, thus contributing to the biosynthesis of vital proteins, especially enzymes and hormones...|$|E
40|$|In adult fowls the time-course of the {{neurotoxic}} {{effects of}} 5, 6 -DHT on indolaminergic neurons (in comparison with controls and with animals pre-treated with <b>mebanazine,</b> a MAO-inhibitor) was studied. It was shown that 5, 6 -DHT given {{into the third}} cerebral ventricle produced a rather selective degeneration of indolaminergic neurons which was most dramatic 4 and 7 days after the injection. Injured axons characterized by a pile-up of strongly yellow fluorescent material were seen in areas bordering the third ventricle, and in the posterior, medium and anterior hypothalamus, preoptic area, median eminence, n. tuberalis and paleostriatum augmentatum. A decrease in yellow fluorescence in areas distal to the injured axons was only detectable after 19 days. A certain regrowth of some terminal networks was observed 30 days after 5, 6 -DHT administration. Present data indicate that, in fowls, ascending indolamine neurons mainly originate in tegmental cell bodies and are organized in a large tract which runs along the medial forebrain bundle, sending terminals innervating several diencephalic and other subcortical areas...|$|E
