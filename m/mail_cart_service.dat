50|$|During {{the first}} and second Anglo-Maratha wars, it used to take 4-5 weeks to move {{materials}} from Mumbai to Pune. A military road constructed by the company in 1804 reduced the journey to 4-5 days. The company later built a Macademized road between the two cities in 1830 that allowed <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> <b>service</b> to begin between the two cities. Railway line from Bombay and run by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) reached the city in 1858. In the following decades the line was extended places further east and south of the city. In the east, GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 where it met the line of Madras Railway and thereby connected Poona to Madras. The Pune - Miraj line was completed in 1886. The completion of the Metre gauge Miraj line turned the city into an important railway junction. The Bombay-Poona line was electrified in the 1920s. This cut the travel time between the cities to three hours and made it possible to make day trips between the cities for business or leisure such as Bombay rich coming down to see the Poona races. Although railways came to Pune {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, public bus service took nearly ninety years to follow suit. Unlike Mumbai, Pune never had a tram service. The first bus service was introduced in Pune in 1941 by the Silver bus company. This caused huge uproar amongst the Tanga carriers (horse-drawn carriage) who went on strike in protest. Tangas were the common mode of public transport well into the 1950s. Bicycles were choice of vehicle for private use in the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Information {{professionals}} and librarians have been studying, discussing, and developing digital libraries {{for over two}} decades, but understanding ultimate use of images from digital libraries remains a mystery for many of them. Most articles written on digital library use focus on users’ search retrieval needs and behavior. Few mention how digital library patrons use the images they request. Like many digital libraries, archives, and special collections, the University of Houston Digital Library makes high resolution images available to their patrons. Image delivery is achieved by an automated system, titled the Digital <b>Cart</b> <b>Service.</b> An unexpected benefit of the Digital <b>Cart</b> <b>Service</b> is the reporting mechanism that produces data that includes intended use information. This article discusses the analysis of this data to determine why images were used, what products were created from the images, and what implications this has on digital library management.

50|$|Mailboy is the {{traditional}} name for the mailroom clerk who collects and delivers mail within a large organisation. A 'mailboy', delivers mail for other employees in different departments using a <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> or a trolley often sorting as he goes using the pouches or wallets {{that are part of}} the trolley. It is typically the most junior of roles and many employees start here so they can get a feel for the entire organisation, get to know everyone rapidly, and then to decide where in an organisation they would like to train for and work within. In the modern workplace it is a role suitable for people with learning difficulties and helps an organisation meet legislative quotas. A trolly with many slots is frequently used so that sorting can take place while the trolly does its rounds thereby reducing the amount of mail that has to be sorted in the mailroom.|$|R

500|$|A monthly {{mail route}} {{was set up}} in June 1841, {{travelling}} from Albany to Perth via Kojonup and Williams. The following year, a service through Guildford commenced. The tough conditions of the mail route saw a different contractor providing the service each year. The 1845 contractor James Martin had particular trouble with debts, which led to his mail horse being seized; while he managed to acquire a replacement animal, he also had trouble servicing the resultant debt of £2. In 1847, the Perth–Albany route was adjusted, so that the mail would travel from Albany to Kojonup, then head to Bunbury on the coast, and subsequently up to Perth via Rockingham and Fremantle. The new route still had difficulties, such as flooding in the winter of 1847 that resulted in a [...] "terrible trip" [...] which took a month to complete. The people of Albany, who could travel as passengers on the <b>mail</b> <b>cart,</b> found the trip to Perth long and deplorable.|$|R

Broughton and his {{accomplice}} John Oxley stayed in Sheffield {{the night before the}} robbery and then walked out of the town on the Rotherham road where they met the mail coming towards Sheffield. However, they intended to rob it on its way back to Rotherham so they lay in wait for it to arrive. George Leasley, the boy driving the <b>mail</b> <b>cart,</b> described how he was led into a field, blindfolded with a handkerchief, and his hands tied behind his back and fixed to a hedge. After about an hour he freed himself and found his horse, but the Rotherham post bag was gone. Broughton and Oxley escaped towards Mansfield.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{comprehensive}} study on how to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance for services with commutative operations. Recent research suggests that services may be implemented using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for highly efficient optimistic replication with the crash-fault model. We extend such studies by adopting the Byzantine fault model, which encompasses crash faults as well as malicious faults. We carefully analyze the threats towards the operations in a system constructed with CRDTs, and propose a lightweight solution to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance with low runtime overhead. We define a set of correctness properties for such systems and prove that the proposed Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms guarantee these properties. Furthermore, we show that our mechanisms exhibit excellent performance with a proof-of-concept replicated shopping <b>cart</b> <b>service</b> constructed using CRDTs...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{programming}} {{has become}} a topic of widespread interest, and many programmers now wrestle with tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and latency. Distributed transactions are often rejected as an undesirable tradeoff today, but {{in the absence of}} transactions there are few concrete principles or tools to help programmers design and verify the correctness of their applications. We address this situation with the CALM principle, which connects the idea of distributed consistency to program tests for logical monotonicity. We then introduce Bloom, a distributed programming language that is amenable to high-level consistency analysis and encourages order-insensitive programming. We present a prototype implementation of Bloom as a domain-specific language in Ruby. We also propose a program analysis technique that identifies points of order in Bloom programs: code locations where programmers may need to inject coordination logic to ensure consistency. We illustrate these ideas with two case studies: a simple key-value store and a distributed shopping <b>cart</b> <b>service.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|By 1811, Parramatta Road had officially open {{to traffic}} and was financed during {{a large portion}} of the 19th century by a toll, with toll booths located at what now is Sydney University and the Duck River. Governor Macquarie called tenders for the repair of the road raised a 3 {{shilling}} per gallon levy on spirits and levied a toll to pay for the work. The road was to be 10 metres wide. This turnpike road was opened on 10 April 1811. The toll barriers were at the present Railway Square and at Becket's Creek (near Parramatta).In 1814, a stage <b>cart</b> <b>service</b> was established along Parramatta Road. Sydney's oldest road and Australia's first intercity highway, fares were 10 shillings for passengers and 3 pence for letters. Heavy rain again nearly destroyed this road, so in 1817 it was announced that all tree-stumps would be removed and the road paved with stone which would be covered with earth and gravel. This improvement was announced as finished on 15 January 1815.|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{brokerage}} is an {{enabling technology}} allowing various services to be merged together for providing optimum {{quality of service}} for the end-users. Within this collection of composed services, testing is a challenging task which brokers have to take on to ensure quality of service. Most Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) testing has focused on high-level test generation from the functional specification of individual services, with little research into how to achieve sufficient test coverage of composite services. This paper explores the use of model-based testing to achieve testing of composite services, when two individual web services are tested and combined. Two example web services – a login service and a simple shopping service – are combined to give a more realistic shopping <b>cart</b> <b>service.</b> This paper focuses on the test coverage required for testing the component services individually and their composition. The paper highlights the problems of service composition testing, requiring a reworking of the combined specification and regeneration of the tests, rather than a simple composition of the test suites; and concludes by arguing that more work {{needs to be done}} in this area...|$|R

The first generation of these Bi-Level intercity cars, were dubbed the [...] "California Cars".When delivered these cars were plagued with problems and Caltrans actually refused the first attempted delivery due to cracks in the frame. That forced Morrison-Knudsen to ship the cars back to the manufacturing plant for repair. After Caltrans accepted delivery, these trains were first put in service on the San Diegan line (the predecessor to the Pacific Surfliner) and crews immediately encountered automatic doors that failed to function properly, causing delays in service. Attempted repairs failed to fix the problematic doors and failures continued for years with doors between train cars later failing to operate properly as well.|$|R
