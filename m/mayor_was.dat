5|$|Administrative systems fell {{within the}} hundreds. The Bath Hundred had various names {{including}} the Hundred of LeBuri. The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area {{outside the city}} and was later combined into the Bath Forum Hundred. Wealthy merchants had no status within the hundred courts and formed guilds to gain influence. They built the first guildhall probably in the 13th century. Around 1200 the first <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> appointed.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{held its}} first {{municipal}} elections in 1876, after the mukhtars ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) {{made the decision to}} elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.|$|E
5|$|David N. Cicilline {{finished}} his term as mayor in 2010, {{eight years after}} taking office as the first homosexual mayor of an American state capital.

5|$|By June, the <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> {{looking for}} {{political}} support {{to avert a}} full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E

5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 Nancy Astor {{was elected}} {{the first ever}} female member of {{parliament}} to take office in the British Houses of Parliament for the constituency of Plymouth Sutton. Taking over office from her husband Waldorf Astor, Lady Astor was a vibrantly active campaigner for her resident constituents. Plymouth was granted city status on 18 October 1928. The city's first Lord <b>Mayor</b> <b>was</b> appointed in 1935 and its boundaries further expanded in 1967 to include the town of Plympton and the parish of Plymstock.|$|E

5|$|The {{salary of}} the <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> set at $100,464 in 2003. In March 2012, the city's Salary Setting Commission {{proposed}} that the mayor be paid $235,000, but the city council unanimously rejected the recommendation, instead keeping the salary at the 2003 level. In March 2014, the Salary Setting Commission recommended no pay increase for the mayor or city council. Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases {{not be allowed to}} benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes.|$|E
5|$|As of , 35 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 36 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior {{to the establishment of}} successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward, Sr. and John F. Forward, Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor.|$|E
5|$|Barnette's first {{action as}} <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> {{to write a}} letter to Washington, D.C., asking the federal {{government}} to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the food shortage. This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds). Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city. In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand. In addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System, which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as <b>Mayor</b> <b>was</b> probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|He ran in {{the primary}} {{elections}} of the Justicialist Party (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became {{the new president of}} Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. Not seeing any chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Sharpe James, who {{defeated}} Gibson in 1986 {{and declined}} {{to run for}} a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by {{a federal grand jury}} sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty {{for his role in the}} conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of {{government}} (Plan 12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy <b>Mayor</b> <b>was</b> created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E
5|$|To date, 42 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 43 mayoralties due to Charles James Brenham's serving two non-consecutive terms: he is counted chronologically as both the second and fourth mayor. The longest term was that of James Rolph, who served over 18 years until his resignation to become the California governor. The length of his tenure as <b>mayor</b> <b>was</b> largely due to his popularity. During his term, San Francisco saw the expansion of its transit system, {{the construction of the}} Civic Center and the hosting of the World's Fair. The shortest term was that of Charles Boxton, who served only eight days before resigning from office. Two mayors have died in office: Otis died from illness and Moscone was assassinated. Dianne Feinstein is the only woman, Willie Brown is the only African American, and Ed Lee is the only Asian American to have served as mayor.|$|E
