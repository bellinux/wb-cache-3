5|$|Devi Purana {{describe}} a pentad of Matrikas who help Ganesha to kill demons. Further, sage Mandavya {{is described as}} worshipping the Māṭrpaňcaka (the five mothers), Chamunda being one of them. The <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> described as established by creator god Brahma for saving king Harishchandra from calamities. Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda, Devi Purana gives a different explanation: Chanda means terrible while Munda stands for Brahma's head or lord or husband.|$|E
5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> described as fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They {{are described as}} living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{increase}} is slightly smaller than shown for non-Hispanic whites and slightly different for non-Hispanic blacks because the birth figures shown refer to mothers of that race, not the children. Most non-white babies of non-Hispanic white <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> either Hispanic or black, and non-Hispanic black mothers occasionally have Hispanic children. On the other hand, all {{children born to}} Hispanic mothers, even if the <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> white Hispanic, are counted as Hispanic.|$|E

25|$|The {{intermarriage}} in the Italian {{community is}} very high {{and most of the}} younger members are half Italian on the paternal side.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working <b>mothers</b> <b>are</b> often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
