This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stony corals}} extend their tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding,</b> and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E

Sometimes a wet nurse is hired to feed the infant, although this is rare, especially in developed countries.|$|E

25|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> flight is most commonly used by austral storm petrels. The white-faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering, holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind it pushes itself off the water's surface in a succession of bounding jumps. Storm petrels also use dynamic soaring and slope soaring to travel over the ocean surface, although this method is used less by this family compared to the northern storm petrels. Slope soaring is more straightforward and favoured by the Oceanitidae, the storm petrel turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea.|$|E

2500|$|The smelt-whitings are benthic carnivores, {{with all}} of the species whose diets have been studied showing similar prey preferences. Smelt-whitings have well {{developed}} chemosensory systems compared to many other teleost fishes, with high taste bud densities on the outside tip of the snout. The turbulence and turbidity of the environment appear to determine how well developed the sensory systems are in an individual. Studies from the waters of Thailand, Philippines and Australia have shown that polychaetes, a variety of crustaceans, molluscs {{and to a lesser extent}} echinoderms and fish are the predominant prey items of the family. Commonly taken crustaceans include decapods, copepods and isopods, while the predominant molluscs taken are various species of bivalves, especially the unprotected siphon filters that protrude from the shells. In all species studied, some form of diet shift occurs as the fishes mature, often associated with a movement to deeper waters and thus to new potential prey. The juveniles often prey on planktonic prey, with small copepods, isopods and other small crustaceans often taken. Whilst many species have a change in niche to reduce intraspecific competition, there are often many species of sillaginid inhabiting a geographical area. Where this occurs, there is often definite diet differences between species, often associated with a niche specialization. The sillaginid's distinctive body shape and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, which is the predominant <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E

40|$|Mycotoxins are {{metabolites}} of moulds {{that may}} be found in food and <b>feed</b> <b>of</b> plant and animal origin. This paper gives a short review <b>of</b> the agronomical <b>methods</b> and food and feed storage recommendations for the prevention of mould contamination. It describes the practical <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> decontamination and the use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> additives where mycotoxin contamination prevention has failed. However, these methods should be avoided as much as possible because they may increase the cost of production, reduce the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> and leave residues of mycotoxins or their toxic metabolites. Since there is no universal and reliable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> decontamination for all mycotoxins, the paper stresses the importance of preventive measures. KEY WORDS: aflatoxins, decontamination, ergot alkaloids, fumonisins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes According to the evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 25 % of the world cereal production is contaminated by mycotoxins (1). Food and feed are usually contaminated by more than one mycotoxin, because a certain strain of moulds may produce different mycotoxins. Residues of mycotoxins may also be found in food of animal origin (meat, milk, eggs, and cheese) as the consequence <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> contamination. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds, {{and some of them are}} also mutagenic, genotoxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic. In mild climates, the most frequent toxicogenic moulds in food and feed are the species of genera Fusarium and Penicillium.

40|$|There is {{relatively}} little published research concerning {{the relationship between}} mothers' attitudes towards <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> infants and their choice of breast-feeding or bottle-feeding as <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> their own babies. The present study used Fishbein & Ajzen's theory of reasoned action to analyse {{the impact of the}} attitudes, perceived norms and beliefs of 50 primiparous mothers on (i) their intentions to breast-feed or bottle-feed, assessed antenatally; and (ii) their self-reported use of breast-feeding and bottle-feeding during the first six weeks of the baby's life. The findings were generally consistent with the theory of reasoned action. Attitudes to the infant feeding methods accounted for a large and significant amount of variation in intentions, and intentions in turn accounted for a large and significant amount of variation in infant feeding behaviour. However, there were some aspects of the findings that were not entirely consistent with the theory. Attitudes to behaviour contributed significantly and independently to the prediction of behaviour, and beliefs about the consequences of behaviour explained a near-significant amount of variation in intentions, beyond that already accounted for by attitudes and normative beliefs. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
