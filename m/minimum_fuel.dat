25|$|At one time, it {{held the}} record of 1,000 {{maintenance}} hours per flying hour. Although the Scimitar could operate as a fighter, the interceptor role was covered by the De Havilland Sea Venom and then the de Havilland Sea Vixen. The Scimitar itself {{was replaced by the}} Blackburn Buccaneer. The Scimitar was kept initially as a tanker to allow the underpowered Buccaneer S.1 to be launched from aircraft carriers with a useful weapons load. To save weight, the Buccaneer would take off with <b>minimum</b> <b>fuel</b> then top up from a Scimitar. Late in the Scimitar's operational career, examples were flown between 1965 and 1970 by the Fleet Requirements Unit (FRU) based at Bournemouth Airport (Hurn). The FRU was managed by Airwork Services and provided realistic flight operations for land and sea based naval training units.|$|E

Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to hear or understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a [...] "total breakdown in communications by the flightcrew."

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} obtain fuel-consumption curves for a single-cylinder engine with a Wright 1820 -G and Pratt & Whitney 1340 -H cylinder at varying speeds, manifold pressures, and air-fuel ratios. The 1340 - H cylinder was tested at speeds from 1, 200 to 2, 400 r. p. m. and at manifold pressures from 21 to 38 inches of mercury absolute. Less than extensive tests were made of the 1820 -G cylinder. The results of the tests showed that the <b>minimum</b> brake <b>fuel</b> consumption was obtained when the engines were operating at high torques and at speeds from 60 to 70 percent of the rated speed. The fuel consumption increased at an increasing rate as the torque was reduced; and, at 45 percent of maximum torque, the fuel consumption was 20 percent higher than at maximum torque when the engines were operating at 70 percent of rated speed. <b>Minimum</b> specific <b>fuel</b> consumption was obtained at the same air-fuel ratio regardless of compression ratio. No improvement in fuel consumption was obtained when mixtures leaner than an air-fuel ratio of 15. 5 were used. The leanest mixture ratio on which the engine with the 1340 -H cylinder would operate smoothly was 18. 5 and the spark advance for maximum power with this mixture ratio was 50 degrees B. T. C.

40|$|Convenient charts are {{presented}} for computing the thrust, fuel consumption, and other performance {{values of a}} turbojet system. These charts {{take into account the}} effects of ram pressure, compressor pressure ratio, ratio of combustion-chamber-outlet temperature to atmospheric temperature, compressor efficiency, turbine efficiency, combustion efficiency, discharge-nozzle coefficient, losses in total pressure in the inlet to the jet-propulsion unit and in the combustion chamber, and variation in specific heats with temperature. The principal performance charts show clearly the effects of the primary variables and correction charts provide the effects of the secondary variables. The performance of illustrative cases of turbojet systems is given. It is shown that maximum thrust per unit mass rate of air flow occurs at a lower compressor pressure ratio than <b>minimum</b> specific <b>fuel</b> consumption. The thrust per unit mass rate of air flow increases as the combustion-chamber discharge temperature increases.

50|$|Flight {{planning}} {{is the process}} of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. It involves two safety-critical aspects: fuel calculation, to ensure that the aircraft can safely reach the destination, and compliance with air traffic control requirements, to minimise the risk of midair collision. In addition, flight planners normally wish to minimise flight cost through the appropriate choice of route, height, and speed, and by loading the <b>minimum</b> necessary <b>fuel</b> on board.
