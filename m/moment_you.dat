5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
25|$|In {{the heat}} of the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> {{sometimes}} do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> know the velocity of the car. To understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed {{to look out the window}} of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E
25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. You should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to music, Sanz enjoys painting, which he often does {{while trying to}} create ideas for new songs. He explains that painting [...] "teaches you that taking risks rarely leads to failure. In fact, from the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> assume a risk, you have succeeded." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{chemistry}} between Cornell and {{the other}} three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: [...] "He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first <b>moment,</b> <b>you</b> can't deny it." [...] The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.|$|E

500|$|Stanton did {{not attend}} the 1896 convention; she was 80 years old, obese, and bedridden. She {{acknowledged}} the controversy stirred by the publication of the first part, but continued writing {{the second part of the}} book, and she worked on her autobiography Eighty Years & More: Reminiscences 1815–1897. She wrote to her longtime friend Reverend Antoinette Brown Blackwell in April, 1896 to observe: [...] "Our politicians are calm and complacent under our fire but the clergy jump round the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> aim a pop gun at them 'like parched peas on a hot skillet'".|$|E
500|$|West {{also offered}} {{to appear on}} Ocean's debut album, but Ocean refused, saying [...] "as much as I {{want to work with}} you… I kind of want to do this without you. I kind of want to do it on my own." [...] Rapper Nas was also a fan of the mixtape, writing that [...] "He's new, he's fresh. He doesn't sound fly-by-night. The <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> hear it — I hear what he's sayin', and I relate." [...] Nas also stated on Twitter that he and Ocean were collaborating on a song from Nas's tenth studio album Life Is Good, though the {{material}} never made the album. Chicago born rapper Lupe Fiasco expressed a positive opinion of the release too.|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E

500|$|In 1870 he was {{appointed}} a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and retired from his government post. Crease was suspicious of both Confederation and responsible government, largely because they threatened greater government control over judges and central Canadian domination of patronage. Like many British Columbians, he was disappointed that London seemed to {{have given up on}} BC as an independent colony, abandoning either it to annexation to the United States or confederation with Canada. [...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, whatever your POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – is to lose Caste the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> become a bona fide settler." [...] Regardless of his opposition to Confederation, Crease was chosen to prepare for it as the chair of the Royal Commission for the Revision of Laws of BC.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest <b>moment,</b> <b>you</b> know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|His {{realistic}} approach, designing dances {{that were}} inspired by the way ordinary people behaved, led one critic to observe that [...] "Kidd is, in a way, the originator of the fantasy that if only your life shaped up and offered <b>you</b> the right <b>moments,</b> <b>you</b> too {{would be able to}} dance like a Hollywood star".|$|R
6000|$|... "Aline, {{you are so}} {{extraordinary}} a mixture. At <b>moments</b> <b>you</b> shock me by the indecency of your expressions; {{at others}} you amaze me by the excess of your prudery. You have been brought up like a little bourgeoise, I think. Yes, that is it--a little bourgeoise. Quintin was always something of a shopkeeper at heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, {{without a}} doubt, the man," [...] Maraton assented cheerfully. [...] "I am {{an enemy of}} your class, Mrs. Bollington-Watts. Your husband is the steel millionaire, isn't he? And I am also a Socialist of the most militant and modern type. Nevertheless, I can assure you, for these few <b>moments</b> <b>you</b> are {{perfectly}} safe." ...|$|R
500|$|Zappa in New York {{featured}} {{a song about}} sex criminal Michael H. Kenyon, [...] "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. Zappa dismissed the criticism by noting {{that he was a}} journalist reporting on life as he saw it. Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: [...] "What do you make of a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the <b>moment</b> <b>you</b> hear them?" [...] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without Zappa's consent were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was overlooked {{in the midst of the}} legal problems.|$|E
500|$|Victorin Hulot {{is later}} visited by the Prince of Wissembourg, who {{delivers}} news of economic good fortune. The Marshal, {{prior to his}} death, had made arrangements for repayment of the Baron's debts, as well as employment for Adeline in a Catholic charity. Baron Hulot has disappeared, and Adeline spends her free time searching for him in houses of ill repute. She eventually finds him living with a fifteen-year-old courtesan, and begs {{him to return to}} the family. He agrees, but as he climbs into the carriage, Hulot asks: [...] "mais pourrai-je emmener la petite?" [...] ("But can I take the girl?") The Hulot home is reunited for a time, and Bette's fury at their apparent happiness hastens her death. One evening after the funeral, Adeline overhears Hulot seducing a kitchen maid named Agathe. On her deathbed, Adeline delivers her first rebuke to her husband: [...] "ans un moment, tu seras libre, et tu pourras faire une baronne Hulot." [...] ("In a <b>moment,</b> <b>you</b> will be free, and you can make another Baroness Hulot.") Soon after burying his wife, Hulot marries Agathe.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every <b>moment,</b> <b>you</b> feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
5000|$|... "This is the {{greatest}} <b>moment</b> that <b>you</b> and I have ever lived." ...|$|R
2500|$|Michael Paré was {{discovered}} in a New York City restaurant working as a chef. He said of {{his role in the}} film that it was [...] "a thrill I've never experienced. It's a really weird high. For a few <b>moments,</b> <b>you</b> feel like a king, a god. It's scary, a dangerous feeling. If you take it too seriously ..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris Jones of The Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] In {{the best}} <b>moments,</b> <b>you</b> feel like you're {{watching}} something deep and powerful, sourced by {{a work of}} fine literature, propelled into awareness by a potent film and, most crucially of all, a story that makes us feel we can control, if not transcend, {{the story of the}} end of our lives.|$|R
