40|$|The dynamic, expansive, and {{integrated}} nature of global <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> transportation systems motivates {{the need for}} modeling tools that can effectively evaluate a highly diverse assortment of <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> systems and markets. This thesis presents {{the development and implementation}} of a generic <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> transportation model that can be used to analyze a wide variety of <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> transportation systems and problems. The model was implemented into an MS Excel VBA program tool as a means of demonstrating the capabilities and use of the generic model. This tool was then used in a case study involving LNG shipping. The objective of the case study was to assess the effects of the Panama Canal tariff on an emergent LNG trade between the Gulf of Mexico and the Asia-Pacific region. The case study and discussions show that the model provides a sufficient core framework for maritime transportation systems, but has weaknesses in stake holder definition and available data compatibility. The core functionality that allows the model to represent a wide variety of problem types is its ability to very specifically or broadly define the entities within a transport system. </p...|$|E

First, the paper formulates a freight network model that captures decisions and interactions of ocean carriers and port terminal operators in the <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> transport system. Then, the emission cost is calculated based on an activity-based approach as a component of the ocean transportation cost function. A case study is examined to find if the emission cost affects ocean route choices.

The research discusses how the emission cost plays a role in route changes and why ocean carriers have to consider these costs in their routing decisions...|$|E
40|$|Global {{shipping}} lanes are {{the arteries}} of international trade. They {{are responsible for}} transporting 80 % of global freight by volume, thereby providing a crucial service to international economic development. In 2012, the <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> sector emitted 615 MtCO 2, comprising 2. 0 % of global CO 2 emissions (IEA, 2015 b). Projections indicate that CO 2 emissions will triple between 2010 and 2050 - since demand growth in freight services {{is likely to be}} stronger than (energy) efficiency improvements the coming decades (ITF, 2015). The latter is partly due to the conservative attitude of the sector towards innovation and climate policy (Cames et al., 2015). Consequently, the European Parliament warns that if the ambition of the international shipping sector continues to fall behind efforts in other sectors, and if action to combat climate change is further postponed, their shares in global CO 2 emissions may rise substantially to 17 % by 2050 (Cames et al., 2015). This study seeks to explain the evolution of final energy demand and CO 2 emissions from the global <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> sector up to 2050. This is explored from a bottom-up perspective, following a BAU pathway and a 2 DS pathway. The study also provides insight into the CO 2 abatement options available to the shipping sector to move from BAU to 2 DS emissions trajectories. Results indicate that according to BAU projections, CO 2 emissions from international <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> will grow with a factor 2. 73 between 2010 and 2050, to a total of 1937 MtCO 2 per annum in 2050. However, the 2 DS scenario requires a carbon budget for the <b>maritime</b> <b>freight</b> sector of 710 MtCO 2 in 2050. This is technologically achievable through the following CO 2 abatement options: 1) avoided demand of trade of oil, gas and coal 2) larger ships 3) improved operational and technical efficiency for new ships and retrofits 4) switching to LNG at 25 % of the fuel mix and 5) switching to biofuel at 25 % of the fuel mix. It {{is important to note that}} full implementation of these CO 2 abatement options is immensely ambitious. As such, this study emphasizes the urgency of timely implementation of globally binding policy targeting GHG emissions from ships. IMO, policy makers and the academic community should bring all hands on deck to achieve this – to reduce CO 2 emissions, and to design a roadmap to moving from a BAU to a 2 DS future where global temperature increase is limited to 2 °C only...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{understand}} the optimal leverage range for shipping companies (<b>maritime</b> foreign <b>freight</b> transportation companies - SIC 4412), through data analysis. This study confirms that in a traditional industry like shipping, the Market value-leverage curve {{is very similar to}} the theoretical curve, as proposed by traditional capital structure theories. In comparison to other industries, the trend shows that there is allowance for more debt in shipping, since the optimal capital structure is reached in relatively higher values. Between shipping companies, the study shows that the most definitive factor in determining the optimal leverage is the company type (type of ships owned), and somewhat the year range the company operated. Contrary to other industries, company size does not seem {{to play a major role}} in shipping. Data analysis using pure plays (groups of very similar companies) reels trend lines with higher accuracy, indicating the optimal leverage range of certain types of shipping companies. The most consistent result is that for tanker shipping companies, where the optimal leverage range is 65 - 75 %. by Vasilis Georgiadis. Thesis: S.
