5|$|The {{important}} <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> , {{sometimes called}} Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{exponential}} function {{can be characterized}} in many ways. The following characterizations (definitions) are most common. This article discusses why each characterization makes sense, and why the characterizations are independent of and equivalent to each other. As a special case of these considerations, we will see that the three most common definitions given for the <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> e are also equivalent to each other.|$|E

25|$|The Indiana Pi Bill is {{the popular}} name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, {{one of the}} most notorious {{attempts}} to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, rather than to establish a certain value for the <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of , such as 3.2.|$|E
25|$|Another of Einstein's notable thought {{experiments}} {{about the}} nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer performing experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> π than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.|$|E

25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

500|$|The Edge's guitar {{playing on}} The Joshua Tree is {{characteristic}} of {{what came to be}} his trademark sound. His minimalist style sharply contrasted with the emphasis placed on virtuosity and speed by heavy metal in the 1980s. The Edge views musical notes as [...] "expensive", preferring to play as few of them as possible and to instead focus on simpler parts that serve the moods of the songs. Much of this was achieved with a delay effect, contributing to a chiming, echo-laden sound. For example, the riff in the introduction of the opening track [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] is a repeated six-note arpeggio, with delay used to repeat notes. The riffs to [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] and [...] "With or Without You" [...] also prominently use delay, with Bono likening the guitar hook from the former track to [...] "chrome bells". Writer Derek White conducted a mathematical study of the Edge's rhythmic delay in an attempt to explain why his playing style on the record appealed to him so much. For a given song, White found that by dividing the number of repeated delay notes per minute by the song's tempo in beats per minute, he arrived at e, an important <b>mathematical</b> <b>constant</b> that is used to explain many natural phenomena.|$|E
