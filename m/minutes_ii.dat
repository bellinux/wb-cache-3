2500|$|The Killian {{documents}} controversy (also {{referred to}} as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six purported documents critical of U.S. President George W.

40|$|Albuminuria is a {{hallmark}} of kidney disease of various etiologies and usually caused by deterioration of glomerular filtration barrier integrity. We recently showed that angiotensin II (Ang II) acutely increases albumin filtration in the healthy kidney. Here, we used intravital microscopy to assess the effects of Ang II on podocyte function in rats. Acute infusion of 30, 60, or 80 ng/kg per <b>minute</b> Ang <b>II</b> enhanced the endocytosis of albumin by activation of the type 1 Ang II receptor and resulted in an average (±SEM) of 3. 7 ± 2. 2, 72. 3 ± 18. 6 (P µ m³ (P < 0. 001) albumin-containing vesicles per glomerulus, respectively, compared with none at baseline or 10 ng/kg per <b>minute</b> Ang <b>II.</b> Immunostaining of Ang II–infused kidneys confirmed the presence of albumin-containing vesicles, which colocalized with megalin, in podocin-positive cells. Furthermore, podocyte endocytosis of albumin was markedly reduced {{in the presence of}} gentamicin, a competitive inhibitor of megalin-dependent endocytosis. Ang II infusion increased the concentration of albumin in the subpodocyte space, a potential source for endocytic protein uptake, and gentamicin further increased this concentration. Some endocytic vesicles were acidified and colocalized with LysoTracker. Most vesicles migrated from the capillary to the apical aspect of the podocyte and were eventually released into the urinary space. This transcytosis accounted for approximately 10 % of total albumin filtration. In summary, the transcellular transport of proteins across the podocyte constitutes a new pathway of glomerular protein filtration. Ang II enhances the endocytosis and transcytosis of plasma albumin by podocytes, which may eventually impair podocyte function...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{the effect}} of {{angiotensin}} II on norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals through stimulation of presynaptic angiotensin II type 1 receptors are equivocal. Furthermore, evidence that angiotensin II activates the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in vivo is scarce or indirect. In the intact porcine heart, we investigated whether angiotensin II increases norepinephrine concentrations in the myocardial interstitial fluid (NE(MIF)) under basal conditions and during sympathetic activation and whether it enhances exocytotic and nonexocytotic ischemia-induced norepinephrine release. In 27 anesthetized pigs, NE(MIF) was measured in the left ventricular myocardium using the microdialysis technique. Local infusion of angiotensin II into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) at consecutive rates of 0. 05, 0. 5, and 5 ng/kg per minute did not affect NE(MIF), LAD flow, left ventricular dP/dt(max), and arterial pressure despite large increments in coronary arterial and venous angiotensin II concentrations. In the presence of neuronal reuptake inhibition and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, left stellate ganglion stimulation increased NE(MIF) from 2. 7 +/- 0. 3 to 7. 3 +/- 1. 2 before, and from 2. 3 +/- 0. 4 to 6. 9 +/- 1. 3 nmol/L during, infusion of 0. 5 ng/kg per <b>minute</b> angiotensin <b>II.</b> Sixty <b>minutes</b> of 70 % LAD flow reduction caused a progressive increase in NE(MIF) from 0. 9 +/- 0. 1 to 16 +/- 6 nmol/L, which was not enhanced by concomitant infusion of 0. 5 ng/kg per <b>minute</b> angiotensin <b>II.</b> In conclusion, we did not observe any facilitation of cardiac norepinephrine release by angiotensin II under basal conditions and during either physiological (ganglion stimulation) or pathophysiological (acute ischemia) sympathetic activation. Hence, angiotensin II is not a local mediator of cardiac sympathetic activity in the in vivo porcine heart...|$|R

In the documentary local practitioners, politicians and academics discuss critically the different strategies put in place to reverse the decline. These strategies presented include economics and housing, culture, education, and migration. Local governance and public spending play a key role. The documentary concludes with the city’s relative and fragile success (the fragility is underlined by the current economic crises) at the cost of social and physical polarisation.
