40|$|AbstractLeadership and {{teamwork}} are {{important aspects of}} personal and professional development (PPD) to be inculcated within medical students. PPD module had been included throughout the five-year period to achieve most of the eleven programme outcomes of UKM medical programme. As {{a part of the}} teaching-learning method (TLM) for PPD, three outdoor camps are scheduled for the medical students with main emphasis on teamwork and leadership. To determine the final year students’ perception on the achievement of UKM Medical Doctor (<b>MD)</b> <b>programme</b> outcomes, two self-assessment surveys were conducted. 222 students answered the first self-assessment survey in June 2009 before they attended the third camp in their final year. The questionnaire contained eleven programme learning outcomes including learning outcomes 3 and 4 which cover teamwork and leadership aspects. The student's perceptions on whether they have achieved the learning outcomes were rated on five-point Likert scale. Six months later, 177 students responded to the second survey. Majority of the students had either agreed or strongly agreed that they have achieved both programme learning outcomes before the camp. The percentages further increased after the camp. The outdoor camps are beneficial as experiential learning activities for teamwork and leadership among medical students...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT Although health {{sciences}} programmes {{continue to}} value non-cognitive {{variables such as}} interpersonal skills and professionalism, {{it is not clear}} that current admissions tools like the personal interview are capable of assessing ability in these do-mains. Hypothesising that many of the problems with the personal interview might be explained, at least in part, by it being yet another measurement tool that is plagued by context specificity, we have attempted to develop a multiple sample approach to the personal interview. METHODS A group of 117 applicants to the undergraduate <b>MD</b> <b>programme</b> at McMaster Univer-sity participated in a multiple mini-interview (MMI), consisting of 10 short objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) -style stations, in which they were presented with scenarios that required them to discuss a health-related issue (e. g. the use of place-bos) with an interviewer, interact with a standardised confederate while an examiner observed the inter-personal skills displayed, or answer traditional inter-view questions. RESULTS The reliability of the MMI was observed to be 0. 65. Furthermore, the hypothesis that context specificity might reduce the validity of traditional interviews was supported by the finding that the variance component attributable to candidate–sta-tion interaction was greater than that attributable to candidate. Both applicants and examiners were pos-itive about the experience and the potential for this protocol. DISCUSSION The principles used in developing this new admissions instrument, the flexibility inherent in the multiple mini-interview, and its feasibility and cost-effectiveness are discussed.

40|$|Introduction Mother-to-Mother (M 2 M) or “Mentor Mother” {{programmes}} utilise HIV positive {{mothers to}} provide support and advice to HIV positive pregnant women and mothers of HIV exposed babies. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported a Mentor Mother programme in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe from 2009 to 2012; with programme beneficiaries observed to have far higher retention at 6 – 8 weeks (99 % vs 50 %, p< 0. 0005) and to have higher adherence to Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) guidelines, compared to those not opting in. In this study we explore how the M 2 M progamme {{may have contributed to}} these findings. Methods In this qualitative study we used thematic analysis of in-depth interviews (n = 79). This study was conducted in 2 urban districts of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second largest city. Results Interviews were completed by 14 mentor mothers, 10 mentor mother family members, 30 beneficiaries (women enrolled both in PMTCT and M 2 M), 10 beneficiary family members, 5 women enrolled in PMTCT but who had declined {{to take part in the}} <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programme</b> and 10 health care staff members. All beneficiaries and health care staff reported that the programme had improved retention and provided rich information on how this was achieved. Additionally respondents described how the programme had helped bring about beneficial behaviour change. Conclusions <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programmes</b> offer great potential to empower communities affected by HIV to catalyse positive behaviour change. Our results illustrate how M 2 M involvement may increase retention in PMTCT programmes. Non-disclosure to one’s partner, as well as some cultural practices prevalent in Zimbabwe appear to be major barriers to participation in <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

This {{study examined the}} effects of a short-term mobility exercise programme on the balance and mobility of elderly residents residing in POAHs in Hong Kong. Subjects recruited from three POAHs were matched in demographic characteristics and ambulatory status before assigning them to either a mobility exercise (<b>M)</b> <b>programme</b> or control (C) programme of general exercise. Both programmes consisted of 18 sessions that were conducted three times a week over two months. The subjects' mobility and balance performance before, mid-term, at completion of the programmes and three months afterward was evaluated using the 4 -metre walk (4 MW) test, timed up-and-go (TUG) test and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Ten and eight subjects completed the <b>M</b> and C <b>programmes,</b> respectively. The <b>M</b> group did not demonstrate improvement in 4 MW, TUG or BBS score at completion of the programme. At 3 months after the programme, only the C group experienced a significant decrease in BBS score (p = 0. 02). The short <b>M</b> <b>programme</b> did not significantly improve the mobility and balance performance of elderly residents of POAHs, but the performance appeared to be maintained for three months after the programme stopped.

40|$|The School of Medicine (SoM) is {{one among}} five at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS). It {{currently}} houses eight undergraduate and many post-graduate programmes. The Doctor of Medicine (<b>MD)</b> <b>programme</b> reported herein {{is the oldest}} having ten semesters (5  years) followed by a 1  year compulsory rotatory internship at a hospital approved by the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT). However, this training was largely knowledge-based and thus the need to shift towards competency-based education (CBE) and full modularization necessitated this study. A cross-sectional tracer study of MUHAS MD graduates from SoM who completed training between 2006 and 2008 was conducted using quantitative (structured interviewer-administered questionnaires) as well as qualitative methods [In-depth questionnaire (IDI) and Focus group discussions (FGDs) ]. A total of 147 MD graduates were traced and interviewed, representing 29  % of the 510 students who graduated from the SoM between 2006 and 2008. Majority (70. 1  %, n[*]=[*] 103 / 147) were males. About 70  % graduated in 2008 and majority (68  %, n[*]=[*] 100 / 147) were doing internship. Majority (60. 5  % n[*]=[*] 89 / 147) were based in/near Dar es Salaam at district, regional or referral hospitals. With reasonable concordance, most competencies ranked low except on four aspects. Teaching, System-based Practice and Good Practice had the lowest. Seminars/Tutorials, Laboratory Skills/Practicals, Theatre Skills, Outpatients clinics, Family Case Studies, Visits/Excursions and Self Reflection were rated less useful teaching methods compared to Lectures, Teaching Ward Rounds, Elective Studies, Field Work, Presentations, Continuous Assessments Tests, Final Examinations, Short Answers, Clinical/Practical Examinations. ICT and Library facilities were not considered to meet the students learning needs and Clinical Logbooks also ranked low. Teachers were generally ranked less favorably including in professional role-modelling and accessibility outside scheduled teaching sessions. This tracer study results allowed subsequent curriculum review {{and the introduction of}} full modularization and competency-based learning at MUHAS. It is envisioned that these tracer study findings will improve teaching, learning and inform next curriculum review at MUHAS leading to increased output of appropriately trained health professionals to fill the big gap in human resources for health (HRH) in Tanzania.

40|$|Abstract: The Micro to Macro (I~ 2 <b>M)</b> <b>Programme</b> {{has been}} focused on {{developing}} under-standing of subsurface fluid flows within geological heterogeneities spanning wide ranges of spatial and temporal scales. This paper highlights the opportunities for industries to incor-porate recent observations and emerging theories in this field towards improved fluid resource management. The background to, and objectives of, the 1 ~ 2 <b>M</b> <b>Programme</b> are reviewed. Selected results from the projects in the programme are discussed and, where possible, compared with evidence from industrial field data. Some conclusions and rec-ommendations for future practice in reservoir characterization are made. For example, there is currently very little recognition of modern theories that point to the likelihood of prevailing criticality in the mechanical state of the Earth's crust and its implication for coherent large-scale collective behaviour emerging from small-scale interactions. Also associated with criticality are long-range spatial correlations and the lik lihood that flow properties change during the life of commercial developments: uch changes, for example, to absolute permeability, should be looked for and analysed for spatial and tem-poral patterns. Allied with these features is the importance ofcoupled processes, principall...|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} of educational opportunities internationally provides major prospects {{for developing countries}} to reform their education systems. The rise of new forms of transnational education, (the provision of education to learners in a country {{different from that of}} the provider) and the {{expansion of}} capacity building opportunities have helped developing nations to increase domestic access to international education and to enhance the quality of their local education systems through increasing the variety and relevance of their programmes. Pakistan, being a developing nation, faces huge educational challenges due to its highly rigid and bureaucratic system of education. It also faces a lack of resources and training opportunities to enhance and expand the capabilities of teachers and educational leaders. However, community based, not-for-profit institutions in Pakistan are making every effort to improve the quality of education through providing capacity building opportunities to teachers and educational leaders. Notre Dame Institute of Education (NDIE) in Karachi is one such kind of institute. It is affiliated with Karachi University (KU) and accredited with Australian Catholic University (ACU) and offers an <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> for educational leaders. This study explores the effectiveness of the transnational <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> at NDIE as a means of educational leadership capacity building in Pakistan. The main research problem was examined through four research questions which explored: the distinctive elements of the <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> offered at NDIE and its focus on capacity building; the contextual factors contributing to this capacity building; the impact of the <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> on the development of the leadership capacity of its graduates; and finally the contributions of this case study research to the understanding of issues related to transnational education focusing on educational capacity building. A qualitative approach, in the form of case study, was adopted for the research. The data was collected by means of survey questionnaires distributed to all the M. Ed. graduates; in-depth individual interviews and focus group interviews of selected graduates and NDIE teachers; analysis of the documents related to the <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> and the transnational partnership between ACU and NDIE, and the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s reflective journal. The comprehensive narrative indicates the use of appropriate means of qualitative data reduction, analysis and display. This study highlights the contribution of the NDIE <b>M.</b> Ed. <b>programme</b> to the development of educational leaders in Pakistan and its impact on graduates in terms of bringing about change in their knowledge, skills, attitudes and practices as educational leaders. Using the United Nations Development Programme 2 ̆ 7 s framework (2009), this study also provides insights into the process of capacity building through the transfer and successful application of knowledge, expertise and methodologies from one educational context into another very different educational context. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights into the contribution of ACU, Australian Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Education system to educational leadership capacity building in Pakistan.
