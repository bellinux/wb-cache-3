Also, electronics like the Rubik's Revolution and Slide were also inspired by the original. [...] One of the newest 3×3×3 Cube variants is the Rubik's TouchCube. Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand. The TouchCube was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York on February 15, 2009.|$|E

Enterprises effectively obtain and understand customer needs, and accurately define the demand information of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products</b> in the design process, which is the necessary precondition for the successful design of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products</b> in the global market environment. The designer obtains accurately and effectively information of demand of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products,</b> which is an important link of product design process. It will also directly affect the subsequent steps in the process of product development. Therefore, all aspects of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products</b> manufacturing enterprises work should depend on customer demand. To meet the design idea of customer demand should be fully integrated into every link in the development of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products.</b> Enterprise can not only shorten the time of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products,</b> but also {{have a significant impact on}} the design of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>products</b> quality...|$|R
