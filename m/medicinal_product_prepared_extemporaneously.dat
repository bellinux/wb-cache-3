In the third meeting, a seventh factor was incorporated into the algorithm; the availability of a mass-produced oral liquid dosage form in the United Kingdom. Then, in the last two meetings, the scientists (RBM and RL) integrated the clinician-derived list with the biopharmaceutical properties that complemented and validated the clinical rankings for the identified APIs.|$|R
3000|$|In {{this context}} {{it should be}} {{considered}} that the European Court of justice has recently clarified the situation for “magistral formulae” defined as “any <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> <b>prepared</b> in a pharmacy in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient” (The European Court of Justice.

The European Court of Justice specified that “[such a preparation] must of necessity be prepared {{on the basis of}} a prior prescription issued by a professional person qualified to do so”. This prescription must, in addition “be ‘for an individual patient’” and “that patient must be identified before the <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> is produced and it must be produced specifically for that patient”. In a simpler wording such preparations have to be “extemporaneously”. It was also stated that “that the exception provided for in that provision can only concern situations in which the doctor considers that the state of health of his individual patients requires that a <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> be administered for which there is no authorised equivalent on the national market or which is unavailable on that market”, clearly excluding competition with licensed <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Also specifically excluded in this ruling were preparations “on the basis of the needs known in advance, to be used in emergency departments and, in any event, on the basis of orders placed before a specified patient had been identified” and “Preparations prepared and delivered to non-hospital pharmacies, {{on the basis of a}} ‘subscription’, even if an ‘initial medical prescription’ was drawn up for each specific patient”. The Court ruled that the aforementioned preparations were not “magistral” but <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> “prepared industrially or manufactured by a method involving an industrial process…..

In our study, 15 different batches of premixes with a wheat bran component were tested for afl atoxin B 1 (AFB 1) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The samples tested showed contamination with AFB 1 ranging from 1. 5 to 35 ng/g (mean = 18. 79 ng/g). However, no correlation between AFB 1 levels and the month of collection or season of production was observed. Considering the composition of the premix, the only possible source of contamination with AFB 1 was wheat bran.

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> {{that contains a}} version of the active substance of an original biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or innovative <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine.
