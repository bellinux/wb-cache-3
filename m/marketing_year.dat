25|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 <b>marketing</b> <b>year,</b> about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{cash reserve}} has an adverse {{selection}} effect. Specifically, if investors know a {{company does not}} have to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong signal of overvaluation. This notion has not been explicitly studied in the extant empirical literature, despite its intuitiveness. Using a sample of acquisitions solely financed by stock to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that announcement returns are lower for a bidder with a higher excess cash reserve. This effect is stronger in hot equity <b>market</b> <b>years</b> or when a bidder's standalone value is more difficult to evaluate. I also find evidence supporting the idea that targets request cash payment to remove "lemon" bidders in normal (non-hot equity <b>market)</b> <b>years,</b> but accept too many stock offers in hot equity <b>market</b> <b>years.</b> After acquisitions, high-excess-cash-reserve bidders operationally outperform low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Further, they spend more funds on reducing debt but not more on investments, compared with low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Combined, these results show that cash reserve has information costs. Further, they highlight the importance of the two-sided information asymmetry framework of Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) in describing merger outcomes without resorting to behavioral or agency explanations.

40|$|In this article, we analyse the {{potential}} quarterly anomalies of Spanish stock returns.

Our results show no clear stock return anomalies during the first three quarters of the year that is consistent with the existing literature. Nevertheless, the results provide evidence of a significant anomaly for the last quarter, especially for loser small-cap stocks. This turn-of-the-year effect is stronger in bear <b>market</b> <b>years</b> than in bull <b>market</b> <b>years.</b> The daily return analysis for January shows that the main CAR is reached in the first trading days of the year and that the current personal income tax law in Spain has prolonged the duration of the January effect. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> is {{a period}} of one year (or {{sometimes}} less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and disposition of a commodity. (Disposition of an agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, as well as changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and disposition of some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for a crop commences at about the time of harvest. However, world markets or other factors may also influence choice of beginning date for the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for some commodities in some countries. Especially in the case of certain perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> may be less than a full year in length, because economic activity of interest for reporting and analysis may be concluded within just a few months.|$|E
