40|$|Correction: + authors: Marchal, B. & De Brouwere, V. (Lancet, Vol. 368, p. 2210) Because {{most women}} prefer professionally {{provided}} maternity care {{when they have}} access to it, and since the needed clinical interventions are well known, we discuss in their paper what is needed to move forward from apparent global stagnation in provision and use of maternal health care where maternal mortality is high. The main obstacles to the expansion of care are the dire scarcity of skilled providers and health-system infrastructure, substandard quality of care, and women's reluctance to use maternity care where there are high costs and poorly attuned services. To increase the supply of professional skilled birthing care, strategic decisions must be made in three areas: training, deployment, and retention of health workers. Based on results from simulations, teams of midwives and midwife assistants working in facilities could increase coverage of maternity care by up to 40 % by 2015. Teams of providers are the efficient option, creating the possibility of scaling up as much as 10 times more quickly than would be the case with deployment of solo health workers in home deliveries with dedicated or <b>multipurpose</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the Srivastava Committee {{recommended}} {{expansion in}} the role of ANM. Recommended expansion included the role of an ANM as a <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>worker.</b> Along with maternity care, the committee recommended that the ANM's work include child health (immunization) and primary curative care of villagers. The Indian Nursing Council (INC) accepted the recommendations of the committee and included them in the syllabus in 1977. This decision also reduced the training period of the ANM from 24 months to 18 months.|$|R
40|$|Context: Postponement {{of first}} {{pregnancy}} {{is known to}} be associated with a variety of interdependent factors such as age, education, income, occupation, religion, caste, and cash incentives. This paper examines the relationship and effects of some of these factors on postponement of first pregnancy among newly married couples in Satara district. Objective: To study the interdependency of age, years of schooling, income, and cash incentive on postponement of first pregnancy among newly married couples. Materials and Methods: This study employed quasi-experimental study design. Duly trained <b>multipurpose</b> <b>workers</b> interviewed husbands and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) interviewed the wives; preferably in separate rooms using pretested semi-open proforma. Statistical analysis was done using STATA® version 12 statistical software. Results: Out of 1, 355 participants; 704 couples successfully postponed first pregnancy by 2 years, but 651 couples could not do so. Participants were significantly successful in postponing pregnancy by 569. 13 vs. 353. 89 days for controls. Age and education of female participants were significantly associated with postponement of first pregnancy; while age, education, and income of male participants were not associated with postponement. Conclusions: Higher age, more education, and higher income appear to be associated with acceptance of postponement of pregnancy and appear to be acting synergistically in both male and female participants as compared to nonparticipants...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria {{was and is}} a major scourge in India {{contributing}} {{more than}} three-fourths of the total cases in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region. Malaria is largely infl uenced by the local environmental conditions but can be kept in check if the operational implementation of the National Antimalaria Program: (NAMP) is effective. Keeping in mind {{the context of the}} situation in Gujarat, there was an urgent need to carry out a study to assess the operational aspects of the ongoing malaria control program. Objectives: To assess the operational aspects of NAMP in "highrisk" areas of rural Vadodara, seeking bottlenecks and possible correlation to the malaria situation in those areas. Materials and Methods: From 269 "high-risk" villages, 20 villages were selected randomly from 10 Talukas. 40 slide (smear-) -negative, 19 slide (smear-) -positive, 10 laboratory technicians, 10 <b>MultiPurpose</b> <b>Workers</b> (MPW) Supervisors and 18 MultiPurpose (MPW) and 18 Voluntary Workers were interviewed. The performance of the malaria clinic and the NAMP staff was evaluated using a point system. Results and Conclusions: The monthly blood examination rate (MBER) targets could not be achieved in 8 out of 10 primary health centers (PHCs) by active surveillance workers (AS) workers. The mean time interval between blood smear collection (BSC) and its receipt in the laboratory was 7. 1 days. 46 &#x 0025; of smear-negative patients having received presumptive treatment (PT) and 22 &#x 0025; of smear-positive patients receiving radical treatment (RT) were supervised. Administration of "adequate" presumptive treatment and radical treatment to the above two sets of individuals was 65 &#x 0025; and 58 &#x 0025; respectively. Overall, the performance of 50 &#x 0025; of malaria clinics and 94 &#x 0025; of villages was poor to average.

40|$|Background: Leprosy is {{a chronic}} {{infectious}} disease that {{is associated with}} serious morbidity and is a disease of public health concern because of the case load and the social stigma attached to the disease. Aim: To understand the knowledge of, and attitudes towards, leprosy amongst healthcare providers in Assam, India. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted during March to June 2007 in different health institutions of the Kamrup district of Assam. Results: Among the program managers interviewed, only half were organizing training sessions, and 37. 5 % were involved in supervision of the program activities at the periphery level. Among the program managers who were involved with leprosy elimination, only half were organizing training session and 37. 5 % were involved in supervision of the program activities at the periphery level. Medical officers consistently demonstrated higher knowledge about leprosy, followed by health supervisors and <b>multipurpose</b> <b>workers</b> (MPWs), including nursing staff. Regarding training status with regard to leprosy, 90 % of medical officers, 80 % of health supervisors and around 87 % of MPWs (83 % of male MPWs and 89 % of female MPWs) had attended training programs on leprosy. Regarding WHO MDT, 80 % of health supervisors, 84. 8 % of male MPWs and 86. 2 % of female MPWs had an idea of MDT and treatment duration of various categories of patients. Conclusions: These observations suggest that there appear to be adequate knowledge and positive behavior among healthcare providers with regard to leprosy in this part of India. However, there is still a need to organize training programs at regular intervals to train new recruits, as well as reinforce and update the knowledge of those already trained...|$|R

40|$|Chlorination of wells {{water by}} the use of {{bleaching}} power {{is one of the most}} simple and cheap methods of assuring safe potable water in rural areas. The <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>workers</b> are entrusted with this task. These health workers were interviewed with a semi-structured open-ended schedule and their working was observed by work-study to know the difficulties faced by them during the process of chlorination. Majority of the workers were of the opinion that daily chlorination of wells during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in their respective areas was not feasible within the resources available at the block level. The main difficulties faced by them were the large number of wells and inadequate equipment for chlorination. The work-study revealed that most of the workers did not follow the correct method of chlorination and this invariably resulted in super-chlorination of well water thereby decreasing its acceptability by the community. The involvement of local volunteers could be possible solution in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD) {{is a common}} initial {{presentation}} of coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite the growing epidemic of CAD in India, the epidemiology of SCD is largely unknown. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to define the prevalence and determinants of sudden cardiac deaths in rural South India. Methods: Prospective mortality surveillance was conducted in 45 villages (180, 162 subjects) in rural South India between January 2006 and October 2007. Trained <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>workers</b> sought to do verbal autopsies within 4 weeks of any death. Detailed questionnaires including comorbidities and circumstances surrounding death were recorded. SCD was adjudicated using the modified Hinkle-Thaler classification. Results: A total of 1916 deaths occurred in the study population over the 22 month time period and verbal autopsy was obtained in 1827 (95 %) subjects. Overall mean age of the deceased was 62 ± 20 years and 1007 (55 %) were men.

40|$|Research question: Which {{system of}} {{registration}} of vital events is more efficient? Objective: To ascertain {{the efficiency and}} quality of vital events registration in the rural community. Study design: Population based cross-sectional. Settings: Rural areas. Sample size: All births and deaths which occurred during the year 96 - 97 in the community development block were incorporated in the study. Study variables: Births, deaths, cause of death, events missed by different agencies and quality of registration. Analysis: Simple proportions Results: During the reference {{period of one year}} 2617 births and 855 deaths were reported in rural population of 96242.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the patterns and determinants of maternal health care utilization across different social settings in south India: {{in the states}} of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) carried out during 1992 - 93 across most states in India are used. Results show that utilization of maternal health care services is highest in Kerala followed by Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Utilization of maternal health care services is not only associated {{with a range of}} reproductive, socio-economic, cultural and program factors but also with state and type of health service. The interstate differences in utilization could be partly due to variations in the implementation of maternal health care program as well as differences in availability and accessibility between the states. In the case of antenatal care, there was no significant rural-urban gap, thanks to the role played by the <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>workers</b> posted in the rural areas to provide maternal health care services. The findings of this study provide insights for planning and implementing appropriate maternal health service delivery programs in order to improve {{the health and well-being of}} both mother and child.

40|$|The Tamil Nadu {{model of}} public health is renowned for its success in {{providing}} quality health services at an affordable cost especially to the rural people. Tamil Nadu {{is the only state}} with a distinctive public health cadre in the district level and also the first state to enact a Public Health Act in 1939. Tamil Nadu has gained significant ground in the various aspects of health in the last few decades largely because of the significant reforms in its health sector which dates back to 1980 s which saw rigorous expansion of rural health infrastructure in the state besides deployment of thousands of <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>workers</b> as village health nurses in rural areas. Effective implementation of Universal Immunization Programme, formation of Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation for regulating the drug procurement and promoting generic drugs, early incorporation of indigenous system of medicine into health care service, formulation of a health policy in 2003 by the state with special emphasis on low-income, disadvantaged communities alongside efficient implementation of The Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project (TNHSP) are the major factors which contributed for the success of the state. The importance of good political commitment and leadership in the health gains of the state warrants special mention. Moreover, the economic growth of the state, improved literacy rate, gender equality, and lowered fertility rate in the last few decades and contributions from the private sector have their share in the public health success of the state. In spite of some flaws and challenges, the Tamil Nadu Model remains the prototype health care delivery system in resource-limited settings which can be emulated by other states also toward a better health care delivery system...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{discover}} {{the relationship between}} the socio-economic, demographic characteristics and complications for acceptors following Double puncture laparoscopic (DPL) and conventional tubal ligation (CTL) procedures in rural and urban communities and additionally, we also sought to study the occurrence of post tubal ligation syndrome. Methods: A follow up study on 1000 women over a period of two years was conducted. The study was divided into 2 groups: 500 women undergone double puncture laparoscopic (DPL) sterilization and another 500 women underwent conventional tubal ligation (CTL). The acceptors were personally interviewed as per the guide lines in the proforma in the field at their door steps with help of <b>multipurpose</b> health <b>workers</b> (ANM) of the area concerned in the rural areas. Results: The mean age of DPL and CTL groups were 24. 4 years and 23. 8 years, respectively. The acceptance of type of procedure was almost equal in all religious groups. As the level of education increases there is clear correlation with DPL acceptance. The overall acceptance of tubectomy was higher in house wives (61 %) than the working women (39 %). However house wives preferred to undergone conventional tubectomy more (63 %) than the DPL (59 %). The DPL acceptors were more of higher economic status (49 %) whereas CTL acceptors were more of lower economic status (54. 4 %). The overall complications of DPL acceptors were lower than CTL acceptors. Moreover, these complications didn&# 8217;t influence with socio-economic, demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Age, religion, literacy status, economic status & occupation of acceptors didn&# 8217;t influence the occurrence of complications and post tubal ligation syndrome does exist in both groups.

Until now, its use {{is very limited}} in the health sector. A pilot study was carried out {{to improve the quality}} of home-based postnatal care by microteaching of health workers (HWs) and ascertain its feasibility for supportive supervision. Methods: All (n= 12) the HWs catering to a population of ~ 0. 1 million were video recorded while performing home-based postnatal check up in Chandigarh from August 2013 to December 2014. After each round, HWs were shown their videos and trained in the facility and at home. Video recordings, assessments followed by training, continued until HWs acquired the intended skills. A pretested structured checklist based on the national home-based postnatal care guidelines was used for recording and assessing of postnatal skills. A score “ 0 ” given for no task, “ 1 ” for incorrectly done or partially done task, and “ 2 ” for correct task. The average score of each round was calculated and compared. Results: The overall skill assessment score improved from 0. 64 to 1. 76, newborn examination skill from 0. 52 to 1. 63, maternal examination from 0. 54 to 1. 62, and counseling from 1. 01 to 1. 85 after three rounds of video recording. The proportion of HWs carrying a thermometer increased from 21 % to 100 %. Second and third rounds of video recording and microteaching were successfully carried out by the program supervisors.

40|$|Introduction: India is {{undergoing}} rapid epidemiological transition {{as a consequence}} of economic and social change. The pattern of mortality is a key indicator of the consequent health effects but up-to-date, precise, and reliable statistics are few, particularly in rural areas. Methods: Deaths occurring in 45 villages (population 180 162) were documented during a 12 -month period in 2003 - 04 by <b>multipurpose</b> primary healthcare <b>workers</b> trained in the use of a verbal autopsy tool. Algorithms were used to define causes of death according to a limited list derived from the international classification of disease version 10. Causes were assigned by two independent physicians with disagreements resolved by a third. Results: A total of 1354 deaths were recorded with verbal autopsies completed for 98 %. A specific underlying cause of death was assigned for 82 % of all verbal autopsies done. The crude death rate was 7. 5 / 1000 (95 % confidence interval, 7. 1 - 7. 9). Diseases of the circulatory system were the leading causes of mortality (32 %), with similar proportions of deaths attributable to ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Second was injury and external causes of mortality (13 %) with one-third of these deaths attributable to deliberate self harm. Third were infectious and parasitic diseases (12 %). Tuberculosis and intestinal conditions each caused one-third of deaths within this category. HIV was assigned as the cause for 2 % of all deaths. The fourth and fifth leading causes of death were neoplasms (7 %) and diseases of the respiratory system (5 %). Conclusion: Non-communicable and chronic diseases are the leading causes of death in this part of rural India. The observed pattern of death is unlikely to be unique to these villages and provides new insight into the rapid progression of epidemiological transition in rural India...|$|R
