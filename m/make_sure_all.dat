5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} reduce the delay between the local and {{international}} releases, the English voice acting for XIII was done while the game was in development. Unfortunately, it lacked the infrastructure needed to support simultaneous development and localization. The lack of deadlines, poor communication and synchronization between the various departments, and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development. One of the most notable knock-on effects was that the game's script needed to be re-translated as the various cutscenes changed, and large parts of the dialogue had to be rerecorded, party because they lacked proper emotional drive at the right moments. For XIII-2, a tool called Moomle, developed by English translator Tom Slattery and his Japanese counterpart Teruaki Sugawara from their experience with the first game, was used to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> parts of the localization process were synchronized. For Lightning Returns the Japanese voice actors recorded their dialogue well after their characters' scenes had been created, as opposed to the normal procedure of recording lines before cutscene creation. For the English version, the amount of dialogue translation and recording was so large that there was over two months' delay between the game's local and international releases.|$|E

These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a paper boat. The lanterns are used to direct the ghosts back to the underworld, and when they go out, it symbolizes that they have found their way back.|$|E

Some of the main ingredients used to create ketchup include sweeteners, vinegar, salt and spices, and flavouring. These additions are usually integrated later on in the process with the exception of some spices added in at the beginning. Throughout the entire process, temperature must be consistently monitored to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> the ingredients are being added and absorbed properly. Air is then removed in order to prevent oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190°F (88°C) to prevent contamination.|$|E
25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders {{is to make sure}} their respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> members in the row are striving for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during the week before the rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E
25|$|School psychologists provide {{intervention}} and treatment to reach goals. They assist with trauma and crisis; work with children, teachers, and families {{to deal with}} hurdles that are preventing success; educate and expand skills to cope with problems. They utilize prevention and early intervention to limit troubles in children’s lives and in the school environment. School psychologists help create an equal and encouraging school, bring attention to mental health issues and develop {{ways to deal with}} issues individually and school-wide, they team up with teachers and parents to address effective behavior plans, and ensure acceptance and value of diversity. School psychologists administer assessments and address difficulties all students face in psychological, social, personal, emotional, and educational/learning development. They also review and revise techniques to deal with problems of students and in schools to maintain a good, safe setting. They provide consultation and case management by ensuring students’ needs are met; speak out for students {{in and out of the}} school; <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> people involved with the student are aware of the needs of the student, what resources are available, and how to get the services; aid in the communication between parents, schools, and community services; and modify achievement plans to best meet needs of student. School psychologists seek assistance from community services in mental health, health, and crisis response; educate the public, parents, and schools through trainings on issues facing students and schools. Finally, School Psychologists are experts in research. As noted by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, 2007) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2007), school psychologists adhere to the scientist-practitioner framework and make decisions based on empirical research. School psychologists must be aware of and contribute to the study of the best approaches to helping students, families, and schools reach their goals.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{missions}} {{were designed}} to suit the story, rather than the story to fit the missions. Taking inspiration from GoldenEye 007, the team added a difficulty system that changes mission objectives; Leonard said [...] "it allowed the designers to create a very different experience at each level of difficulty, without changing the overall geometry and structure of a mission. This gave the game {{a high degree of}} replayability at a minimum development cost". The team extended the concept by decreasing the player's ability to kill human characters on higher difficulty settings. Writer and voice actress Terri Brosius said: [...] "We took pains to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> the missions could be won without killing any humans".|$|E

Roode was whipped twice during the encounter; the first when he was thrown to the ringside area, while the second was when he fell to the outside. LAX won the match at 10 minutes and 6 seconds when Hernandez pinned Roode following LAX's signature 5150 tag team maneuver.|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We learned to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1873, {{the failure}} of Jay Cooke & Co. precipitated first the Panic of 1873 and in its wake the worst U.S. {{financial}} depression up to that time, which resonated with the concurrent transatlantic Long Depression. Initially, northeastern U.S. anthracite markets were not badly affected, largely due to controls put in place by Gowen's coal pool. In 1874, in addition to shoring up this coal pool's internal checks to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> members played by the rules, Gowen also organized Schuylkill County's independent coal operators into the Schuylkill Coal Exchange. By autumn 1874 it was common knowledge that these operators (including the Coal & Iron Co.) were intent upon precipitating a ruinous miners' strike by which to destroy the WBA (by this time renamed the Miners and Laborers Benevolent Association, or M&LBA). [...] Such a strike was indeed brought about by severe slashes in wages offered to miners (20% cut) and mine laborers (10% cut). Known as the [...] "Long Strike", the work stoppage lasted through June 1875, ending {{in the collapse of}} the union.|$|E
2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We tried morphing to a live action Hoff – {{but it did not}} hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn't {{want to go to the}} same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> the effects stuck correctly to the body… so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt." [...] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment. Gunn added that there are [...] "over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it." ...|$|E

As {{a result of the}} satellite broadcasts, U2 promised to play in Sarajevo. The Sarajevo show had to wait until the PopMart Tour, when U2 became the first major band to perform in the city after the war had ended. [...] The highly emotional concert was among the highlights of the PopMart Tour. 45,000 people attended and effort was made to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> the ethnic groups were present. Also in attendance were several hundred members of the international [...] "Stabilisation Force" [...] (SFOR) who were tasked at that time with upholding the Dayton Agreement.

[...] Luciano Pavarotti, who was guest vocalist on the original recording was not in Sarajevo. However, his vocal was retained. An old style phonograph, complete with amplifying horn, was brought on stage for the song and its stylus was moved into position by Brian Eno to coincide with the tenor's vocal contribution. Unfortunately, the performance of this song did not go as well as planned as the band's timing was off and Bono was having difficulty with his voice. It was in this context that Bono chose to apologize to the audience for the band not being able to [...] "fucking play it."
