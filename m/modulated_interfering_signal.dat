40|$|Abstract — Several {{technologies}} {{have been added}} to wireless communication systems that increase reliability of these systems and afford them higher data rates. These new technologies when combined with the multiple layers of a communications network make the analysis of these systems increasingly complex. The work here analyzes the impact of placing a modulated interfering transmission in the guard band of a wireless packet based (infrastructure) network on the end user TCP performance. Wireless networks, such as LTE, employ at the physical layer orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) while at the data-link layer they use hybrid auto-repeat-request (HARQ) and a finite length queue; they also utilize cross-layer optimization to improve performance. These protocols allow the wireless network the ability to adapt to an ever changing fading environment. The following work shows the effect of a <b>modulated</b> <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> in the guard band of an OFDM system on the end-to-end TCP performance. In some cases the impact from the interference is indistinguishable from the effects of channel fading.

We obtain upper bounds on the bit error rates (BER's) for the chip-synchronous system and ihe chip-asynchronous system {{in the presence of a}} single <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> which <b>interferes</b> in one time-chip. We also obtain upper bounds on the BER for the chip-synchronous system with multiple-user interference, for the special case where each time-chip has at most one <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> of the same power as the desired signal. We find that, for thechip-synchronous system, the upper bound on the BER when one time-chip has two <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> is larger than the upper bound on the BER when each of the two time-chips has a single <b>interfering</b> <b>signal.</b> We also discuss system performance for a,large number of simultaneous users, and examine the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) approximation for the multiple-user interference. Finally, results for the chip-synchronous system with single interference in one time-chip over a Rayleigh fading channel are presented...|$|R
30|$|Additive {{interference}} {{is generated}} by an undesired signal which {{is added to the}} desired signal and it includes: cochannel interference and adjacent channel interference. Cochannel interference occurs when the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> has the same carrier frequency of the useful information signal. Adjacent channel interference can be further categorized into in-band interference and out-of-band interference: in-band interference occurs when the center of the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> bandwidth falls within the bandwidth of the desired signal; out-of-band interference occurs when the center of the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> bandwidth falls outside the bandwidth of the desired signal. The latter type of interference can be experienced when transmitters and receivers operate close together in terms of the two main variables that determine their degree of isolation from each other: distance and frequency separation.|$|R

We have proposed analytical expressions in a closed form and theoretical dependences, linking the degree of the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> suppression with the microphones sensitivities difference. Simulation, performed in MATLAB environment (version 7), has confirmed the validity of theoretical results. In the course of modeling the authors have obtained experimental dependence of the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> suppression on the microphones sensitivities difference. This dependence gives the possibility to define a tolerance on a difference between microphones frequency responses, which guarantees the required <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> suppression at the useful signal selection.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a multi-user MIMO broadcast wireless channel where a MAC layer scheduler {{is used to}} improve system efficiency and provide quality of service improvements (fairness) to users. In particular, an alpha-rule scheduler is considered that uses rate estimates from users to make user selection decisions. The main challenge faced by the scheduler is that users need to estimate the interference caused by other users before transmit antenna allocation has been done. The paper examines two techniques for estimating data rates. The first technique assumes no <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> are present and the second technique includes the dominant <b>interfering</b> <b>signal.</b> We show that the scheduler can be tuned to significantly increase fairness with little reduction in mean sum rate to users and we show that both mean sum rate and fairness can be increased by including the dominant <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> to estimate data rates. 6 page(s...|$|R
