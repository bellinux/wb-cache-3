50|$|In 1910, the Philips company erected {{new houses}} {{to serve the}} growing need for {{employee}} housing. The area, fittingly named Philipsdorp ("Philips Village"), was built on walking distance from the Philips factories and located (at that point) in the outskirts of Eindhoven. Urban planner Gerrit Jan de Jongh envisaged a village green in the center, creating a space for leisure and sports. In this green, a football field, a korfball field and a bandstand were planned. The area was named the Philips Sportpark. Meanwhile, Philips founded a football team for its young employees, named Philips Elftal. Their first <b>match</b> <b>marks</b> the first recorded use of the Philips Sportpark: on 15 January 1911, the Philips Elftal won their debut match against Hollandia from Woensel. The Philips Elftal continued {{to play at the}} field for two seasons; in 1913 the team was succeeded by PSV, who also took the Philips Sportpark as their home ground. PSV’s first official home game was the Eindhoven derby against EVV on 10 October 1915.|$|E
50|$|In the 1984-85 season Trevor Watkins {{was again}} {{captain of the}} 1st XI but the {{problems}} experienced {{in the second half}} of the previous campaign persisted. A disappointing league season yielded just 13 points, two above the relegation zone, and a 1-0 win over Pembroke Wanderers in April, thanks to a goal from a young Mickey Nichols, was a much more significant result than it appeared at the time. However, an excellent run in the Irish Senior Cup brought victories over Antrim and Raphoe and we met Lisnagarvey in the quarter final at Blaris. Disaster struck a few days before this game when David O'Driscoll snapped an achilles tendon in training which kept him out of hockey for over a year. The quarter final developed into a major rearguard action with Tommy Allen and Noel Mclean playing starring roles until substitute Ian Kirk-Smith scored for Lisnagarvey at the end of forty minutes extra time. This <b>match</b> <b>marks</b> the final Irish Senior Cup appearances of two great stalwarts Keith McCracken and John Baker.|$|E

This <b>match</b> <b>marks</b> the second time the two would face each other at a WrestleMania, the first being WrestleMania X-Seven ten years earlier. Before their WrestleMania match, both men had a face to face encounter on the March 28 episode of Raw, only to be interrupted by Shawn Michaels, who critictized Triple H for believing that he could defeat The Undertaker at the event, something that Michaels wasn't able to do. After The Undertaker said that Michaels was history, Michaels attempted to superkick him, but The Undertaker retaliated with a chokeslam that was stopped by Triple H, who then asked Michaels why he is going to defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania. Michaels, however, left the ring, unable to give Triple H an answer, believing that Triple H couldn't defeat The Undertaker at the event.|$|E
