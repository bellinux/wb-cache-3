5|$|The Allied advance was {{severely}} hampered by poor communications in these crucial initial phases. The paratroopers' radio sets range was instantly {{limited by the}} wooded terrain and as the battalions advanced they lost contact with Divisional HQ at the landing zones. Over the coming nine days, radio communication within the division, with Browning's HQ at Nijmegen, with XXX Corps and with the United Kingdom would be intermittent and unreliable, severely hampering the British units. Carrier pigeons were even used to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Britain. Partly {{as a consequence of}} this limitation, Urquhart decided to follow the 1st Parachute Brigade and <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Lathbury. When he found the Brigade HQ on Lion route, he was informed by Major Hibbert, who, at that time, was still en route to the bridge, that Lathbury himself was visiting the 3rd Battalion. Urquhart followed Lathbury there but subsequently {{would not be able to}} return to Divisional HQ for two days.|$|E

After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given a good reason to do so.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Born near Mobile, then {{a part of}} French Louisiana, on May 31, 1760, Simon Favre {{was the son of}} Jean Claude Favre (1721–1782) and Marguerite Wiltz (1740–1805). His grandfather, Jean Baptiste Favre, {{came from}} Royan, France, and by {{tradition}} was a cabin boy when Pierre D'Iberville placed him on shore near Biloxi to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the natives. His father was a government interpreter who was commissioned to explain the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763) to the natives upon the conclusion of the French and Indian War. Favre's mother was the daughter of a Swiss soldier.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
5|$|On 21November, {{a conference}} between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey {{was held in}} Brisbane at which {{it was decided to}} land a small force in the Arawe area. This {{operation}} had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the Marines once they landed. It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
