5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be a diversion.|$|E
5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> have been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E

25|$|The fall in bed bug populations {{after the}} 1930s in the {{developed}} world is believed partly due to the use of DDT to kill cockroaches. The invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role. Others believe it <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be the cyclical nature of the organism.|$|E
25|$|It {{also sought}} to take some blame away from Tinsley, because {{he may have been}} {{suffering}} from a form of epilepsy which affected his short term memory, which they argued would have explained why he <b>might</b> have <b>simply</b> not been aware of the waiting local train.|$|R
50|$|Self-report {{studies have}} {{validity}} problems.

25|$|When the Assyrians {{attacked}} Judah in 701 {{they did}} so via the Philistine coast and the Shephelah, the border region which included Micah's village of Moresheth, as well as Lachish, Judah's second largest city. This in turn forms the background to verses 1:8–16, in which Micah warns the towns of the coming disaster (Lachish is singled out for special mention, accused of the corrupt practices of both Samaria and Jerusalem). In verses 2:1–5 he denounces the appropriation of land and houses, which <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be the greed of the wealthy and powerful, or possibly {{the result of the}} militarising of the area in preparation for the Assyrian attack.|$|E
25|$|The ground setting (GKX in {{the above}} example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel {{reasoned}} that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine. If {{that was the first}} message of the day and the operator had set the ring settings with the rotors already inside the machine, the rotor position currently showing on the machine could well be the ring setting itself or be very close to it. (If that situation occurred {{in the above}} example, GKX would be the ring setting or close to it).|$|E
25|$|The term 'potential superpowers' {{has been}} applied by {{scholars}} and other qualified commentators {{to the possibility of}} several states achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Due to their large markets, growing military strength, economic potential, and influence in international affairs, China, the European Union, India, and Russia are among the countries (or political entities) most cited as having the potential of achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts, however, whether any of these countries would ever emerge as a new superpower. Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be emerging powers, as opposed to potential superpowers.|$|E

25|$|At {{various times}} in the past two hundred years, it has been {{suggested}} that not all the letters are genuine. Questions were first raised in 1806 by Ignaz Fessler, and were renewed by J. C. Orelli in 1844 and Ludovic Lalanne in 1855, who all suggested that the letters <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be a literary fiction. Doubts were raised at intervals in the succeeding decades. More recently, John Benton hypothesised (in 1972) that the entire letter collection might have been forged in the late 13th century, or by Abelard himself (a position Benton had reverted to by 1979). In the aftermath of reaction to Benton's thought, though, scholars have become more confident in asserting the genuine nature of the letters.|$|E
25|$|Oakley(1998) dismisses {{these claims}} of {{doublets}} and inclines towards believing {{there were three}} battles. The Samnites would have gained significant ground in Campania {{by the time the}} Romans arrived and Valerius' two victories could be the outcome of twin Samnite attacks on Capua and Cumae. And while Samnite ambushes are somewhat of a stock motif in Livy's narrative of the Samnite wars, this <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> reflect the mountainous terrain in which these wars were fought. The story of Decius as preserved has been patterned after that of the military tribune of 258, but Decius could still have performed some heroic act in 343, the memory of which became the origin of the later embellished tale.|$|E
25|$|Labor {{leaders were}} also {{convinced}} of the McNamaras' innocence by other factors as well. The open shop movement and virulent hostility shown by Otis convinced many that the whole event was a frame-up (with some, including Eugene V. Debs, accusing Otis himself of bombing the Times building). Burns repeatedly implied that Gompers and other labor leaders {{were involved in the}} national bombing campaign, and AFL officials feared a national campaign of arrests designed to destroy the nascent labor movement might be in the works. Meanwhile, George Alexander, Mayor of Los Angeles, was locked in a very close re-election battle against Job Harriman, a Socialist Party of America candidate. The bombing, some felt, <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be a plot to keep Harriman out of City Hall.|$|E

30|$|Likewise when a user submits an {{application}} for admission, the user must submit a service level request that captures the desired performance requirements that {{could be in a}} similar graph structure. Clearly for many applications, these resource graph structures may be simple, such as an individual server, or have a well-known, stereotypical structure. An example of this <b>might</b> be <b>simply</b> streaming a movie to a viewer. Some applications, however, may have detailed, highly structured, and even hierarchical SLA requests.|$|R
25|$|Bed bugs occur {{around the}} world. Rates of infestations in {{developed}} countries, while decreasing from the 1930s to the 1980s, have increased dramatically since the 1980s. Previous to this they were {{common in the}} developing world but rare in the developed world. The increase in the developed world may have been caused by increased international travel, resistance to insecticides, and the use of new pest-control methods that do not affect bed bugs. The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of DDT to kill cockroaches. The invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role. Others believe it <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be the cyclical nature of the organism.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
500|$|Even {{after the}} loss of Da Nang, [...] "the worst single {{disaster}} {{in the history of}} South Vietnam", the Ford administration continued to disbelieve that the Saigon regime was failing. On 10 April President Ford went to Congress to request a $722million supplemental military aid package for South Vietnam plus $250million in economic and refugee aid. Congress was not impressed, believing that the administration <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> be stalling the evacuation of remaining U.S. personnel and civilians in order to force the aid bill through. On 17 April the discussion was ended. There would be no more funds for Saigon.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively—just {{as in the}} [...] "turkey" [...] (which is {{also from}} America), or the [...] "guineafowl" [...] (which {{are not limited to}} Guinea)—"Muscovy" [...] <b>might</b> be <b>simply</b> a generic term for a {{hard-to-reach}} and exotic place, in reference to the singular appearance of these birds.

500|$|Lastly, Summoning {{magic was}} {{to consist of}} [...] "Call" [...] and [...] "Gate" [...] spells, the former {{summoning}} entities able to exist for a set duration of time, or until slain. Summoned creatures behaved in different manners; one type <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> defend the caster, while another worked to heal the caster {{and his or her}} allies. Gate spells opened a portal, allowing different things access to the game's world. Lead designer David Maldonado called the resulting spells [...] "generally amongst the weirdest in the game," [...] with the effect often being a combination of [...] "normal" [...] spells fired simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|While {{being the}} Geschwaderkommodore of JG 1 Oesau {{frequently}} received {{his share of}} Hermann Göring's anger and frustration over the failure to beat off the Allied bomber offensive. Göring questioned the commitment of commanders who were not flying regularly and thus not really [...] "leading" [...] their respective units. In this context it should be stated that {{in order not to}} risk one of the Luftwaffe experts life , there was an automatic ban on Oesau for further combat flying since his 100th victory. Perhaps the ban was lifted temporarily or bypassed when he was appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG 1. On the other hand, Oesau <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> have ignored the ban and continued to lead missions.|$|E
500|$|Quiet Versailles, {{the seat}} of royal power, was a {{stifling}} environment for reformers. Their stronghold was in Paris. The bustling metropolis lay within walking distance, less than [...] to the northeast. The reformist deputies were well aware that the four hundred or more monarchist deputies were working to transfer the Assembly to the distant royalist city of Tours, a place even less hospitable to their efforts than Versailles. Worse, many feared that the king, emboldened by the growing presence of royal troops, <b>might</b> <b>simply</b> dissolve the Assembly, or at least renege on the August decrees. The king was indeed considering this, and when on 18 September he issued a formal statement giving his approval to {{only a portion of}} the decrees, the deputies were incensed. Stoking their anger even further, the king even stated on 4 October that he had reservations about the Declaration of the Rights of Man.|$|E
25|$|Because games do {{not need}} to mimic actual physics, {{stability}} is not as much of an issue. Almost all games use a posteriori collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules.

Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow him to move that far.|$|R
