40|$|The most {{well-known}} way to produce bioethanol {{is by the}} enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of starch. In a new project “BioConcens” (2007) sponsored by DARCOF (DAnish Research Center for Organic Food and farming) one aim {{is to develop a}} combined ethanol and biogas production for use in organic farming using starch containing biomass. Natural enzymes from cereals will be used for hydrolysis of starch to glucose in accordance with technology in brewing technology. Commercial enzymes are often produced from gene-modified organisms and will therefore not be used in the suggested organic context or process. A preliminary study was performed in which grains of wheat, rye, and barley were germinated using traditional methods applied in malting for beer production. During <b>malting</b> the <b>amylase</b> enzymes present in the grain are activated (autoamylolytic effect).

40|$|The study {{consists}} {{in the production}} of a traditional beer from maize in the Congo. The traditional method of brewing corn malt has three main stages: malting corn, brewing corn malt and fermentation. During the brewing corn <b>malt,</b> endogenous <b>amylase</b> activity is destroyed during the stiffening of the starch to about 80 °C. A pre-cooking of the mash is necessitated to promote amylolyse at 50 °C with an exogenous enzyme. The use of a preparation of α-amylase can liquefy the mash and produce a sweet wort (average density = 12. 5 ° Balling) rich in dextrin corresponding to an apparent extract of 4 ° Balling in beer. The rising profile of the pH of the corn malt mash, from mashing to extract the wort does not affect the pH of the beer produced. This beer, slightly alcoholic (3. 6 % ethanol), is characterized by a nomal acid pH (pH = 4. 15 on average) and a brown color (25 EBC units). Its slight bitterness (21 EBU) and the fine aroma of a beer closer barley produced industrially in the Congo...|$|R

40|$|In the {{research}} projects on {{development of the}} fermented beverage from minor crop cereals such as buckwheat, com, millet, sorghum and others, in order to utilize these cereals more effectively as human food, the beer-like alcohol {{has been able to}} be produced by using at first tataricum buckwheat seed and malt after through trial and error at the authors' laboratory. It has been expected that strong yellow color and bitter taste components in the tataricum buckwheat might be dissipated or changed into other substances through fermentation although these components are not yet identified. The beer-like alcohol made from tataricum buckwheat was amber liquid and quite tasty without a bitter taste. There are at least two stages of beer brewing, one is hydrolysis of starch into the fermentable sugars by <b>malt</b> <b>amylase,</b> the other is fermentation of the sugars into alcohol by using yeast. In the case of using tataricum buckwheat as a part of starch the type of amylase used is very important. At the laboratory some kinds of amylase preparations as well as malt were used, as a result malt was more effective for obtaining the fermentable sugars from the tataricum buckwheat seed. In future the hydrolysis stage should be examined more in detail...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{molecular}} markers in plant breeding is well underway. Though they are expensive to develop, molecular markers {{open the possibility}} of reliable and rapid selection {{for a wide range}} of traits. In many cases marker-based selection will eventually be more efficient and cost-effective than evaluation of plants in the field. Marker-based selection has particular potential for the genetic improvement of traits that must be painstakingly evaluated after harvest, such as malting quality in barley. The objective of this study is to generate and identify molecular markers to be used in marker-assisted breeding for disease resistance, quality, and agronomic traits in barley. Molecular markers such as RFLPs (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms), AFLPs (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms), and SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats) are being used. Major traits of interest are scald resistance, net blotch, stripe rust, basic vegetative period, plant height, time to maturity, grain size, <b>malt</b> extract, alpha <b>amylase</b> activity and grain yield. This process requires the construction of a mapping population with the parents that differ for the desired traits and fingerprinting of the progeny lines with the markers. Depending on the size of the population and the genetics of a trait a full population analysis or a bulk segregant analysis will be used, with the DNA markers, to identify significant chromosomal regions so called 'Quantitative Trait Loci'...|$|R
40|$|Specific enzymes {{have been}} used to improve flour quality for bread but enzyme action in tortilla flour has not been investigated. Two {{different}} wheat flours were prepared into tortillas using laboratory-scale, commercial equipment with fixed processing parameters. Dough and tortilla properties were evaluated using subjective and objective methods. Tortillas were stored in plastic bags at 22 ????C for evaluation. The effects of nine enzymes (amyloglucosidase 1, amyloglucosidase 2, bacterial 1, bacterial 2, fungal, maltogenic 1, maltogenic 2, malted barley and xylanase) on quality of wheat flour tortillas were evaluated. Dough absorption was adjusted to attain uniform dough for tortillas. Enzyme addition to tortilla flour did not significantly affect tortilla weight, moisture and pH. Bacterial 2 amylase extended shelf stability while maltogenic 1 and xylanase exhibited smaller improvements in shelf stability and other tortilla properties. Addition of 0. 05 activity unit bacterial 2 amylase improved tortilla diameter and improved tortilla shelf life from 12 to 28 days. Maltogenic 1 at 280 ppm improved tortilla diameter, opacity and shelf life. Addition of 100 ppm of xylanase effectively improved tortilla diameter and shelf life. Bacterial 1 amylase at 60 ppm improved tortilla diameter but did not improve shelf stability. Amyloglucosidase 2, maltogenic 2 and <b>malted</b> barley <b>amylase</b> did not improve tortilla quality at any of the evaluated levels. Amyloglucosidase 1 and fungal amylase reduced overall tortilla quality at all the evaluated levels. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is correlated with the damaged starch present in the flour. Damage was induced by grinding the samples for 0, 1, 4 and 8 hr {{to determine the effects of}} starch damage on tortilla quality. Processing increased starch damage of control tortilla flour from 5. 4 % to 12. 6 %. Damage starch increased dough water absorption, toughness and press rating and reduced diameter and opacity of tortillas. Damage starch improved tortilla rollability at higher levels but did not improve tortilla properties in combination with bacterial 2 amylase. Overall tortilla quality was not improved due to additional starch damage. Improved tortilla quality using bacterial 2 amylase at very low levels could be commercialized...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the interaction between sorghum grain hardness and sorghum malt quality in terms of diastatic power and free amino nitrogen with endosperm modification during malting. The changes in kernel hardness during malting of four commercial sorghum cultivars of differing quality in terms of endosperm texture and potential malt quality were measured using tests for hardness and density, and endosperm modification was followed by scanning electron microscopy. The general pattern of modification during sorghum malting was confirmed {{to start at the}} ensdosperm-scutellum interface, then into the floury endosperm towards the kernel distal end. Significantly, a cultivar of intermediate hardness and low malting quality remained harder and modified more slowly than a harder cultivar of high malting quality. It appears that intrinsic grain hardness and <b>malt</b> <b>amylase</b> and protease activity both affect malt hardness and endosperm modification, but amylase and protease activity have a greater effect due to their degradation of endosperm starch and protein. Of the hardness and density tests studied, the Tangential Abrasive Dehulling Device (TADD) gave the best measure of hardness throughout malting; maximum range 24 % to 100 % kernel removed over 5 days malting. Also, the data agreed with the observed malt modification rates. Thus, the TADD may have application as a simple and rapid test for estimating sorghum malt quality.

40|$|We {{developed}} a kinetic procedure for determina-tion of amylase activity in serum {{by use of}} neph-elometric measurements. Light scattering from the substrate, a stable suspension of starch, is decreased as amylase hydrolyzes the starch to soluble fragments. Values obtained for serum amylase correlate closely with those determined by a method in which a starch-dye complex is used. Precision of the new procedure is 3. 4 % (relative standard deviation). Units of amylase activity can either be {{expressed in terms of}} milli-grams of starch consumed or converted to more conventional amylase units. Additional Keyph rases light-scattering measure-ments #{ 149 } liquid starch substrate Several methods have been developed for mea-surement of serum amylase activity; the most popular involve iodometric (1), saccharogenic (2 - 4), turbidimetric (5 - 8), or dye-complex spec-trophotometric techniques (9 - 11). The simplest approach to the estimation of amylase activity would be direct photometry of changes in con-centration of the starch substrate. Because starch is colloidal, continual recording of concentration is possible and, thus, a kinetic assay can be ob-tained. Single-point turbidimetric procedures for serum and urine amylase measurements have been described (5 - 8) and, in 1966, Roth (12) used a more sensitive nephelometric technique for mea-suring the rate of hydrolysis of starch by <b>malt</b> <b>amylase.</b> The present report describes a new method for measuring amylase activity in serum; light scat-tered by a stable starch suspension is continually recorded, and enzyme activity is determined kinet-ically...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Malting characteristics of sixteen sorghum varieties were investigated using a standard malting procedure. Clean grain was placed in nylon bags, steeped for 20 h, treated with 2 % sodium hypochlorite, and washed. Germination proceeded at 28 'C and 95 % relative humidity (RH) for 5 days. The wet malt was dried at 50 'C for 24 h. Total dry matter loss ranged from 8 - 19 %. Black Tx 430 had the highest losses. Density decreased for all the sorghums after malting; the extent of decrease was cultivar dependent. The (X- and P-amylase activity in sorghum <b>malts</b> produced (x- <b>amylase</b> levels ranging between 25 - 183 U/g. Black Tx 430 (183 U/g) and RTx 435 (178 U/g) had the highest values. Commercial barley malt had an (X-amylase activity of 189 U/g. P-Amylase activity was low for all cultivars, ranging from 11 to 41 U/g, with BTx 2752 and IS 9530 having the highest values. Decrease in RVA viscosity was significantly correlated with the (x-amylase calorimetric assay (r= 0. 97). The RVA is a promising method to measure (X-amylase activity; it is simple, fast, and requires minimum chemicals. Sorghum diastatic power (SDU) was not significantly correlated to (x-amylase activity at SDU values below 30. Above 30 SDU, (x- amylase activity was significantly correlated to diastatic power. Dry matter loss was significantly correlated to (Alpha-amylase activity and SDU. The green malt moisture was significantly positively correlated to dry matter loss. Malts produced from College Station cultivars gave higher (X-amylase levels than those from Lubbock. P-Amylase activities ranged from 28 - 33 U/g in the malts regardless of growth location. A second malting procedure using jars for steeping and germination was applied to 6 cultivars, and resulted in lower dry matter losses and 0 -amylase activity. Although (x-amylase levels were generally higher for the standard method, cultivars responded differently. Each cultivar may need optimum conditions to obtain the highest level of enzyme activity. Malting procedures require further control to obtain desired enzymatic levels with the least possible dry matter loss...|$|R
40|$|The use of enzymes for hydrolysing starch in cane juices {{has been}} applied in South Africa for some years. Bacterial amylases, notably those derived from Bacillus subtilis, have the {{advantage}} of stability at higher temperatures. Factory trials have shown that application of less than 10 ppm of bacterial amylase can destroy over 85 % of the starch in mixed juice in fifteen minutes. Applications of enzymes to syrup and clarified juice have also yielded promising results. Historical The process of decomposition of starch in cane juice {{has been applied}} many times during the history of sugar production. Haddon and de Sornay reported on the high starch content of Uba cane in 1927. 9, 10 A year later Haddon reported the removal of starch from sorghum and Uba juice by the use of a <b>malt</b> <b>amylase.</b> " ^ l 2 Feuilherade reported on the experimental use of an enzyme "Uba~e". ~ Though the source of this enzyme was not disclosed, it appears that the price was in the region of four rand per pound. The enzyme was apparently of low activity as it had to be used at a rate of 100 ppm on juice. Feuilherade assumed that the starch was completely transformed into glucose, and based a quantitative determination on this assumption. Boyes 2 used malt enzyme for the decomposition of cane starch in juices and massecuites, but found that the price remained prohibitive for general application. In 1958 Nicholson and Horsley published the presence of an amylase in cane juice, and described a method for the elimination of cane starch in juice. 14 These authors reported a degree of starch decomposition of 80 - 90 %, and occasionally even higher, at a temperature of 70 °C and a pH 5. 7 to 5. 9. The "natural enzyme " method was used experimentally at various sugar factories in Natal and adopted as a standard practice by The Tongaat Sugar C~mpany. ~ Carter 6 published results with this process in which 50 to 60 % of the starch originally present was decomposed at a pH of 6. 5 in eight minutes. In the 1967168 season the average amount of starch decomposition was 70 % 4. During the 1967168 season several other South African sugar factories started to apply the natural enzyme process...|$|E
