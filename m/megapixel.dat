5|$|The third-generation iPad (marketed as The new iPad, colloquially {{referred}} to as the iPad 3) is a tablet computer, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. The third device in the iPad line of tablets, it added a Retina display, the new Apple A5X chip with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5 <b>megapixel</b> camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and support for LTE networks in North America. It shipped with iOS 5.1, which also provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch <b>MegaPixel</b> grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E

25|$|In November 2001, Canon {{released}} its 4.1 <b>megapixel</b> EOS-1D, the brand's first professional digital body. In 2003, Canon introduced the 6.3 <b>megapixel</b> EOS 300D SLR camera (known in the United States and Canada as the Digital Rebel and in Japan as the Kiss Digital) with an MSRP of US$999, {{aimed at the}} consumer market. Its commercial success encouraged other manufacturers to produce competing digital SLRs, lowering entry costs and allowing more amateur photographers to purchase DSLRs.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels. More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors {{tend to have}} higher <b>megapixel</b> ratings. A larger <b>megapixel</b> rating does not mean higher quality. Low light sensitivity {{is a good example}} of this. When comparing two sensors of the same size, for example two APS-C sensors one 12.1 MP and one 18 MP, the one with the lower <b>megapixel</b> rating will usually perform better in low light. This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger, and more light is landing on each pixel, compared with the sensor with more megapixels. This is not always the case, because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software, and higher ISO settings to make up for the loss of light per pixel due to higher pixel density.|$|E

25|$|The Apple iPhone {{is a small}} {{device with}} {{multimedia}} capabilities and functions as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller. The iPhone 4 is thinner than previous models, has a five <b>megapixel</b> camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and adds a secondary front-facing camera for video calls. A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.|$|E

500|$|While chairman, Jobs visited {{university}} {{departments and}} faculty members to sell Macintosh. Jobs met Paul Berg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in Silicon Valley to honor François Mitterrand, then President of France. Berg was frustrated by the expense of teaching students about recombinant DNA from textbooks instead of in wet laboratories, used for the testing and analysis of chemicals, drugs, and other materials or biological matter. Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time. Berg suggested to Jobs to use his influence at Apple to create a [...] "3M computer" [...] workstation for higher education, featuring more than one megabyte of random-access memory (RAM), a <b>megapixel</b> display and megaFLOP performance, hence the name [...] "3M".|$|E
500|$|The [...] uses {{a system}} on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6. The SoC {{comprises}} a 1.3GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266MHz. The 's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, {{the same as the}} 4S; plug-in memory cards are not supported. The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4S had. The iPhone 5 retains the 8 <b>megapixel</b> back camera on the iPhone 4S, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225hours of standby time and ≤8hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions. This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions. The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|The S4 Active {{inherits}} {{most of its}} hardware components {{from the}} S4, including an identical Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, and a 5-inch 1080p display. However, its display is a TFT LCD display instead of the S4's Super AMOLED, and the S4 Active uses an 8 <b>megapixel</b> camera instead of the 13 <b>megapixel</b> camera of the S4. Its hardware design {{is similar to the}} S4, except it is slightly thicker, has metallic rivets, includes flaps to cover ports when not in use, and uses three physical navigation keys instead of a physical home key and capacitive back/menu keys like the S4. The S4 Active is designed towards the IP67 specifications, meaning that it can withstand up to 30 minutes underwater at a maximum depth of , and is also resistant to dust. The S4 Active launched with similar software to the S4, Android 4.2.2 with TouchWiz. Its camera software replaces the [...] "Dual Shot" [...] mode with an [...] "Aqua Mode" [...] designed for taking photos underwater, which disables the touchscreen and uses the volume keys as a shutter.|$|E
