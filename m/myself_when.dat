5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{performed}} [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] at London's G-A-Y nightclub on 24 September 2011. She pre-recorded {{a performance}} of [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] for UK television programme The Alan Titchmarsh Show during the same taping as {{a performance of}} [...] "Lucky Day". The taping came after deciding [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] would be released as the third single from the album, with Roberts saying, [...] "I absolutely love performing Yo-Yo, it's my favourite one to do [...] So I feel really close to Yo-Yo. I feel like I lose <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I'm performing it". After {{the release of the}} single, Roberts performed on The Album Chart Show during a special dedicated to her, performing three tracks: [...] "Yo-Yo", [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Sticks + Stones". Roberts also performed the song on British chat show Loose Women and on the Digital Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 2, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, [...] "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province." [...] Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it {{was reported}} that Williams' surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: [...] "I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I entered politics". Williams said although he had [...] "the utmost confidence" [...] in his own province's health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo [...] "a very specialized piece of surgery [...] somebody who's doing this {{three or four times a}} day, five, six days a week." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Made It" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Tye Tribbett and David Outing. Prior to its release on her album The Definition Of... (2016), Fantasia {{had played a}} portion of the song on Periscope and revealed to her fans that she worked with Tribbett. In the video, she incorrectly reported that she had handled the songwriting by herself. Tribbett explained its concept and his collaboration with Fantasia to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, saying: [...] "We've been talking about working together for a minute. So when the opportunity came {{it was kind of like}} a no brainer". He said that he instantly agreed to work with Fantasia after receiving a phone call to write a song for her. Fantasia had contacted Tribbett at the suggestion of music executive Ron Fair. Prior to the writing process, Tribbett had asked to [...] "do it on [...] terms" [...] and [...] "maintain the integrity of his message" [...] by creating an inspirational gospel record. He used Fantasia's testimony, as well as his own experiences with God, as inspiration for the lyrics. He described the song as the result of a close connection between Fantasia and himself: [...] "I basically just combined testimonies between her and <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I wrote the song and it resonated so richly with her, her audience and with everybody." ...|$|E

I formed a large part of these heathen Indians into mission settlements, when some were wandering through the forest as fugitives and others living in concealment near the lagoons because of the murders and enslavements they formerly suffered from the men of Pará.

2500|$|Schmidt {{resigned}} as the Lions' head coach on January 12, 1973. At {{a press conference}} announcing his decision, Schmidt said, [...] "I really don't enjoy coaching anymore. [...] It {{got to be a}} burden more than a fun-loving game. I promised my family and <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I started coaching that I would get out when it stopped being fun. Unfortunately, it's reached that point." [...] In six years under Schmidt, the Lions compiled a 43–34–7 record and finished in second place each year from 1969 to 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Su, {{to explain}} his {{vegetarian}} inclinations, said that he never had been comfortable with killing animals for his dinner table, but had a craving for certain foods, such as clams, so he couldn't desist. When he was imprisoned his views changed. [...] "Since my imprisonment I have not killed a single thing... having experienced such worry and danger <b>myself,</b> <b>when</b> I felt just like a fowl waiting in the kitchen, I can no longer bear to cause any living creature to suffer immeasurable fright and pain simply to please my palate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as <b>myself,</b> <b>when</b> the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. But I used to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 a {{group of}} black motorcyclists, and the South Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, sued the city of Myrtle Beach and some {{businesses}} there alleging discrimination. The city was accused of abusing traffic law enforcement and of excessive force by the police to harass black bikers. Many businesses closed their doors or cut back their hours during Black Bike Week, and 28 of them, including Red Lobster and Denny's were named in the suit. A Baltimore, Maryland police detective who is also a motorcyclist told The New York Times, [...] "I've seen it <b>myself.</b> <b>When</b> the white bikers come to Myrtle Beach, the town rolls out the red carpet. When the black riders come, they roll it right up." [...] City officials said that the much younger crowd, and nearly double attendance, of Black Bike Week justified the difference in the city's response to the two events.|$|E

2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I promised <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I finished The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for <b>myself,</b> <b>when</b> I start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was learning to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] said Wemmick, [...] "that's over! He's a {{wonderful}} man, without his living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw <b>myself</b> up <b>when</b> I dine with him,--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it, Mother; then I'll help <b>myself,</b> and <b>when</b> I do, God {{help you}} all," [...] {{and with a}} contemptuous shrug of her broad {{shoulders}} she walked away, leaving the poor old Prioress almost in tears.|$|R
6000|$|It {{did seem}} to me rather heinous, and I {{did not try to}} defend <b>myself,</b> even <b>when</b> she added, from her access of nervousness, in {{something}} like a whimper, [...] "It seems to me you're always dressing, Basil!" ...|$|R
