40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the vulnerability of roof tile systems and <b>metal</b> <b>shutters</b> to roof tile debris. Three phases addressed the performance of tile roof systems and <b>metal</b> <b>shutters</b> impacted by roof tile debris. The first phase experimentally evaluated the tile fragment size and quantity generated by a tile striking a tile roof system. The second phase experimentally quantified the puncture vulnerability of common <b>metal</b> panel <b>shutter</b> systems as a function of tile fragment impact speed. The third phase provided context for interpretation of the experimental results through the use of a tile trajectory model. The results provide supporting evidence that while <b>metal</b> panel window <b>shutters</b> provide significant protection against a prevalent form of windborne debris, these systems are vulnerable to tile fragment puncture in design level tropical cyclones. These findings correlate with field observations made after Hurricane Charley (2004) ...|$|R

50|$|Focal-plane {{shutters}} {{are also}} difficult to synchronise with flash bulbs and electronic flash {{and it is}} often only possible to use flash at shutter speeds where the curtain that opens to reveal the film completes its run and the film is fully uncovered, before the second curtain starts to travel and cover it up again. Typically 35mm film SLRs could sync flash at only up to 1/60th second if the camera has horizontal run cloth curtains, and 1/125th if using a vertical run <b>metal</b> <b>shutter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM2 compared to the FM were silicon photodiode light meter sensors, limited automatic dedicated electronic flash control and, most famously, a mechanically-timed vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> (bearing mounted for reduced friction and extended life) reaching {{a top speed of}} an unprecedented 1/4000th second, with an X-sync of 1/200. This shutter was able to reach such ultra-fast speeds because its titanium honeycomb curtains had a travel time of 3.3 milliseconds, half of typical vertical travel metal-bladed focal plane shutters of the time.|$|E

25|$|This {{commonly}} used nickname originally {{related to his}} consistent political resolve rather than to any particular incident. In various cases its editorial use appears to be disparaging. It is likely that its use became more widespread after an incident in 1832 in which he installed <b>metal</b> <b>shutters</b> to prevent rioters breaking windows at Apsley House. The term may have been made increasingly popular by Punch cartoons published in 1844–45.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the methods and}} results of three experimental investigations regarding the vulnerability of residential windows and window protection systems to windborne debris impact. The first experimental investigation quantified the momentum threshold required to damage unprotected residential window glazing due {{to the impact of}} asphalt roof shingles and wooden dowels (vegetation). The second experimental investigation documented the performance of <b>metal</b> <b>shutters</b> due to the impact of whole concrete roof tiles and 2 x 4 lumber. The third experimental investigation addressed the frangibility of roof tile systems under impact by roof tiles, and the puncture vulnerability of <b>metal</b> hurricane <b>shutters</b> under impact by roof tile fragments. These studies confirm that the use of window protection to mitigate damage from windborne debris is effective. However, properly installed and code approved protection systems are vulnerable to failure in strong hurricane conditions...|$|R
50|$|The FM3A was the {{successor}} to the renowned Nikon FM2N camera of 1984 and was the last member of the successful, semi-professional line of Nikon compact 35 mm film SLRs. The other members were the Nikon FM (released 1977), FE (1978), FM2 (1982) and FE2 (1983). They (and the Nikon FA) all used the superficially similar (but not identical) rugged copper-aluminium alloy chassis and high-quality Nikon vertical bearing-mounted <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> and ball-bearing mounted film advance, but with improved feature levels, minor external controls and cosmetic differences. The newer low-budget Nikon FM10 and FE10, while named similarly, are completely different introductory-level cameras manufactured by Cosina.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966 Asahi Optical showed another {{prototype}} called Metalica, {{sometimes referred}} to as Metallica II. Gone was the cumbersome selenium light meter, replaced with a now standard internal CdS meter. Like the 1960 prototype, the Metalica had a bayonet lens mount, and also featured an improved Copal-square metallic shutter. But the biggest innovation was the fully automatic shutter operation coupled to the TTL meter. The metering system, {{for the first time in}} a 35mm SLR, controlled the shutter speed automatically based on the aperture set. With these innovative developments, the Metalica pioneered features that would not surface on Pentax production cameras until the Electro-Spotmatic (ES) (automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1971 and K2 (vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter,</b> bayonet lens mount, automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1975.

50|$|Minolta {{continued}} to offer 35 mm manual focus SLR cameras in its X-370, X-570, and X-700 from 1981, but slowly repositioned its cameras {{to appeal to}} a broader market. Minolta decided to abandon the high level of design and parts specifications of its earlier XD/XE line. The new amateur-level X-570, X-700, and related models offered additional program and metering features designed to appeal to newer photographers, at a lower cost. The advanced vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> design of the older cameras was rejected in favor of a cheaper horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, reducing flash sync to a slow 1/60th second. Further cost savings were made internally, where some operating components were changed from metal to plastic. As Minolta's autofocus Maxxums were proving successful, Minolta invested fewer resources in its manual focus line as time progressed.|$|E

He was unarmed and did not oppose arrest. In his bedroom there was an altar dedicated to the Madonna of Polsi, in the municipality of San Luca, where the chiefs of the 'Ndrangheta locali meet regularly during the September Feast.

50|$|The Prescott City Jail is a {{historic}} city jail behind the city hall of Prescott, Arkansas. The modest single-story structure was built for the city in 1912 by the Southern Structural Steel Company. It is built of reinforced concrete, with metal grates covering unglazed window openings, and a doorway that is reinforced with heavy <b>metal</b> <b>shutters.</b> It was built to replace an early jail, from which a suspect involved in the burglary of a prominent citizen's home had escaped, {{in part due to}} its poor condition. This building, housing three cells, served the city until the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Like its predecessor, the FM, the FM2n has {{a long-standing}} {{reputation}} for reliability and durability. It has an extremely strong body of copper-aluminum-silicon (silumin) alloy. [...] The FM2's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The camera's precision-tapered, high-strength vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> blades were fabricated originally of lightweight titanium (later production FM2 shutter blades {{were made of}} aluminum), while the mirror/shutter mechanism rides on self-lubricating bearings. The mirror linkage uses the same mechanism found on Nikon's professional F2, with some modern improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce. The FM2 also features Nikon's famous close tolerance assembly and minimal space lubrication, meaning that it will reliably operate in temperature extremes of −40 °C to +50 °C.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{devised a}} metal-armoured double {{loophole}} {{that would protect}} the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them. Another innovation {{was the use of}} a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper. The papier-mâché figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could [...] "smoke" [...] a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with artillery fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using Kim's Game to train observational skills.|$|E
5000|$|The {{light is}} a third-order Fresnel lens with lenses, prisms and {{mechanism}} manufactured in France in 1853. A larger, second-order light had been planned, but delay in shipment caused the present light, originally {{destined for the}} Fort Point Lighthouse in San Francisco, to be installed instead. The first light source was a whale oil lantern set inside the lens, whose tank the keeper had to climb the tower to fill several times a night. Whale oil was very expensive and was soon replaced by liquified lard oil which gave way to kerosene in 1880. At {{the turn of the}} century, an incandescent vapor lamp was used, followed by electric lights in 1919. From 1912 to 1940 a falling weight mechanism rotated a <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> around the light causing the beam to be cut off to seaward for 10 out of every 30 seconds. Thereafter a timed flasher provided the [...] "on/off" [...] characteristic.|$|E

40|$|In Japan, <b>metal</b> fire <b>shutters</b> {{are used}} {{in all kinds of}} {{buildings}} as fire partition. However, in large spaces with high ceilings and long spans, it has been impossible to use <b>metal</b> fire <b>shutters</b> because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. A system of fire-resistant screens chat can be used to form fire partitions has been developed to meet this need. The performance of this system is equal to that of conventional <b>metal</b> fire <b>shutters.</b> This paper describes experiments and simulations which confirm the system's fire resistance and motional performance. It also describes how this system is applied to a multipurpose gymnasium. ~lRODUCTION It has been impossible to compartmentalize a large space with <b>metal</b> fire <b>shutters</b> or <b>metal</b> fire doors in case of fire up to now because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. Therefore, alternative measures were taken, {{such as the use of}} big water guns, to extinguish fires at an early stage or small areas within a large space to contain smoke and fire, Now, we have developed a fire-resistant screen system, to solve such problems. This system can prevent fire from spreading in a large space, and also enables an open plan without the need for guide studs for fire shutters. This paper outlines this fire-resistant screen system, its fire resistance, and its motional performance. It also introduces an example of a multipurpose gymnasium in which the system was first realized...|$|R
25|$|After another {{incident}} of desecration of the Koran, Kurnaz said that Afghan prisoners tore down a ceiling fan, honed blades, and attacked their captors using the fan blades as swords.

5000|$|The FM3a {{is built}} {{to a high}} level of {{workmanship}} and material quality. It shares the advantages of the FM and the FM2N, both generally regarded as two of the most reliable cameras ever built (both in terms of operation under extreme conditions and in day-to-day reliability reports from repair shops and magazine surveys). It has an extremely strong body of copper silumin alloy. The electronics are well protected within the body and of extremely high quality, including the flexible circuits. The FM3A's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> utilises precision tapered high-strength aluminium alloy blades and oilless self-lubricating bearings. The guide rails are made of stainless steel. The mirror is made of titanium. It is large to reduce chances of vignetting with super-telephotos of up to 800 mm, and uses the same mechanism found on Nikon's pro F2, with some improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce.|$|E
5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to compact cassettes, except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|E
5000|$|Motivated by {{the huge}} success of the low-priced Canon AE-1 and other consumer-level cameras, Minolta {{followed}} suit in the new camera's design by offering {{a wide array of}} optional equipment for the X-700 such as flashes, film winders, motor drives, data backs etc. This had the effect of lowering the budget for the camera's internal mechanism. In a step backwards, the new X-700 was not equipped with the fast vertical <b>metal</b> <b>shutter</b> of previous XE and XD cameras, and was instead fitted with a less expensive horizontal traverse silk shutter, enabling maximum sync speed of 1/60 second, and operated by an electromagnetic shutter release. [...] No mechanical shutter speed was provided, even in bulb mode. The resultant battery drain and inability to meter at light levels below EV-1 made the camera a poor choice for long exposures, as often needed for astrophotography. Minolta further lowered the price of the camera by fabricating certain parts in the film advance and rewind mechanism of less expensive materials, and by the use of less expensive electronic components. Even the rewind lever of the camera is made of plastic.|$|E
