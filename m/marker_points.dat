40|$|At first sight, it is {{not easy}} to {{identify}} the structure and argument of Nativity sermon 191. Augustine does not make explicit the steps he takes in this sermon and, furthermore, the existing arragement into sections (derived from the Maurists' edition) does not correspond to these steps. It is, however, possible to identify the structure and argument on the basis of a relatively quick and easy twofold method, which examines the text for use of language (changes of sentence type, unusual particle order, and uncommon word and/or constituent order) and for use of Scripture (changes in Scriptural texts and/or quotations or clusters of Scriptural references). If the <b>markers</b> <b>pointing</b> to transitions uncovered by analysing the use of language are identical to the <b>markers</b> <b>pointing</b> to transitions uncovered by analysing the use of Scripture, these are <b>markers</b> <b>pointing</b> to transitions between parts of the text. In sermon 191, this method results in a division into three internally coherent parts, in which a central didactic moment is preceded by a preparation and followed by a confirmation. The central didactic moment expresses suggestions that must be adopted if a person is to be able to change his (or her) inner disposition from pride to humility. The information contained in the preparation for the didactic moment sets the hearer on the path towards this moment, while the information contained in the confirmation of the moment inspires the hearer to put its teachings into practice. The division into three parts clarifies the structure of the sermon. This structure cannot be discerned on the basis of the traditional rhetoric rules, which Augustine incidentally also repeats elsewhere (although not without qualifying them). The tripartite division also clarifies the argument. Understanding and recognising this trains a spotlight on the force of Augustine's strategy as a preacher. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tissue-equivalent {{proportional}} counters (TEPCs) measure {{distributions of}} ionizations, {{produced in the}} gas cavity by the radiation field which are afterwards converted into distributions of energy imparted by applying a calibration factor. To calibrate the pulse height spectra, firstly, a <b>marker</b> <b>point</b> must be identified in the measured spectrum. Then, an accurate value of lineal energy must be assigned to this marker. A common marker that is often used for calibration is the so-called proton-edge (p-edge). It is a distinctive feature of a proton or neutron spectrum which corresponds to {{the maximum amount of}} energy that a proton can deposit in the active volume of the detector. A precise method to identify the <b>marker</b> <b>point</b> was applied to identify the p-edge with an uncertainty below 2 %. To evaluate the final uncertainty of the calibration, the uncertainty of the energy value assigned to the p-edge must also be considered.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{technique}} to measure the 3 D motion of <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> along a straight path within an object using x-ray stereo projections. From recordings of two x-ray projections at different angles, the 3 D coordinates of <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> can be determined. By synchronizing the x-ray exposure time to the motion event, a moving marker leaves a trace {{in the image of}} which the gray scale is linearly proportional to the marker velocity. By measuring the marker gray scale along the motion path, the velocity at each point is determined and the position as a function of time is obtained by integration. In combination with the 3 D information from two stereo recordings, the full 3 D motion is obtained. The difference in position between the new method and laser vibrometry was less than 5 mu m. The 3 D motion measurement is performed within seconds, making the method ideal for applications in biomechanics. In combination with a full CT-scan of the object, the motion information on the <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> can be used to measure and visualize how an internal rigid 3 D structure moves.

40|$|A mutiscale {{numerical}} {{approach is}} developed for the inves-tigation of bubbly flows in turbulent environments. This con-sists of two different numerical approaches capable of captur-ing the bubble dynamics at different scales depending upon the relative size of the bubbles compared to the grid resolution: (i) fully resolved simulations (FRS) wherein the bubble dynamics and deformation are completely resolved, and (ii) subgrid, dis-crete bubble model where the bubbles are not resolved by the computational grid. For fully resolved simulations, a novel ap-proach combining a particle-based, mesh-free technique with a finite-volume flow solver, is developed. The approach uses <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> around the interface and advects the signed dis-tance to the interface in a Lagrangian frame. Interpolation kernel based derivative calculations typical of particle methods are used to extract the interface normal and curvature from un-ordered <b>marker</b> <b>points.</b> Unlike front-tracking methods, connec-tivity between the <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> is not necessary. For under-resolved bubbles, a mixture-theory based Eulerian-Lagrangian approach accounting for volumetric displacements due to bubble motion and size variations is developed. The bubble dynamics is modeled by Rayleigh-Plesset equations using an adaptive time-stepping scheme. A detailed verification and validation study of both approaches is performed to test {{the accuracy of the}} method on a variety of single and multiple bubble problems to show good predictive capability.

40|$|The peopling of Comoro Archipelago {{is defined}} by {{successive}} waves of migration from three main areas: the East African Coast (Bantu-speaking populations), the Persia and Arabian Peninsula, and Southeast Asia (especially Indonesia). It follows an apparentclassic trihybrid admixture model. To better understand the Comorian population admixture dynamics, we analyzed the contributions of these three historical parental components to its genetic pool. To enhance accuracy and reliability, we used both classical and molecular markers. Samples consist of published data: blood group frequencies, 14 KIR genes, 19 mitochondrial DNA SNPs (to highlight female migrations), 14 Y chromosome SNPs (male migrations). We revealed distinct admixture patterns for autosomal and uniparental markers. KIR gene frequencies had never been used to estimate admixture rates, this being a first assessment of their informative power in admixture studies. To avoid major methodological and statistical bias, we determined admixture coefficients through nine well-tried estimators and their associated software programs (ADMIX 95, ADMIX, admix 2. 0, LEA, LEADMIX, and Mistura). Results from mtDNA and Y chromosome <b>markers</b> <b>point</b> to an important sex-bias in the admixture event.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the front-tracking method using <b>marker</b> <b>points</b> for the numerical solution {{of a class}} of moving boundary problems, which arise in connection with certain two-dimensional electrochemical machining problems.

The system has been analysed, in some cases, {{with respect to the}} local stability of equilibrium solutions and to the global stability of nonequilibrium solutions. The linearised local stability of the equilibrium solution is investigated in terms of the Jacobi matrix for the system of ODES. Closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Jacobi matrix have been derived. Part of the method comprises the solution of a Dirichlet boundary value problem. This is carried out using various boundary collocation methods, which are investigated. The mathematical-numerical model has features which are in accordance with those of the physical problem. This has also been demonstrated by actual computation of some examples...|$|E

By synchronizing the x-ray exposure time to the motion event, a moving marker leaves a trace {{in the image of}} which the gray scale is linearly proportional to the marker velocity. From the gray scale along the motion path, the 3 D motion (velocity) is obtained. The path of motion was reconstructed and compared with the applied waveform. The results showed that the accuracy is in order of 5 %. The difference of displacement amplitude between the new method and laser vibrometry was less than 5 mu m. We demonstrated the method on the malleus ossicle motion in the gerbil middle ear as a function of pressure applied on the eardrum. The new method has the advantage over existing methods such as laser vibrometry that the structures under study {{do not need to be}} visually exposed.
