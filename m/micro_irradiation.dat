50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{brothers}} realized a UV laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> instrument {{which for the}} first time made it possible to irradiate in a controlled manner only a tiny part of a living cell at the absorption maximum for DNA (257 nm). This replaced the conventional UV partial irradiation practiced for over 60 years. In this way, it was possible {{for the first time}} to induce alterations in the DNA in a focused manner (i.e. at predetermined places in the cell nucleus of living cells) without compromising the cells ability to divide and to survive. Specific very small cell regions could be irradiated and thus the dynamics of macromolecules (DNA) contained there quantitatively estimated. Furthermore, due to the high speed of the process using irradiation times of fractions of a second, it became possible to irradiate even moving cell organelles. This development provided the basis for important experiments in the area of genome structure research (establishing the existence of so-called chromosome territories in living mammalian cells) and led, a few years later (1979/1980) to a successful collaboration with the biologist Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen). In this collaboration Cremer used his UV laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> equipment to elicit cellular changes in the early larval stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experience}} gained in the construction and application of the UV laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object {{by means of a}} focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes. It is this plan {{for the construction of a}} confocal laser scanning microscope (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with fluorescent markers that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the University of Amsterdam and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and biomedical laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three-dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade an {{increasing}} number of reports are published in which UV laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> (UVLM) is used as a new tool to generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in localized regions within single nuclei [1]. Until then only heavy ions (HI) were known for their ability to induce DSBs in strictly localized areas of cell nuclei [2], but compared to UVLM systems the experimental handling is less comfortable. UVLM systems combine high magnification imaging with precise laser irradiation, thus, allowing the observation of early repair proteins in a sub-second timescale and a sub-micrometer resolution [3]. These advantages combined with the low costs compared to HI experiments make UVLM systems a tempting choice in the research field of DNA repair. Our aim is the characterisation of UVLM system...|$|E

The reactions af- forded corresponding Nitro derivatives in very good yield with high regioselectivity. The results obtained in non-conventional methods (<b>Micro</b> wave <b>irradiation,</b> Grinding, Sonication) are comparable with those ob- tained under conventional conditions, but the reaction times of former conditions are substantially shorter than that of the latter...|$|R

40|$|Silver Nanoparticles {{are applied}} in various fields {{due to its}} anti {{bacterial}} properties. A conventional method for synthesis of AgNP requires dangerous chemical and {{large amount of energy}} is released in the process. Environmental friendly techniques are adopted for the synthesis of nanoparticles of silver. The present research work summarizes the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles by using leaf extract of Ficus Elastica and alternative energy sources <b>micro</b> wave <b>irradiation.</b> The synthesized Nanoparticles are characterized by uv- visible spectroscopy and by SEM. The synthesized nanoparticles are applied for controlling SO 2 and NO 2 from aqueous solution of SO 2 and NO 2. Batch adsorption studies are carried out. The effect of the temperature on adsorption of aqueous solution is studied at different temperature. A comparison of kinetic models applied to the adsorption of on silver Nanoparticles was evaluated for the pseudo first order, pseudo second order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models respectively. Results show that pseudo second order model was found to correlate the experimental data. Data fitted perfectly into and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{architecture}} is a biological {{field of research}} that studies the spatio-temporal organization of the components within cell nuclei. Since nuclei are the organelles that harbor the genome and epigenome, they are the place {{where most of the}} genetic processes like replication, transcription, splicing, gene-regulation, DNA repair, re- combination etc. are carried out. In the presented doctoral thesis modern 4 D live-cell microscopy in combination with laser or ion microbeam irradiation (to label or damage chromatin, respectively) was used to study nuclear architecture in living cells over extended periods of time at the single cell level. The results presented in this thesis can be partitioned into three main parts: (a) chromatin dynamics in cycling cells, (b) adaptation of the ion micro beam facil- ity SNAKE to the needs of live-cell observation (including first experiments) and (c) exploring spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA repair proteins after laser micro ir- radiation. (A) Chromatin dynamics in cycling cells Distribution of interphase chromosomes within cell nuclei {{has been found to be}} non- random with respect to gene density and chromosome size. Changes in nuclear orga- nization have been reported in several disorders and diseases. To which extent relative chromosome positioning is conserved through mitosis in cycling cells and whether certain chromatin domains are able change their relative position dramatically in the interphase nucleus has been the subject of various mechanistic models and contro- versial discussions. In 1909 German biologist theodor Boveri was the first one to comment on this topic in his publication: “Die Blastomerenkerne von Ascaris mega- locephala und die Theorie der Chromosomenindividualität” (included as an appendix to this thesis). In order to test Boveri’s hypotheses, 4 D live-cell observations were carried out on a modern spinning disc confocal microscope using a human cell line that possesses photoactivatable chromatin. In experiments that used photoactivation and photobleaching of chromatin, it could be demonstrated that – as stated by Boveri – chromatin proximity relationships are in general not conserved through mitosis but destroyed during early prometaphase by the mechanics of mitosis. Other experiments showed that nuclear rotations in a conveyer-belt-like manner are able to bring initially distant chromatin domains into close proximity in a matter of a few minutes. (B) Adaptation of the SNAKE micro beam facility to the needs of live- cell microscopy (including first experiments) Since ordinary irradiation sources lack the ability to perform targeted micro irradia- tion at the micrometer scale and laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> produces an artificial mix of various DNA damages, the ion microbeam SNAKE represents an interesting tool to explore the dynamics of repair proteins in a spatio-temporal context. In the course of a collaboration project the ion microbeam was adapted to the needs of long-term live-cell microscopy. These adaptations and first live-cell experiments performed at the refurbished ion micro beam are described in this part of the results. (C) Exploring spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA repair proteins after laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Mutation of genetic information can cause serious harm to a cell or even a whole or- ganism. DNA repair serves to protect and clean the genome from undirected poten- tially hazardous changes. Compared to the wealth of information which is available about DNA repair at the molecular level only little attention has been payed to it in context of nuclear architecture. In the last part of the results cells stably expressing GFP tagged versions of the repair proteins MDC 1, Rad 52 and 53 BP 1 were damaged by laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> and imaged over extended periods of time. It could be de- monstrated that at the used damage induction conditions most of the cells show only minor changes with respect to localization of damage signals, kinetochores and nu- cleoli pattern over time. Furthermore, disappearance of spontaneous 53 BP 1 -GFP foci in favor of protein recruitment to damaged chromatin and mutual exclusion between kinetochore signals and Rad 52 -GFP damage foci could be observed. In a few U 2 OS Rad 52 -GFP nuclei DNA damage foci disappeared simultaneously after a dramatic phase in which the total number of foci drastically increased – even adjacent to the laser damaged chromatin...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of PARP- 1 disruption or inhibition on DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR) and radio-induced lethality were determined in synchronized, isogenic HeLa cells stably silenced or not for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) (PARP- 1 KD) or XRCC 1 (XRCC 1 KD). PARP- 1 inhibition prevented XRCC 1 -YFP recruitment at sites of 405 [*]nm laser <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation,</b> slowed SSBR 10 -fold and triggered {{the accumulation of}} large persistent foci of GFP-PARP- 1 and GFP-PCNA at photo damaged sites. These aggregates are presumed to hinder the recruitment of other effectors of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. PARP- 1 silencing also prevented XRCC 1 -YFP recruitment but did not lengthen the lifetime of GFP-PCNA foci. Moreover, PARP- 1 KD and XRCC 1 KD cells in S phase completed SSBR as rapidly as controls, while SSBR was delayed in G 1. Taken together, the data demonstrate that a PARP- 1 - and XRCC 1 -independent SSBR pathway operates when the short patch repair branch of the BER is deficient. Long patch repair is the likely mechanism, as GFP-PCNA recruitment at photo-damaged sites was normal in PARP- 1 KD cells. PARP- 1 silencing elicited hyper-radiosensitivity, while radiosensitization by a PARP inhibitor reportedly occurs only in those cells treated in S phase. PARP- 1 inhibition and deletion thus have different outcomes in terms of SSBR and radiosensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The Gray Cancer Institute has {{pioneered the}} use of X ray {{focussing}} techniques to develop systems for micro irradiating individual cells and sub cellular targets in vitro. Cellular <b>micro</b> <b>irradiation</b> is now recognised as a highly versatile technique for understanding how ionising radiation interacts with living cells and tissues. The strength of the technique lies {{in its ability to}} deliver precise doses of radiation to selected individual cells (or sub cellular targets). The application of this technique in the field of radiation biology continues to be of great interest for investigating a number of phenomena currently of concern to the radiobiological community. One important phenomenon is the so called ‘bystander effect’ where it is observed that unirradiated cells can also respond to signals transmitted by irradiated neighbours. Clearly, the ability of a microbeam to irradiate just a single cell or selected cells within a population is well suited to studying this effect. Our prototype ‘tabletop’ X-ray microprobe was optimised for focusing 278 eV C-K X rays and has been used successfully for a number of years. However, we have sought to develop a new variable energy soft X-ray microprobe capable of delivering focused CK (0. 28 keV), Al-K (1. 48 keV) and notably, Ti-K (4. 5 keV) X rays. Ti-K X rays are capable of penetrating several cell layers and are therefore much better suited to studies involving tissues and multi cellular layers. In our new design, X-rays are generated by the focussed electron bombardment of a material whose characteristic-K radiation is required. The source is mounted on a 1. 5 x 1. 0 metre optical table. Electrons are generated by a custom built gun, designed to operate up to 15 kV. The electrons are focused using a permanent neodymium iron boron magnet assembly. Focusing is achieved by adjusting the accelerating voltage and by fine tuning the target position via a vacuum position feedthrough. To analyze the electron beam properties, a custom built microscope is used to image the focussed beam on the target, through a vacuum window. The X-rays are focussed by a zone plate optical assembly mounted {{to the end of a}} hollow vertical tube that can be precisely positioned above the X ray source. The cell finding and positioning stage comprises an epi-fluorescence microscope and a feedback controlled 3 axis cell positioning stage, also mounted on the optical table. Independent vertical micro positioning of the microscope objective turret allows the focus of the microscope and the X ray focus to coincide in space (i. e. at the point where the cell should be positioned for exposure). The whole microscope stage assembly can be precisely raised or lowered, to cater for large differences in the focal length of the X ray zone plates. The facility is controlled by PC and the software provides full status and control of the source and makes use of a dual-screen for control and display during the automated cell finding and irradiation procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and development efforts on the silica (SiO 2) optical fiber for application in radiation sensing and other dosimetry field have become quite active. The widely used LiF based dosimeter (TLD) has shown a relatively low reproducibility {{and there is a}} time delay in dose assessment which loses its capability as direct real-time dose assessment dosimeters unlike diodes. The macroscopic size of the optical fiber generally does not allow direct in vivo dose sensing in the inner organ for radiotherapy and medical imaging. A flat optical fiber (FF) with nominal dimensions of (0. 08 x 10 x 10) mm 3 of pure silica SiO 2 and GeO 2 with Boron doped silica fiber SiO 2 was selected for this research. The Germanium was used a dopant to enhance the flat optical fiber to reach much higher responsiveness and dose sensitivity in high energy and high dose irradiation. Together with this combination, both TLD dimension and dose assessment issues was hoped to be overcome. The research conducted by comparing the response of pure silica SiO 2 flat optical fiber with a GeO 2 with Boron doped silica SiO 2 flat optical fiber. The FF sample was annealed at 400 °C for one hour before irradiated. Kinetic parameters and dosimetric glow curve of TL response and sensitivity were studied with respect to the electron beam of high dose of <b>micro</b> beam <b>irradiation</b> of 1. 0 kGy, 5. 0 kGy, 10. 0 kGy, 50. 0 kGy, 100. 0 kGy, 500. 0 kGy, and 1. 0 MGy using Singapore Synchrotron Light Source's (PCIT) beamline...|$|R
