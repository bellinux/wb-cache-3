40|$|SF 6 /CHF 3 plasma-induced {{damage in}} AlGa 1 As (x = 0. 30, 0. 15) and its repair by {{annealing}} were investigated and {{compared with that}} for GaAs. All samples had higher sheet resistances after plasma exposure. The effect of annealing on plasma damage depended upon the Al mole fraction of the <b>material</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> Damage in AlGa 1 _As (x = 0. 30, 0. 15) was increased by a 300 °C anneal, while that in GaAs remained unchanged. Damage in AlGa 1 _As (x = 0. 3 (J) was also increased after 450 °C annealing, while that in AlGai_rAs (x = 0. 15) and GaAs was repaired by the anneal. The increased resistiv-ity in A 1 GaAs after annealing is mainly due to further carrier reduction by magnification of the damaged region. Considering the similar effects of annealing on SF 6 /CHF 3 and He plasma-exposed A 1 GaAs, the increased sheet resistance after the anneal is though {{to be affected by}} incorporated low-mass ions, such as He and H disso-ciated from CHFa. The 4. 2 K FL measurements revealed a new spectral peak near 1. 70 eV only in the spectrum of the postexposure-annealed sample. The peak intensities for the SF 6 /CHF 3 and He plasma-exposed sample were more prominent than that for the SF 6 plasma. These results suggest that in-diffusion of point defects induced by light ions brings about the further carrier reduction in the damaged A 1 GaAs upon anneal. We speculate that the different effects of annealing on damage in AlGa 1 _As (x = 0. 30, 0. 15) are related to behavior of point defects upon annealing. To elucidate the mechanism for Al mole frac-tion dependence on this effect, further investigation on behaviors of defects and deep levels upon annealing will be necessary. Acknowledgmen...|$|R

This will help us to identify common approaches for real-time shading systems and to acquire information about feature sets required for this kind of system. The shading algorithms we will look at fall into three categories: realistic materials for local and global illumination, shadow mapping, and finally bump mapping algorithms. 1 Realistic Materials In this section we describe techniques for a variety of different reflection models to the computation of local illumination in hardware-based rendering. Rather than replacing the standard Phong model by another single, fixed model, we seek a method that allows us to utilize a wide variety of different models so that the most appropriate model can be chosen for each application. 1. 1 Arbitrary BRDFs for Local Illumination We will first consider the case of local illumination, i. e. light that arrives at objects directly from the light sources.

40|$|The growing {{effort to}} reduce vehicle weight and improve passive safety in the {{automotive}} industry has drastically increased the demand for {{ultra high strength steel}} components. There exist several production methods for such components, where the press hardening technique (hot stamping) {{is one of the most}} successful in producing complex components from boron steel. In order to accurately perform numerical Finite Element (FE) simulations of the actual thermo-mechanical forming, it is crucial to use correct material data and models. This work is focusing on two main aspects of the <b>material</b> characterisation <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> The first is the flow stress of the austenite at elevated temperatures and different strain rates, relevant for the process, which is crucial for correctly predicting the strains in the component and the forming force. During a press hardening cycle, the actual forming is performed at high temperatures and the steel is in the austenitic state. The second, the austenite decomposition into daughter products such as ferrite, pearlite, bainite or martensite is a function of the thermal and mechanical history. To find the mechanical response (flow stress) for the austenite, a method based on multiple overlapping continuous cooling and compression tests (MOCCCT) in combination with inverse modelling has been developed. A validation test (in combination with the compression tests) shows good agreement with the simulated forming force, indicating that the estimated flow stress as a function of temperature, strain and strain rate is accurate in the actual application. The austenite decomposition model is developed and integrated <b>as</b> a <b>material</b> subroutine into the FE-code LS-DYNA. The model is based on the combined nucleation and growth rate equations proposed by Kirkaldy.

Includes bibliographical references. vii, 49 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAlphaflex, {{an impact}} {{modifier}} for elastomers and thermoplastics, has been compounded with High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). The physical {{properties of the}} modified plastic were tested {{to see if the}} new material is physically and economically viable to be used as the cold water pipe material in OTEC applications. The main area of research conducted on the cold water pipe material was determining the effect of enhancement of HDPE with Alphaflex on hoop strength of the pipe. The effects realized were then analyzed for physical and economic viability for various ocean thermal energy conversion and seawater district cooling scenarios. All physical properties of the Alphaflex enhanced material tested exhibited favorable results when compared to HDPE.

Scenarios that require long pipes or supply small loads without room for expansion do not offer as great an advantage and in some cases are not able to meet economic expectations under the current production costs of Alphaflex.
