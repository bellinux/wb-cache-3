5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E

40|$|A new {{mechanical}} {{technique for}} polishing the inside surface of niobium superconducting RF (SRF) cavities has been developed. <b>Mirror-like</b> <b>finishes,</b> the smoothest observed in cavities so far, were produced after fine polishing, with < 15 nm RMS roughness over 1 mm{sup 2 } scan area. This is {{an order of}} magnitude less than the typical roughness produced by electropolishing. The processing equipment has advantages of modest installed and operating costs, simple associated technology, and no large quantities of acutely toxic chemicals or special handling procedures. Cavity quality factors above 10 {sup 10 } were maintained well above the 35 MV m{sup - 1 } benchmark for electropolished cavities, and this was achieved with an intermediate finish not as smooth as the final polish. Repair of a weld defect, which is intrinsic to this process, was also demonstrated. These transformational aspects could enable a new SRF cavity processing paradigm for future large scale particle accelerators such as the International Linear Collider...|$|R

5000|$|In {{this letter}} type, {{the face of}} the letter is {{constructed}} from aluminum and the lighting is directed to the back. This light floods the wall that the letter is mounted to and creates a negative space at night. Letters in this style are also called halo letters. It is usually the most expensive form to manufacture. LEDs are installed to the inside back of the can, and the back is often fitted with a clear or translucent plastic back to diffuse the light and protect the lighting elements and wiring. The letters are typically mounted 1-1/2" [...] from the wall so they are set off from the façade of the building. The inside of the can is often painted white to reflect light. The effect of the halo lighting allows for a variety of creative effects depending on the color, sheen, and texture of the building surface.

40|$|Surface {{treatment}} {{remained a}} key solution to numerous problems of synthetic hard tissues. The basic methods of implant surface modification include various {{physical and chemical}} deposition techniques. However, most of these techniques have several drawbacks such as excessive cost and surface cracks and require very high sintering temperature. Additive mixed-electric discharge machining (AM-EDM) is an emerging technology which simultaneously acts as a machining and surface modification technique. Aside from the mere molds, dies, and tool fabrication, AM-EDM is materializing to finishing of automobiles and aerospace, nuclear, and biomedical components, through the concept of material migrations. The mechanism of material transfer by AM-EDM resembles electrophoretic deposition, whereby the additives in the AM-EDM dielectric fluids are melted and migrate to the machined surface, forming a <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finishing</b> characterized by extremely hard, nanostructured, and nanoporous layers. These layers promote the bone in-growth and strengthen the cell adhesion. Implant shaping and surface treatment through AM-EDM are becoming a key research focus in recent years.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finished</b> cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the mating surface roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the mating surface roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the mating surface roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material. In addition, depending on the mating surface roughness, significant differences in the surface roughness of coated roller and depth of flaking on the coated roller were found...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} impact {{of a wide range of}} {{operating}} parameters upon 304 stainless steel (SS) dissolution in sodium nitrate (NaNO{sub 3 }) electrolyte, the staff of Engineering Science Applications-Energy and Process Engineering performed a series of beaker experiments. The variables that the authors explored included NaNO{sub 3 } concentration, chromate concentration, pH, stirring rate, and current density. They adjusted the run length to obtain approximately 10 mg/cm{sup 2 } metal removal so that they could compare surface finishes under similar test conditions. Key findings may be summarized as follows. Current efficiency during dissolution depends most strongly upon current density and electrolyte concentration. At 0. 05 A/cm{sup 2 }, current density is more dependent upon chromium concentration than they previously thought. They obtained the best surface finish in a classical electropolishing regime at current densities above 1. 5 A/cm{sup 2 }. <b>Mirror-like</b> <b>finishes</b> were obtained at near 100 % current efficiency. At 0. 05 a/cm{sup 2 } they obtained reasonable surface finishes, particularly at lower electrolyte concentration. Current efficiency was low (30 %). At intermediate current densities, they obtained the worst surface finishes, that is, surfaces with severe pitting. Also, they explored preferential attack of the weld zone during electrodissolution of 304 stainless steel cans. Electrodissolution removed approximately twice as much material from cans with unshielded weld zones as from cans with shielded weld zones. The following implications are apparent. While operation above 1 A/cm{sup 2 } yields the best surface finish at 100 % current efficiency, equipment size and power feedthrough limitations reduce the attractiveness of this option. Because other Los Alamos researchers, obtained more favorable results with the sulfate electrolyte, the authors recommend no further work for the sodium nitrate electrolyte system...|$|R
500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the <b>mirror-like,</b> high-gloss <b>finish</b> sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations.

With this practice of constantly redesigning, along with the closed-loop process control system, LPB has been shown to produce a maximum compression of 12mm, although the average is around 1-7+mm. LPB has even been shown {{to have the ability to}} produce through-thickness compression in blades and vanes, greatly increasing their damage tolerance over 10-fold, effectively mitigating most FOD and reducing inspection requirements. No material is removed during this process, even when correcting corrosion damage.

40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finished</b> silicon die of the IC. Grinding, lapping and/or polishing operations are required to get such a smooth surface. Precision grinding in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (precision jig grinder) facilitated the diamond grinding. Special fixtures were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost <b>mirror-like).</b> A honed <b>finish</b> provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with impact tools varying in coarseness. A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. A thermal (or flamed) finish produces a textured, nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame. This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.|$|R

Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites ("glair"), gum, and/or Armenian bole as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added {{to make them more}} flexible.|$|E
50|$|Chrome plating is a {{finishing}} treatment using the electrolytic deposition of chromium. The {{most common form}} of chrome plating is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10-&#181;m layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finish</b> to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000&#160;µm, are called hard chrome and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear.|$|E
40|$|Polishing {{of silicon}} {{is a major}} process seen in microelectronic and optical industries. As <b>mirror-like</b> surface <b>finish</b> is an {{essential}} factor that influences the performance of electronic and optical products, it has been believed that the fixture in finite element does play a role to produce such a quality surface on silicon. This paper centers on designing the fixture in finite element environment for polishing of silicon. Polishing process was virtually developed using general purpose FE codes. Process model consist of major components needed for polishing such as the base plate, the pad, the abrasive, silicon and of course of fixture. Currently only 2 D model was considered because {{of the complexity of}} the process and limitation of the FE code. Fixed diamond abrasive proposed by VTT microelectronics was created in FE model to overcome the modeling difficulty of loose abrasives, to conveniently define polishing forces involved, and also investigated the effectiveness of the new abrasive design. Polishing forces were split into two-normal and tangential forces. The presence of micron-size diamond abrasive was modeled by defining friction coefficient at the interface between silicon and abrasive sheet. Typical values of polishing forces were defined as recommended by manufacturer. Finer mesh was designed at the top layer of the silicon in order to simulate the action of the diamond abrasive realistically. Polishing process was simulated by changing the various fixture designs. The goodness of the fixture design was justified by absence of high stress concentration in anywhere in the silicon...|$|R
30|$|High-purity {{aluminum}} foils (Al 99.999 %, Goodfellow, Coraopolis, PA, USA) were firstly cleaned {{by means}} of ultrasonication in isopropanol and ethanol for 5 min. Afterwards, the Al foils were placed into the anodization cell and electropolished up to a <b>mirror-like</b> <b>finishing</b> in a vigorously stirred mixture of perchloric acid and ethanol (25 : 75 vol.%) at 5 °C, with an applied voltage of 20 V measured versus a Pt counter electrode. The Al substrates were then pre-anodized under mild anodization conditions at 80 V for 10 min in a 0.3 M oxalic acid aqueous solution containing 5 vol.% of ethanol at a temperature between 0 °C and 3 °C. Afterwards, the anodization voltage was increased at 0.08 V s− 1 to reach potentiostatic conditions in the HA process, which was carried out at 140 V for 1.5 h. After the HA process, H-AAO membranes were released from the unoxidized Al substrate, which was removed by wet chemical etching in a CuCl 2 /HCl aqueous solution, and the membranes were subsequently immersed for 2.5 h in 5 wt.% H 3 PO 4 at 30 °C in order to remove the alumina barrier layer {{at the bottom of}} the pores, also increasing the pore size of the H-AAO membranes. This last chemical etching step also results in a complete dissolution of the protective mild anodization AAO layer on the top of the H-AAO membranes due to its lower chemical resistance to phosphoric acid etching compared to the H-AAO layer. Thus, the pores of the resulting H-AAO membrane are fully opened at both sides. Afterwards, the membranes were coated with a protective SiO 2 conformal layer of 2 nm in thickness, deposited by ALD at 150 °C from aminopropyltriethoxysilane (100 °C), water (RT), and ozone (RT) that were employed as precursors and oxidant agent, respectively [23, 24]. The back side of the H-AAO templates was coated {{by means of}} sputtering and further electrodeposition of a continuous gold layer, which serves as a working electrode in the subsequent electrodeposition process of multisegments of Co-Ni alloy. Multisegmented Co 54 Ni 46 /Co 85 Ni 15 nanowire arrays were electrochemically grown from a Watts-type bath containing 0.36 M CoSO 4, 0.04 M CoCl 2, 0.76 M NiSO 4, 0.13 M NiCl 2, and 0.73 M H 3 BO 3. The pH of the electrolyte was adjusted to a value of 4 to 4.2 by adding 1 M NaOH. Electrodeposition processes were carried out at 35 °C under potentiostatic conditions in a three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a 3 M KCl, an insoluble Pt mesh counter electrode, and the gold-coated H-AAO template acting as the working electrode. The composition of each individual segment of the multisegmented Co 54 Ni 46 /Co 85 Ni 15 nanowire arrays was tuned by adjusting the deposition potential in the range between − 0.8 and − 1.4 V versus the reference electrode. The duration of the potentiostatic deposition pulses was adjusted accordingly with the estimated deposition rate at each potential in order to obtain longitudinal segments of around 300 to 400 nm in length for each Co-Ni single segment. After the Co-Ni electrodeposition process, gold caps of about 2 μm in length were deposited in the upper part of the nanowires for protecting them from corrosion.|$|R
40|$|The dry and near-dry {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) processes are investigated in this research. Dry EDM uses gas to replace the liquid dielectric fluid in conventional EDM. Near-dry EDM applies liquid-gas mixture as the dielectric fluid. The EDM milling configuration is used to supply the dielectric fluid through a rotary tubular tool electrode. The process is capable to achieve both high material removal rate (MRR) and fine surface finish. Experimental investigation is conducted to achieve high MRR for rough machining. Effect of process parameters, including electrode material, dielectric fluid and discharge parameters are investigated. The oxygen-assisted dry EDM is proved capable to provide high MRR (39 mm 3 /min) and low tool wear. The mechanism of the enhanced MRR is attributed to the rapid exothermic oxidation stimulated by the oxygen environment and high discharge energy density. The dry and near-dry EDM milling is exploited for the finishing process. The effects of different dielectric fluids, electrode materials and discharge parameters are investigated. Efforts are made to realize a <b>mirror-like</b> surface <b>finish</b> (0. 09 µm Ra). Key factors and observations during the ultra fine finishing EDM are discussed.

The CV was recorded in N 2 -purged 0.1  M of HClO 4 at a scan rate of 50  mV s− 1 between − 0.2 and 0.8  V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Before recording the CV, the catalyst surface was electrochemically cleaned by rapid scan rate (200  mV s− 1) for 50 cycles between − 0.2 and 0.8  V (vs. Ag/AgCl). After CV measurements, ORR was subsequently performed in the same potential range in O 2 -saturated 0.1  M HClO 4. The processes were repeated {{at least three times}} to ensure repeatability of the data. All the electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature.|$|E
