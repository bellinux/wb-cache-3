5|$|Treatment for {{antifreeze}} poisoning {{needs to}} be started as soon after ingestion as possible to be effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival. Cats <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> within 8â€“12 hours of ingestion. Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars {{to piece together the}} exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E

5000|$|It is in {{this regard}} Articles 12 EC and 17 EC settled {{case-law}} that the principle of non-discrimination requires that comparable situations <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> differently and that different situations <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in the same way. Such treatment may be justified {{only if it is}} based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and is proportionate to the objective being legitimately pursued.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> or cured.|$|E

5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E
