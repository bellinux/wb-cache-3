50|$|Instead of an {{electrostatic}} field {{we can also}} use a magnetic field to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion, and to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest magnetic lens is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil, and gets weaker as we move away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an electrostatic lens, the paths in a magnetic lens contain a spiraling component, i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a magnetic lens is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an electrostatic lens. The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>material)</b> magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties, and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses.|$|E

In {{the absence of a}} magnetic field, as the content of the filler is increased, the degree of swelling tends to increase for the gels containing strontium ferrite and to decrease for the magnetite-containing gels. In the structure of hydrogels, strontium ferrite particles possessing a permanent magnetic moment form a microscopic network from chain aggregates, while the particles of magnetite, a <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>material,</b> give rise to disordered aggregates.

40|$|Traditional {{magnetic}} {{data storage}} devices are reaching {{the limits of}} their capabilities,and new technologies must be sought if the remarkable pace of improvement in performance and storage capacity seen over the last 60 years is to continue. Bit-patterned media (BPM) has the potential to continue this development and significantly increase the storage densities of magnetic hard disks, but developing a cost-effective route to manufacture this technology has so far remained elusive. This work takes inspiration from nature, to develop a bioinspired and green approach to forming magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on surfaces, as a novel approach to BPM. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) form highly uniform MNPs of the magnetic material of magnetite inside specialised lipid organelles called magnetosomes, under mild aqueous conditions. Control over the magnetite crystal formed is exerted through the use of biomineralisation proteins. One of these proteins from the MTB Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1, termed Mms 6, has been shown to control the formation of magnetite nanoparticles in vitro. In this work, {{a modified version of the}} Mms 6 protein, engineered to contain an N-terminal cysteine, is patterned and immobilised onto gold surfaces to biotemplate the growth of MNP arrays of magnetite. Furthermore, different patterning methods are explored to control the location of Mms 6, with the aim of producing MNP arrays that are suitable for BPM. Magnetite is a <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>material</b> that is unlikely to ever be used for data storage, but Mms 6 has been shown to biotemplate the magnetically harder material of cobalt-doped magnetite and this is also explored as an alternative. This approach is also highly adaptable, and could be used for the production of a wide range of different nanomaterials on surfaces through the use of alternative biomolecules. The patterning approaches developed in this work are also used to pattern artificial biomolecules to biotemplate materials that are more technologically relevant and not found in nature, such as L 10 phase CoPt, as a route to developing an environmentally friendly, scalable and bioinspired approach to the challenge of BPM...|$|E
40|$|Some issues {{relating}} to usage of magnetoelectric generator type transducers as the means of measuring intense dynamic loads and as a sensitive element of fuse contact target sensor (CTS) are considered. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the magnetoanisotropic transducer (MAT), the principle of operation of which is based on the change of the magnetic field form caused by the applied mechanical load leading to the appearance of EMF in the output winding. The MAT, especially monolithic, has such advantages as high strength, reliability, endurance and design simplicity. The functional transducer schemes have been analyzed {{and for the first time}} it was shown that there is a possibility of using a version with only one output winding arranged in the magnetic conductor made of <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>material</b> such as structural steel. A mathematical model of transducer is proposed showing that the input signal formed by the external load is proportional to its derivative. With a sufficiently large time constant of the electric circuit and the implementation of a number of additional conditions the transducer may function as an integrator. By that it becomes possible to measure the parameters of dynamic processes having the duration of a few to tens of microseconds. Unlike the traditional transducers such as piezoelectric the output signal is not “masked” by the natural oscillations. The mechanism of the generator effect was considered leading to the “piezomagnetodynamic” model, which includes a number of phenomenological parameters. Some corresponding experimentally derived hysteresis curves are presented. Their vertical shift quantifies the generator effect and does not depend on the intensity of the magnetic field. As an example of practical application of the MAT some results of evaluation of the dynamic force characteristic of the heading part of a piezoelectric fuse are presented. The MAT was also used for the evaluation of back effects of the bullet-proof vest exposed to the impact of indenter. The results can be used in developing of new CTS and sensors (force-meters) for measuring the parameters of intense dynamic loads of short duration. The content of further research is to develop a stricter mathematical model of the transducer and the generator effect. </p...|$|E

The existence of soft magnetic properties in combination with strong magneto-mechanical coupling makes these materials attractive for sensor applications. Our findings show that FeNi deposited with Mo or Al yields <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> and that depositing with B further increases the softness. The out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of FeNi thin films is reduced by depositing with Al and completely removed by depositing with B.

Design/methodology/approach: In this research the arc-plasma deposition of Nd 2 Fe 14 B powders onto a substrate either cooled with water or heated up to a temperature in the range from 773 to 1023 K was applied. In the second method the suction of an arc-melted alloy to a water-cooled copper mould (the suction-casting method) was introduced. Moreover, microstructure, magnetic properties and domain structure of the produced samples were determined. Findings: It has been found that thin Nd 2 Fe 14 B strips obtained by the plasma method possess magnetic properties. It has also been demonstrated that the suction-casting method makes it possible to obtain both amorphous <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g. Fe-Co-W-Zr-B), as well as magnetically hard nanocomposites (e. g. (Fe-Co) -(Pr-Dy) -B-Zr). Research limitations/implications: The main problem in the suction-casting method is to reduce the critical cooling rate required for the production of amorphous alloys and to increase the geometrical dimensions of amorphous specimens. Practical implications: Thin-layered Nd-Fe-B magnets produced by means of arc-plasma deposition can be applied directly onto the surface of electromagnetic equipment parts. Magnets with isotropic magnetic properties were obtained by applying layers onto the water-cooled copper substrate. Whereas, anisotropic magnets were obtained {{as a result of the}} arc-plasma deposition of powders onto the copper substrate heated up to 873 K. The most advantageous properties were achieved for the microcrystalline structure of a grain size close to the single-domain particle size (approx. 0. 3 μm).

However, the nanocrystallisation process {{is known to be}} strongly influenced by the microstructure present in the precursor materials, which may differ considerably between batches due to the natural variability in the planar flow casting process used for its production. This work therefore investigates the origin of this variability and the effect that different processing parameters have on the final microstructure and magnetic softness for a nanocrystalline Fe₈₂. ₅B₁₄Si₂Cu₁. ₅ alloy. It is found that the ribbon geometry and the casting substrate speed both strongly influence the magnetic softness after nanocrystallisation and that by closely controlling these parameters the variability between batches may be reduced. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that variations in the ribbon-substrate contact and ribbon geometry may lead to significant fluctuations in the cooling rate experienced by different regions within an as-cast ribbon and that this might lead to an inhomogeneous microstructure. Therefore, these findings suggest that by tailoring the substrate speed and ribbon geometry for a given composition, {{it may be possible to}} achieve a far larger and more consistent cooling rate than that currently achievable by planar flow casting. It is known that a substantial field induced anisotropy has the potential to degrade magnetic softness in nanocrystalline materials at small grain sizes. Therefore, the size and origin of a field induced anisotropy located within the crystalline phase of an Fe-rich, Si-poor Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline alloy is also investigated. It is seen that a substantial field induced anisotropy exists within the crystalline phase of a Fe-B-(Si) -Cu alloy system and that this may negatively impact its magnetic softness. It is also found that a small uniaxial lattice distortion exists within the crystalline phase after field annealing for nanocrystalline Fe₉₄₋ₓNb₆Bₓ (x = 10, 12 and 14). The size of this lattice distortion is shown to agree well with predictions made by the magnetoelastic model and that this is the likely origin of the field induced anisotropy seen to exist in Si-free Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline alloys. Therefore, with this new understanding it may now be possible to develop novel methods for the control or removal of field induced anisotropies from nanocrystalline Fe-rich materials which may potentially improve their soft magnetic properties...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform the {{detailed}} numerical analysis of remagnetization processes in nanocomposite magnetic materials consisting of magnetically hard grains (i. e. grains {{made of a}} material with a high magnetocrystalline anisotropy) embedded into a <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> phase. Such <b>materials</b> are widely used {{for the production of}} permanent magnets, because they combine the high remanence with the large coercivity. We perform simulations of nanocomposites with Sr-ferrite as the hard phase and Fe or Ni as the soft phase, concentrating our efforts on analyzing the effects of (i) the imperfect intergrain exchange and (ii) the non-spherical shape of hard grains. We demonstrate that - in contrast to the common belief - the maximal energy product is achieved not for systems with the perfect intergrain exchange, but for materials where this exchange is substantially weakened. We also show that the main parameters of the hysteresis loop - remanence, coercivity and the energy product - exhibit non-trivial dependencies on the shape of hard grains, and provide detailed explanations for our results. Simulation predictions obtained in this work open new ways for the optimization of materials for permanent magnets...|$|R

40|$|Individual {{nanoscale}} {{building blocks}} exhibit {{a wide range}} of size-dependent properties, since their size can be tuned over known characteristic length scales of bulk materials. In the last several years, the possibility of combining different materials in the form of two and three component nanoparticles (NPs) has been extensively explored. Also multi-component materials can be obtained via self-assembly of NPs from their binary colloidal mixtures. These new nanocrystal solids may possess tunable collective properties that originate from interactions between size and composition controlled building blocks. Exchange coupling between neighboring NPs of <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> and hard <b>materials</b> enhances the magnetic energy product of the nanocomposite material. Randomly mixed solids of small and large semiconducting CdSe NPs revealed enhancement of photoluminescence intensity of large semiconductor particles accompanied by quenching of photoluminescence of the small particles because of long-range resonant transfer of electronic excitations from the more electronically confined small particles to higher excited states of the large particles. Recently, it was demonstrated that binary semiconducting composite materials can show strongly enhanced electronic properties with about 100 -fold higher conductance as compared to the sum of individual conductances of single-component films. Creation of highly periodic superlattices is expected not just provide the control of the homogeneity of the sample but also affect their properties. It was shown that silver nanocrystals organized into periodic cubic structures vibrated coherently [20] and demonstrated a change in electronic transport properties...|$|R
25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>material</b> of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a <b>magnetically</b> <b>soft</b> cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|R
