A background of existing {{research in the area of}} Wave Energy conversion and its potential around the world is given in the first chapters.  The main objective of my thesis has been support the design and construction of a unique wave energy conversion system constructed from multiple SQUID modules in a hexagonal array configuration. The project has been focused to look specifically at improving the hydraulic energy conversion efficiency, the feasibility of auto-setting operational variables according to the sea conditions, and the overall adaptability of the design to suit the specifications of the site and power requirements. Simulations using SimHydraulics have been developed to assess the design an optimal Hydraulic energy conversion system. With the output of the several simulations and hydraulic laboratory tests have been possible the sizing of its different components, and the design of special <b>manifold</b> <b>blocks</b> with self-setting hydraulic control, reducing the quantity and complexity the electronic devices for the general control. The key challenge facing the Wave Energy conversion Industry is lowering the cost of energy generation, where is required research and Development in order to design a device with high efficiency, high availability and low cost for the mass production. So achieving a viable wave energy future depends as much upon developing a technology that can be rapidly and economically scaled to high volume production.

As a consequence, interesting families of smooth 4 -manifolds, including the exotic K 3 surfaces of Gompf and Mrowka, admit symplectic structures. 1 Introduction A basic problem in symplectic topology is to understand what smooth manifolds admit a symplectic structure (a closed non-degenerate 2 -form). In this paper we focus on this question in dimension 4.
