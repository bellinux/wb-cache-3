5000|$|<b>Mischmetal</b> (from Mischmetall - [...] "mixed metal") is an alloy of {{rare earth}} elements. It is also called cerium <b>mischmetal,</b> rare earth <b>mischmetal</b> or misch metal. A typical {{composition}} includes approximately 50% cerium and 25% lanthanum, with {{small amounts of}} neodymium and praseodymium. Its most common use is in the ferrocerium [...] "flint" [...] ignition device of many lighters and torches, although an alloy of only rare-earth elements would be too soft to give good sparks. For this purpose, it is blended with iron oxide and magnesium oxide to form a harder material known as ferrocerium. In chemical formulae it is commonly abbreviated as Mm, e.g. MmNi5.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mischmetal</b> {{is used in}} the {{preparation}} of virtually all rare earth elements. This is because such elements are nearly identical in most chemical processes, meaning that ordinary extraction processes do not distinguish them. Highly specialized processes, such as those developed by Carl Auer von Welsbach, exploit subtle differences in solubility to separate <b>mischmetal</b> into its constituent elements, with each step producing only an incremental change in composition. Such processes later informed Marie Curie in her search for new elements.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, <b>mischmetal</b> was {{prepared}} from monazite, an anhydrous phosphate {{of the light}} lanthanides and thorium. The ore was cracked by reaction at high temperature either with concentrated sulfuric acid, or with sodium hydroxide. Thorium was removed {{by taking advantage of}} its weaker basicity relative to the trivalent lanthanides, its daughter radium was precipitated out using entrainment in barium sulfate, and the remaining lanthanides were converted to their chlorides. The resulting [...] "rare earth chloride" [...] (hexahydrate), sometimes known as [...] "lanthanide chloride", was the major commodity chemical of the rare earth industry. By careful heating, preferably with ammonium chloride or in an atmosphere of hydrogen chloride, the hexahydrate could be dehydrated to provide the anhydrous chloride. Electrolysis of the molten anhydrous chloride (admixed with other anhydrous halide to improve the melt behavior) {{led to the formation of}} molten <b>mischmetal,</b> which would then be cast into ingots. Any samarium content of the ore tended not to be reduced to the metal, but accumulated in the molten halide, from which it could later be profitably isolated. Monazite-derived <b>mischmetal</b> typically was about 48% cerium, 25% lanthanum, 17% neodymium, and 5% praseodymium, with the balance being the other lanthanides. When bastnäsite started being processed for rare earth content in about 1965, it too was converted to a version of rare earth chloride, and on to <b>mischmetal.</b> This version was higher in lanthanum and lower in neodymium.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the high}} demand for {{neodymium}} {{has made it}} profitable to remove all of the heavier lanthanides and neodymium (and sometimes all of the praseodymium as well) from the natural-abundance lanthanide mixture for separate sale, and to include only La-Ce-Pr or La-Ce in the most economical forms of <b>mischmetal.</b> The light lanthanides are so similar in their metallurgical properties, that any application for which the original composition would have been suitable, would be equally well served by these truncated mixtures. The traditional [...] "rare earth chloride", as a commodity chemical, was also used to extract the individual rare earths by companies that {{did not wish to}} process the ores directly.

50|$|Both AJ62A and AE44 are recent {{developments}} in high-temperature low-creep magnesium alloys.

50|$|Ductile iron is not {{a single}} {{material}} but {{part of a group of}} materials which can be produced with a wide range of properties through control of their microstructure. The common defining characteristic of this group of materials is the shape of the graphite. In ductile irons, graphite is in the form of nodules rather than flakes as in grey iron. Whereas sharp graphite flakes create stress concentration points within the metal matrix, rounded nodules inhibit the creation of cracks, thus providing the enhanced ductility that gives the alloy its name. Nodule formation is achieved by adding nodulizing elements, most commonly magnesium (magnesium boils at 1100 °C and iron melts at 1500 °C) and, less often now, cerium (usually in the form of <b>mischmetal).</b> Tellurium has also been used. Yttrium, often a component of <b>mischmetal,</b> has also been studied as a possible nodulizer.|$|E

50|$|Neodymium, a rare-earth metal, {{was present}} in the {{classical}} <b>mischmetal</b> at a concentration of about 18%.

50|$|Carl Auer von Welsbach was {{not only}} the {{discoverer}} of neodymium and praseodymium, and co-discoverer of lutetium, but was also the inventor of the light-mantle (using thorium), and of the rare earth industry. After extracting necessary thorium content from monazite sand, a lot of lanthanides were left over, for which there was no commercial use. He began exploration for applications to which the rare earths might be put. Among his first discoveries/inventions to bear practical fruit was <b>mischmetal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Interest {{grew in the}} 1970s {{with the}} {{commercialisation}} of the nickel-hydrogen battery for satellite applications. Hydride technology promised an alternative, less bulky way to store the hydrogen. Research carried out by Philips Laboratories and France's CNRS developed new high-energy hybrid alloys incorporating rare-earth metals for the negative electrode. However, these suffered from alloy instability in alkaline electrolyte and consequently insufficient cycle life. In 1987, Willems and Buschow demonstrated a successful battery based on this approach (using a mixture of La0.8Nd0.2Ni2.5Co2.4Si0.1), which kept 84% of its charge capacity after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. More economically viable alloys using <b>mischmetal</b> instead of lanthanum were soon developed. Modern NiMH cells were based on this design. The first consumer-grade NiMH cells became commercially available in 1989.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{the effect}} of <b>mischmetal</b> (48 wt%Ce– 27 wt%La– 14 wt%Nd– 6 wt%Pr) {{additions}} on the microstructural characteristics of an Cu- 7 wt%P brazing filler metal (BCuP- 2) were investigated. The volume fraction of primary Cu was considerably increased with increasing <b>mischmetal</b> addition in the BCuP- 2. Also, the eutectic structure was changed from lamella to fibrous morphology and the pseudo-eutectic phase (Cu 3 P) was formed around the primary Cu with the <b>mischmetal</b> addition above 0. 03 wt%. Compound containing {{a small amount of}} <b>mischmetal</b> was formed in the primary Cu phase and this compound acts as the nucleation sites of primary Cu. The fraction of primary Cu was increased by about 1 - 2 wt % due to the <b>mischmetal</b> rich phase. The <b>mischmetal</b> rich phase also formed in the pseudo-eutectic phase and this enhanced the formation of pseudo-eutectic phase. The addition of <b>mischmetal</b> changes the eutectic phase lamella to fibrous by suppressing both the solid-liquid interfacial energy and the surface energy of the solid. The <b>mischmetal</b> additions showed a very strong influence on the nucleation process of primary Cu and the subsequent formation of Cu 3 P phase as well as the eutectic structure change...|$|E
