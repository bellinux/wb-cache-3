25|$|Thus, in 1345, {{hearing of}} the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (probably {{including}} Queen Joan) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him; and as Joan cowered in their bed, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window. The horrible deed would taint the rest of Joan's reign.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 10 September 1946 in Amsterdam, when German expatriates {{and their families}} were arrested at {{their homes in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> given one hour to pack 50kg of luggage. They were only allowed to take 100 guilders with them. The remainder of their possessions were seized by the state. They were taken to internment camps near the German border, the largest of which was Mariënbosch, near Nijmegen. About 3,691 Germans (less than 15% {{of the total number of}} German expatriates in the Netherlands) were expelled. The Allied forces occupying the Western zone of Germany opposed this operation, fearing that other nations might follow suit.|$|E

Onset can be in childhood; however, in multiple studies the average age of onset was 45. Many studies showed that women are affected more commonly than men. This can be at least partly explained by men's reluctance to seek medical advice concerning such a delicate case as rectal pain.|$|E

25|$|The first {{transaction}} {{took place}} at the agreed-upon time of 04:00. Three prisoners were let aboard the aircraft and 30 passengers were let out. The final three prisoners were let aboard at 04:05. However, the remaining passengers were kept on board and instead the hijackers demanded that the aircraft be fueled before any more releases. This was accepted by Geijer at 04:08. The situation was not well received by the cabinet. Also, the six new prisoners were able to take over command of the situation on the aircraft, replacing the weary hijackers. Refueling {{took place at}} 04:48. They then demanded one million Swedish krona to release further hostages. Negotiations followed, whereby the police argued that acquiring such amounts of cash would be difficult in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> the hijackers reduced their demand to half a million. The police further argued that a rested flight crew would be at the advantage of the hijackers.|$|E

Speaking no English, Shi directed a cab driver with hand signals to an unknown destination, but the frustrated driver dropped him off {{in the middle of}} nowhere and called the police. Shi showed the police his passport and some newspaper clippings featuring him, so the police requested the driver take him to a Chinese restaurant in order to find someone who could communicate with him. However, since the staff at the restaurant spoke only Cantonese, and not Shi's Mandarin, the monk wrote down his communications, since both dialects employ the same characters. The restaurant staff helped Shi phone a friend in New York City, who had someone pick up Shi, who hid in a basement for a week, eating only bread and cereal, while the news media were reporting his escape. After a week, he traveled to New York.|$|E

500|$|September 11–12, 1839 – One of {{the worst}} storms in Bermuda's history strikes the islands from the south with an {{exceptional}} [...] storm surge. Boats along the southern shore are carried ashore and deposited in fields, while various species of fish are seen hundreds of yards inland.

Many families are left homeless, some forced to abandon {{their homes in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> endure the storm in the open.
