25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the <b>muscle</b> <b>fibre,</b> is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> in the submaxillaris muscle of the frog were studied using electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. The <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were capable of}} eliciting action potentials and their passive membrane properties {{were similar to those}} of fast <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres.</b> Composite end-plate potentials, due to polyneuronal innervation, were observed in most <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres.</b> Acetylcholinesterase staining of the whole muscle revealed multiple end-plate areas, and several end-plates of different size and shape were observed in single teased fibres.

40|$|Some {{effects of}} the sea anemone toxin, ATX-II, on {{vertebrate}} skeletal muscle have been described. At a concentration of 1 X 10 (- 7) - 1 X 10 (- 6) M, ATX-II caused a sodium-dependent depolarization of the <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> of the rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus, of the mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus and of the chicken posterior latissimus dorsi.

2500|$|A major {{effect of}} {{long-term}} weightlessness involves {{the loss of}} bone and muscle mass. Without the effects of gravity, skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture and the muscle groups used in moving around in a weightless environment differ from those required in terrestrial locomotion. In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back muscles or leg muscles used for standing up. [...] Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller. Consequently, some muscles atrophy rapidly, and without regular exercise astronauts can lose up to 20% of their muscle mass in just 5 to 11 days The types of <b>muscle</b> <b>fibre</b> prominent in muscles also change. Slow twitch endurance fibres used to maintain posture are replaced by fast twitch rapidly contracting fibres that are insufficient for any heavy labour. Advances in research on exercise, hormone supplements and medication may help maintain muscle and body mass.|$|E

40|$|Using {{confocal}} {{laser scanning}} and conventional light microscopy, the morphology {{and organization of}} the <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> in a proprioceptor, the thoracic coxal muscle receptor organ (TCMRO), and the associated ‘extrafusal’ promotor muscle were investigated in two species of decapod crustacea, the crayfish Cherax destructor and the mud crab Scylla serrata. The diameter of the TCMROs was shown to increase distally, with an increase up to 350 % recorded for the crayfish. The tapered shape of the crayfish TCMRO was demonstrated to amplify movements mechanically at the transducer region where the afferent nerves attach. Serial sectioning of the TCMROs, showed that the fibre number increased in the proximal to distal direction from 14 to 30 fibres in the crayfish and from 7 to 20 in the crab. Optical sectioning with the laser scanning confocal microscope revealed {{that the increase in}} fibre numbers was the result of <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> branching in the distal third section of the TCMRO. The percentage of muscle tissue in the cross-sectional area in the TCMRO was found to be only 35. 2 % and 64. 6 % in the crayfish and crab, respectively. Longitudinal sectioning using laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed the average sarcomere length of the TCMRO <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> of both species to be in the intermediate range for crustacean <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> (4. 1 ± 0. 1 µm and 4. 55 ± 0. 34 µm for the crayfish and crab) compared with the long sarcomere <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> in the associated promotor muscles (7. 87 ± 0. 2 and 10. 6 ± 0. 6 µm).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{respiratory}} muscles, force {{generation and}} shortening {{depend on the}} cyclical interaction of actin and myosin (cross-bridge cycling). During crossbridge cycling, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolysed. The globular head region of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) possesses both the binding site to actin and the site for ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, the MyHC is both a structural and enzymatic protein. Different isoforms of MyHC are expressed in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres,</b> and these MyHC isoforms provide mechanical and metabolic diversity. In the present study, the relationships between MyHC isoform expression in single rat diaphragm <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> and their mechanical and energetic properties were evaluated. The expression of MyHC isoforms in single diaphragm <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> was identified using electrophoretic and immunohistochemical techniques. Cross-bridge cycling kinetics in diaphragm <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> clearly depend on MyHC isoform expression, and these differences are interpreted {{in the context of}} Huxley's two-state crossbridge model. It is concluded that the unique mechanical and energetic properties of myosin heavy chain isoforms are designed to accomplish different motor behaviours of the diaphragm muscle, and that, {{as a result of these}} unique properties, a selective recruitment of diaphragm <b>muscle</b> <b>fibres</b> is essential to avoid fatigue...|$|R
