This poor wretch of a servant, often a mere child of {{fourteen}} or fifteen, lives by herself in a minute kitchen, and sleeps in a fireless attic. To escape vulgar associates, the children of the house avoid the elementary schools--the schools called in America public schools--where there are trained, efficient teachers, good apparatus, and an atmosphere of industry, and go to one of those wretched dens of disorderly imposture, a middle-class school, where an absolute failure to train or educate is seasoned with religious cant, lessons in piano- playing, lessons in French [...] "made in England," [...] mortarboard caps for the boys, and a high social tone. And to emphasize the fact of its social position, this bookless, bathless family tips! The plumber touches his hat for a tip, the man who moves the furniture, the butcher-boy at Christmas, the dustman; these things also, the respect and the tip, at their <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Everything is at its <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions,</b> it is the last chipped, dwarfed, enfeebled state of a tradition that has, in its time, played a fine part in the world. This much of honour still clings to it, it will endure no tip, no charity, no upper-class control of its privacy. This is the sort of home in which the minds of thousands of young Englishmen and Englishwomen receive their first indelible impressions. Can one expect them to escape the contagion of its cramped pretentiousness, its dingy narrowness, its shy privacy of social degradation, its essential sordidness and inefficiency? ...|$|E

Generally, {{the higher the}} skill level, the deeper the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions</b> must be, to prevent an excess of home runs. In the major leagues, a rule was passed in 1958 that compelled any new fields built after that point to have a minimum distance of 325 ft from home plate to the fences in left and right field, and 400 ft to center. (Rule 1.04, Note(a)). This rule was passed to avoid situations like the Los Angeles Coliseum, which was 251 ft. down the left field line.|$|E
50|$|The SABCA S.XII (or S.12) was a {{response}} to a July 1930 Belgian government call and funding for an all-Belgian multi-engine aircraft able to carry a useful load of between 350-500 kg. This was prompted by the purchase that summer by the national airline, SABENA, of four Westland Wessex trimotors. Speed, range and cabin <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions</b> were specified, a first flight before October 1930 was required and two examples were to be built. Alfred Renard was the only other manufacturer to respond. After comparing the designs of the S.XII and the Renard R.30, the official committee was unable to choose between them and ordered one example of each. Both were high wing, braced tri-motors, though with more power than SABENA's Wessex.|$|E
50|$|Unlike legal {{requirements}} {{in all other}} European countries, a standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black sans serif characters, no more than 70 mm high and 36 mm wide with a stroke width of 10 mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, {{both of which are}} allowed. Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions</b> of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm. Vehicle owners may be fined if the plate's format does not meet the requirements, and the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic National Car Test.|$|E

40|$|The boxicity of a graph G is the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimension</b> b {{such that}} G is representable as the {{intersection}} graph of axis-parallel {{boxes in the}} b-dimensional space. When the boxes are restricted to be axis-parallel b-dimensional cubes, the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimension</b> b required to represent G is called the cubicity of G. In this paper we show that cubicity(H-d) = (d - 1) /(log d). We also show that (1) cubicity(G) >= (log alpha) /(log(D + 1)), (2) cubicity(G) >= (log n - log omega) /(log D), where alpha, omega, D and n denote the stability number, the clique number, the diameter {{and the number of}} vertices of G. As consequences of these lower bounds we provide lower bounds for the cubicity of planar graphs, bipartite graphs, triangle-free graphs, etc., in terms of their diameter and the number of vertices.
