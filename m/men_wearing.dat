In keeping with French views, the French Football Federation said it would maintain its ban.|$|E

Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens in}} 35,000 B.C., in {{what will become}} North Texas. Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of <b>men</b> <b>wearing</b> hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{in a red}} dress moving across a screen of {{multiple}} changing colors and then moves to multiple shots of Elliott rapping in a white and red jersey and matching hat, Lyte in a blue dress, and a church choir group. Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of <b>men</b> <b>wearing</b> orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Greece, kouros sculptures {{from the}} archaic period depict <b>men</b> <b>wearing</b> dreadlocks while Spartan hoplites wore formal locks {{as part of}} their battle dress. Spartan magistrates known as Ephors also wore their hair braided in long locks, an Archaic Greek {{tradition}} that was steadily abandoned in other Greek kingdoms. The style was worn by Ancient Christian Ascetics in the Middle East and Mediterranean, and the Dervishes of Islam, among others. Some of the very earliest adherents of Christianity in the Middle East may have worn this hairstyle; there are descriptions of James the Just, first Bishop of Jerusalem, who is said to have worn them to his ankles.|$|E
25|$|Since women {{almost never}} {{participate}} in traditional dances, scenes that involve female characters are played by young <b>men</b> <b>wearing</b> masks. Masks for female characters usually portray a modest and virtuous woman who abides by society’s norms. La Malinche, interpreter for Cortés, {{is most often}} shown this way, but sometimes can be depicted as a sexy woman, with a mask that shows gaudy makeup. Other non-conformist women include antisocial characters such as “Las Viudas” (The Widows) of Carnival in Nezquipayac and La Borracha (The Drunk Woman) from the Danza del Torito in Guanajuato. Masks for these characters are unflattering. Another example is the La Marignuilla (Little Mary) of the Purépecha, who imitates city women, whose life is considered immoral by the indigenous. This mask depicts thick make up and wears a tight dress.|$|E
25|$|On 25 October, a {{group of}} anti-Occupy {{supporters}} wearing blue ribbons gathered at Tsim Sha Tsui to show their support of the police.

A female reporter for RTHK, a male reporter and two photographers for TVB were taken to hospital. A group of about 10 <b>men</b> <b>wearing</b> face masks attacked suffragists in Mong Kok. Six people were arrested for common assault. Alex Chow said that citizens deserved a chance to express their views over the constitutional reform proposal and the NPCSC's decision of 31 August. He said that the protest would only end if the government offered a detailed timeline or roadmap to allow universal suffrage and withdrawal of the standing committee decision.|$|E
