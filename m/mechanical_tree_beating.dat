40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{and discusses}} results of four studies regarding {{the effects of}} growing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in containers on root deformation, tree stability, basal sweep- and compression wood formation. The thesis is based on non-experimental surveys that include young (7 - to 9 -year-old) and older (19 - to 24 -year-old) Scots pine trees from naturally regenerated stands and from stands established with container-grown (Paperpot) seedlings. The thesis is also based on data obtained from 6 - and 22 -year-old trials with Scots pine seedlings reared from containers of different design. Results showed that root morphology, <b>mechanical</b> <b>tree</b> stability and stem straightness of container-grown Scots pine trees will improve over time and approach the state of naturally regenerated trees. However, inside the root system fibre disturbances as well as bark remains still occur. Root deformation caused by improper design of containers may lead to <b>mechanical</b> <b>tree</b> instability and leaning trees, which will cause compression wood formation. For 6 -year-old Scots pine trees, the correlation between basal sweep and compression wood content was strong. No correlation between these variables was obtained for older trees that had become straighter over time. Therefore, the straightness of a stem is not per se a reliable measure of occurrence of compression wood within the stem. Because the formation of compression wood in the basal part is ongoing as long as trees are not completely straight, {{it is difficult to}} forecast the future quality of such logs. This thesis shows that container design affects root development, which can subsequently influence the formation of basal sweep. The stem form of Scots pine can be improved by the use of a container type that promotes a more natural root morphology, especially in fertile sites with dense soil types...|$|R

Twenty-eight bauxite mines and three forest references were surveyed by transects of pitfall traps, vegetation sweeping, <b>tree</b> <b>beating,</b> and both day and night hand collecting. Physical and botanical measurements were also taken. Using both species richness and Shannon’s species diversity as descriptors, it was demonstrated by multiple regression analysis that ant return was positively associated with plant species richness and diversity, time since rehabilitation, percentage plant cover in certain strata, percentage litter cover, and the presence of coarse woody debris. Principal components analysis confirmed that these site variables also influenced the composition of the ant assemblages in the rehabilitated areas. Despite the oldest plots being 13 years old, no rehabilitated plots attained an ant assemblage that even closely resembled that of the forest references.|$|R

30|$|Prescribed fire is {{a logical}} {{management}} option for restoring forest structure and fuel loading to more resilient conditions (Ryan et al. 2013), especially when <b>mechanical</b> <b>tree</b> removal operations are not as feasible (e.g., national parks or wilderness areas).

Conversely, fire of higher intensity may be effective in restoring natural fire behavior in ponderosa pine forests (Fulé et al. 2012). While mechanical treatments prior to prescribed burning are more effective (Harrington and Sackett 1990, Arno et al. 1995, Covington et al. 1997), mechanical treatments may not be allowed in protected areas, leaving prescribed fire as the tool of choice. This poses a management challenge as prescribed burning alone may not completely meet management objectives (Arno et al. 1995, Ryan et al. 2013).|$|R

This time, litter extraction was also performed using Tullgren funnels. The latter method was added {{to see if any}} litter-associated species had been missed by the other procedures and to offset the lack of night-time collecting (which is now administratively difficult to carry out). Sampling was carried out in April 2012 when conditions were still hot and dry and the litter sampling was repeated in winter (June) when the litter was moist. Ants were identified {{in the same way as}} in the long-term study, and the data were summarised as abundance, species richness, and functional group profile. In addition, for each plot the species were summarised as new to the area, lost from the original survey, or present in both surveys. Changes in the assemblage composition were assessed by principal components analysis, using ant presence/absence data derived from all sampling methods. We used the centred form of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (Chatfield and Collins 1980) to ordinate the samples. The software package CANOCO 4.5 (ter Braak and Šmilauer 2002) was used to perform the calculations. The results were visualised using the CanoDraw option of the CANOCO package.

40|$|The Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) is an {{indicator}} of ecosystem integrity of Florida scrub, an endangered ecosystem that requires frequent fire. One of the largest populations of this federally threatened species occurs on John F. Kennedy Space Center/Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. Population trends were predicted using population modeling and field data on reproduction and survival of Florida Scrub-Jays collected from 1988 - 1995. Analyses of historical photography indicated that habitat suitability has been declining for 30 years. Field data and computer simulations suggested that the population declined by at least 40 % and will decline by another 40 % in 1 0 years, if habitat management is not greatly intensified. Data and computer simulations suggest that habitat suitability cannot deviate greatly from optimal for the jay population to persist.

40|$|International audienceThe GreenLab {{model was}} used to study the {{interaction}} between source-sink dynamics at the whole tree level, wood production and distribution within the stem, and <b>tree</b> <b>mechanical</b> stability through simulation and optimization. In this first promising numerical attempt, two GreenLab parameters were considered {{in order to maximize}} wood production: the sink strength for cambial growth and a coefficient that determines the way the biomass assigned to cambial growth is allocated to each metamer, through optimization and simulation respectively. The optimization procedure that has been used is based on a heuristic optimization algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In {{the first part of the}} paper, wood production was maximized without considering the effect of wood distribution on <b>tree</b> <b>mechanical</b> stability. Contrary to common idea that increasing sink strength for cambial growth leads to increasing wood production, an optimal value can be found. The optimization results implied that an optimal source and sink balance should be considered to optimize wood production. In a further step, the <b>mechanical</b> stability of <b>trees</b> submitted to their self weight was taken into account based on simplified mechanical assumptions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diversity}} {{and complexity of}} invertebrate communities usually result in their exclusion from conservation activities. Here we provide a step process for assessing predominantly ground-dwelling Afrotemperate forest invertebrates' (earthworms, centipedes, millipedes, ants, molluscs) potential as surrogates for conservation and indicators for monitoring. We also evaluated sampling methods (soil and litter samples, pitfall traps, active searching quadrats and <b>tree</b> <b>beating)</b> and temporal (seasonal) effects. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Lack of congruence of species richness across taxa indicated poor surrogacy potential {{for any of the}} focus taxa. Based on abundance and richness, seasonal stability, and ease of sampling, molluscs were the most appropriate taxon for use in monitoring of disturbance impacts. Mollusc richness was highest in March (Antipodal late summer wet season). The most effective and efficient methods were active searching quadrats and searching litter samples. We tested the effectiveness of molluscs as indicators for monitoring by contrasting species richness and community structure in burned relative to unburned forests. Both species richness and community structure changed significantly with burning. Some mollusc species (e. g. Macroptychia africana) showed marked negative responses to burning, and these species have potential for use as indicators. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite habitat type (i. e., Afrotemperate forest) being constant, species richness and community structure varied across forest patches. Therefore, in conservation planning, setting targets for coarse filter features (e. g., habitat type) requires fine filter features (e. g., localities for individual species). This is especially true for limited mobility taxa such as those studied here. Molluscs have high potential for indicators for monitoring, and this requires broader study...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Old {{growth in}} the frequent-fire conifer forests of the western United States, such as those {{containing}} ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), giant sequoia (Sequioa giganteum) and other species, has undergone major changes since Euro-American settlement. Understanding past changes and anticipating future changes under different potential management scenarios are fundamental to developing ecologically based fuel reduction or ecological restoration treatments. Some of the many {{changes that have occurred}} in these forests include shifts from historically frequent surface fire to no fire or to stand-replacing fire regimes, increases in tree density, increased abundance of fire-intolerant trees, decreases in understory productivity, hydrological alterations, and accelerated mortality of old trees. Although these changes are widespread, the magnitude and causes of changes may vary within and among landscapes. Agents of change, such as fire exclusion or livestock grazing, likely interacted and had multiple effects. For example, historical ranching operations may have altered both fire regimes and understory vegetation, and facilitated institutional fire exclusion through fragmentation and settlement. Evidence exists for large variation in presettlement characteristics and current condition of old growth across this broad forest region, although there are many examples of striking similarities on widely distant landscapes. Exotic species, climate change, unnatural stand-replacing wildfires, and other factors will likely continue to degrade or eradicate old growth in many areas.
