40|$|After the mid- 1980 s, {{it became}} {{necessary}} to harmonise asylum {{policy of the}} European Union (EU) due to {{the increasing number of}} asylum applications and the removal of internal borders between the Member States. To this end, Member States firstly approximated their asylum policies through intergovernmental initiatives and then gradually communitarised asylum policy of the EU via treaty reforms. The Amsterdam Treaty put asylum policy, for the first time, under the Community competence and subsequent treaties further increased EU’s competence. Meanwhile, the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) has been established under three <b>multi-annual</b> <b>programmes,</b> namely the Tampere, the Hague and the Stockholm Programmes. This thesis explores to what extent the Member States have transferred their competence in asylum policy to the EU in particular since 1999 when the Amsterdam Treaty came into force and the CEAS was introduced. It accordingly analyses both primary and secondary EU law on asylum with a critical legal approach. The development of the common European asylum policy and its gradual shift from the national to the intergovernmental and eventually to the supranational level resulting from the transfer of competence are also analysed from a neo-functionalist perspective...|$|E

However, there has been limited assessment of the success of capacity reduction schemes (CRS). In this paper, the success of a CRS is assessed for a European fishery characterised by differences in efficiency levels of individual boats. In such a fishery, given it is assumed that the least efficient producers are the first to exit through a CRS, the reduction in harvesting capacity is less than the nominal reduction in physical fleet capacity. Further, there is potential for harvesting capacity to increase if remaining vessels improve their efficiency.

Given their outstanding strategic importance, the European Commission has launched several policies to promote the development of SMEs, their access to finance and investment in R&D and innovation. A prominent role among EU programmes targeting SMEs is played by the <b>Multi-Annual</b> <b>Programme</b> for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship 2001 - 2005 (MAP), funded by Community budget and co-financing instruments.

The underlying reasons for the modest impact on improved resource sustainability are considered, despite capacity reductions in nominal terms. These include the impact of subsidies on capacity development and issues surrounding the use of vessel decommissioning. The Danish fishing fleet case serves as an empirical example in this regard.
