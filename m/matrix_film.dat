500|$|For {{most of the}} series, Clark did {{not wear}} any sort of costume when in his superhero persona. From seasons one through eight, Clark was {{typically}} dressed in either red, yellow and blue (the traditional colors of the Superman costume), or in the All-American colors of red, white, and blue. This included the primary usage of either a blue T-shirt underneath a red jacket, or a red T-shirt worn under a blue jacket. In season nine, the producers decided to design an actual costume for Clark to wear while patrolling the streets of Metropolis. Abandoning the theme of red, blue, and yellow, the producers chose to keep the costume completely black, save for a silver Superman [...] "S" [...] shield painted on the front. Instead of the traditional cape, Clark's red jacket is traded for a black trenchcoat. This drew comparison {{to the character of}} Neo from The <b>Matrix</b> <b>film</b> series. It was also compared to the black suit Superman wore after being resurrected, following his death at the hands of Doomsday in the comic books.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The <b>Matrix</b> <b>film</b> series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is to develop {{polymeric}} <b>matrix</b> <b>films</b> loaded with a combination of free diclofenac sodium (DFSfree) and DFS:Ion exchange resin complexes (DFS:IR) for immediate and sustained release profiles, respectively. Effect of ratio of DFS and IR on the DFS:IR complexation efficiency was studied using batch processing. DFS:IR complex, DFSfree, or a combination of DFSfree+DFS:IR loaded <b>matrix</b> <b>films</b> were prepared by melt-cast technology. DFS content was 20 % w/w in these <b>matrix</b> <b>films.</b> In vitro transcorneal permeability from the film formulations were compared against DFS solution, using a side-by-side diffusion apparatus, over a 6 h period. Ocular disposition of DFS from the solution, films and corresponding suspensions were evaluated in conscious New Zealand albino rabbits, 4 h and 8 h post-topical administration. All in vivo studies were carried out as per the University of Mississippi IACUC approved protocol. Complexation efficiency of DFS:IR was found to be 99 % with a 1 : 1 ratio of DFS:IR. DFS release from DFS:IR suspension and the film were best-fit to a Higuchi model. In vitro transcorneal flux with the DFSfree+DFS:IR(1 : 1) (1 + 1) was twice that of only DFS:IR(1 : 1) film. In vivo, DFS solution and DFS:IR(1 : 1) suspension formulations were not able to maintain therapeutic DFS levels in the aqueous humor (AH). Both DFSfree and DFSfree+DFS:IR(1 : 1) (3 + 1) loaded <b>matrix</b> <b>films</b> were able to achieve and maintain high DFS concentrations in the AH, but elimination of DFS from the ocular tissues was much faster with the DFSfree formulation. DFSfree+DFS:IR combination loaded <b>matrix</b> <b>films</b> were able to deliver and maintain therapeutic DFS concentrations in the anterior ocular chamber for up to 8 h. Thus, free drug/IR complex loaded <b>matrix</b> <b>films</b> could be a potential topical ocular delivery platform for achieving immediate and sustained release characteristics...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{earned a}} 1.1 {{household}} Nielsen rating, which was down by one-tenth {{of a point}} or 8% from [...] "Adrift". It fell behind ECW on Sci Fi (with a 1.2 rating), Eureka (with a 1.4 rating) and Ghost Hunters (with a 1.5 rating). In the United Kingdom, [...] "Lifeline" [...] received 443,000 viewers, placing Stargate Atlantis as number six in the top ten broadcasts for Sky One for that week, behind The Simpsons and Prison Break. It was positively received by most critics. Tory Ireland Mell of IGN rated the episode a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 {{out of a possible}} 10, praising the slow introduction of Carter, rather than having an SG-1 team member forced into the series, and stated the episode gets the viewer [...] "glued to the television for one hour." [...] Critical Myth rated the episode 8 out of 10, stating the episode as [...] "light on plot twists but packs an emotional punch," [...] and was somewhat critical for the lack of surprises in the episode's storyline. Brett Love of TV Squad liked the episode's storyline, and thought Weir's exit was executed well, despite leaks from the Internet that Weir would be leaving, and compared the scene between her and Oberoth to the confrontations between Neo and Agent Smith from The <b>Matrix</b> <b>film</b> series. However, Love was critical about the absence of Teyla throughout the majority of the episode.|$|E
