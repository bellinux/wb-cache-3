40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} both historiography and intercultural philosophy, trying {{to offer a}} {{detailed}} account of the long European interpretation of other civilizations, namely India and China, from the Renaissance neo-platonic thinkers to the late Enlightenment. Neo-platonism provided the most influential historiogaphic model for at least two centuries - “perennial philosophy. ” According to this model, all philosophies and philosophers – of the world and of all times – were part of an ancient lineage of wisdom, that went back to God or at least the patriarchs. India and China were inserted within this historiographic model not without several hermeneutic and chronological problems. The life of this model covered all centuries I investigated, undergoing continuous new interpretations and drastic changes also caused by these two civilizations. The real crisis of this model may be found in Heumann and Brücker, representatives of the anti-Wolfian German Philosophy. However, I claim that, even if harshly criticized, the perennial philosophy <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> in new ways through the 19 th century...|$|E

40|$|The {{luminous}} electromagnetic emission {{from distant}} active galactic nuclei (AGNs) including quasars {{is believed to}} be powered by accretion onto super-massive black holes (SMBHs). In the standard unification model for AGNs a dusty torus covers {{a significant portion of the}} viewing angles to the accretion disk and the BH. The system is classified as a type-I AGN if the accretion disk is viewed through the opening part; otherwise it is called a type-II AGN. Therefore the ratio of type-II to type-I AGNs serves as a sensitive probe to the unification model. A surprising discovery made from several large sky coverage and/or deep AGN surveys has found a significant anti-correlation between the type-II fraction and the observed X-ray luminosity between 2 - 10 keV. This suggests two different luminosity functions for the two types of AGNs, thus challenging the AGN unification model. However this observed anti-correlation is a natural consequence of the AGN unification model with only one intrinsic luminosity function if the inclination angle effects of the X-ray emitting accretion disk are taken into account. Thus the AGN unification <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> another critical test. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, submitted on 2004 Oct. 20 and accepted on 2004 Dec. 1 for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|E
40|$|EMRI was {{the first}} not-for-profit public private {{partnership}} (PPP) arrangement in the healthcare sector in India. From its modest beginnings of providing emergency response services with 15 ambulances in single city of India, EMRI grew its operations across 8 states - with 1, 550 ambulances serving 366 million people - all free of cost. The business <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> some of India’s most daunting challenges, such as its cultural and language diversities and difficulties of partnering with the government. Within a short span of {{three and a half}} years, EMRI became a star success, lauded by the public and politicians alike. The company faced a major crisis when its Chairman resigned and was arrested for fraud. The CEO took over the reins of the organisation and adeptly managed the crisis – he kept the operations going; managed employee morale; continued to receive government support; handled bad press; salvaged EMRI’s reputation and obtained a new private sponsor. Shortly after, EMRI was taken over by GVK Power and Infrastructure Limited. With a new sponsor and changing business environment, the CEO had to determine his organisation’s growth strategy – should he continue to expand EMRI 2 ̆ 7 s operations across India? Or should he deepen EMRI’s footprint by offering other services in states where it already has presence? Is the current business model scalable and will the quality of service be compromised with rapid expansion? From where will he get the funds to support such growth? How can he modify the PPP model and yet preserve the ethos and values EMRI was built upon...|$|E
30|$|The {{excessive}} response {{may be a}} {{preparation for}} unpredictable and harder conditions forthcoming. If {{the extent of the}} response is only appropriate but not excessive, the organism will be killed immediately by worse environmental factors before it has time to motivate stronger protective mechanisms. Such kind of response may also exist in other cellular processes besides ROS metabolism. It is well known that physical activity is beneficial for health in terms of prevention of heart disease and cancer, fat control, and maintenance of mental function (Berra et al., 1977; Douchi et al., 2000; Hotting and Roder, 2013). However, toxic lactate and ROS are generated during exercise. The paradox can be reconciled by the excessive response which implicates that lactate or ROS will activate stronger protective mechanisms and may protect against potential diseases inducing factors in the long term. Ionizing radiation and ROS inducing strategies are widely used for cancer treatments (Gupta et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2000; Schumacker, 2006). According to the excessive response <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> tumor cells may obtain higher capability to deal with additional ROS-generating insults and higher dose of irradiation, which makes them harder to be killed by the immune system. Thus, “super” tumor cell is born out of adverse environment, which to some extent explains why people with cancer usually die sooner after radiotherapy. Consistently, adaptation to hydrogen peroxide enhances PC 12 cell tolerance against oxidative damage (Chen et al., 2005), and worms grown on plates containing higher level of the prooxidant paraquat show stronger resistance to multiple kinds of stresses (Ren et al., 2017). Similar kinds of excessive responses may also exist in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and other cellular processes, which deserve further investigations.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{most widely}} used mice model of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is an MHC-matched bone marrow {{transplantation}} model of sclerodermatous cGvHD. A limitation of that model is that mortality is relatively low, making difficult to study the impact of potentially therapeutic compounds. Aims: To develop a more severe model of cGVHD and {{to assess the impact}} of Rapamycin administration in that model. Results: Lethally irradiated Balb/C mice were injected with 10 x 106 bone marrow cells and 70 x 106 splenocytes from B 10. D 2 donor mice. Twenty-one days later, all mice developed cGvHD. For the severe model, donor B 10. D 2 mice were injected with 0. 5 x 106 splenocytes from Balb/C twenty-one days before transplantation. All mice from the severe model (n= 8) died a median of 32 days while 3 of 7 mice in the classical <b>model</b> <b>survived</b> beyond day 52. Mean survival was decreased in the severe model compared to the classical model (32 days versus 37 days; p= 0. 0185). Recipient mice in the severe group experienced higher weight loss, hair loss and skin fi brosis. Numbers of T lymphocytes (231. 9 ± 151. 4 versus 951 ± 532. 8; p= 0. 0032) and CD 4 + T cells (63. 25 ± 41. 93 versus 135. 0 ± 14. 39; p= 0. 0018) per microliter of blood at day 21 were lower in the severe group than in the classical model. Moreover, number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was decreased in the severe model (1. 250 ± 0. 8864 versus 8. 000 ± 6. 753; p= 0. 0151). We then investigated whether rapamycin administration could prevent GVHD in the severe model. All (n= 8) mice treated with PBS (placebo) died a median of 32 days after transplantation, while 6 of 8 mice given 1 mg/kg/day i. p. rapamycin survived beyond day 52 (p= 0. 0012). Number of Tregs/μl was higher at day 21 in rapamycin-treated mice than in mice given PBS (2. 000 ± 1. 195 versus 1. 250 ± 0. 8864; p= 0. 0796). Moreover, number of naïve CD 4 +T (10. 00 ± 4. 192 versus 30. 25 ± 5. 185; p= 0. 0089) and effector memory T cells (EMT) (30. 67 ± 3. 180 versus 67. 33 ± 7. 881; p= 0. 0125) were higher in rapamycin mice. Finally, proliferation of EMT (assessed by fl ow cytometry using Ki- 67) was higher in PBS than in rapamycin mice (45. 28 %± 4. 084 versus 31. 90 %± 2. 003; p= 0. 0474). Conclusion: We have developed a mice model of severe cGVHD. Interestingly, rapamycin prevented death from cGVHD in that model, perhaps through in vivo expansion of Treg. Peer reviewe...|$|E
