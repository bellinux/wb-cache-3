5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced {{to come to terms with}} the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|UA 8699 was {{discovered}} in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) {{and placed in the}} collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage. In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for marsupial affinities of the specimen. Because the specimen is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that the specimen was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon. In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider the specimen as a marsupial and announced that an upcoming paper by Case would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> marsupial affinities more fully.|$|E

25|$|On 12 December, with Pakistan facing {{imminent}} defeat, the United States {{requested that}} the Security Council be reconvened.

The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan's forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic.

25|$|In October 2003, Muhammad went {{on trial}} {{for the murder of}} Dean Meyers at a Prince William County service station near the city of Manassas. The trial had been moved from Prince William County, to Virginia Beach, {{approximately}} 200 miles away. Muhammad was granted the right to represent himself in his defense, and dismissed his legal counsel, though he immediately switched back to having legal representation after his opening argument. He was charged with murder, terrorism, conspiracy and the illegal use of a firearm, and faced a possible death sentence. Prosecutors said the shootings were part of a plot to extort $10 million from local and state governments. The prosecution said that they would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> 16 shootings allegedly involving Muhammad. The terrorism charge against Muhammad required prosecutors to prove he committed at least two shootings in a three-year period.|$|E
500|$|With the Webster-Ashburton Treaty {{ratified}} in 1843, Tyler {{was ready}} to make the annexation of Texas his [...] "top priority". Representative Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia was authorized by the administration to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> annexation to the American electorate. In a widely circulated open letter, understood as an announcement of the executive branch's designs for Texas, Gilmer described Texas as a panacea for North-South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests. The slavery issue, however divisive, would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution. Domestic tranquility and national security, Tyler argued, would result from an annexed Texas; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union. Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti-annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and on June 23, 1843 [...] appointed Abel P. Upshur, a Virginia states' rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation. This cabinet shift signaled Tyler's intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Brannan {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} The Objective Standard, and noted that it provides a [...] "barrage of evidence in moral defense of the oil sands producers", while Peter Foster, a Financial Post columnist, suggested that Levant [...] "not only exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the media-coddled opponents of the vast resource, but raises the uncomfortable question of what alternatives to the oilsands these moralists prefer". On the other hand, David Suzuki, dismissing Levant as an [...] "apologist", argued that [...] "the logic is faulty. Just because a country or society is considered 'ethical' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical". In the Winnipeg Free Press, John Collins, a retired union negotiator, criticized some of Levant's sources, noting {{the presence of the}} Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes, while Patrick Brethour, an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada, contends that the title of Levant’s book [...] "is a considerable misstatement" [...] and that Levant [...] "fails to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> ethical oil".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Morley derided the {{seriousness}} of contemporary music writers: [...] "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists - or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks - actually write {{with a kind of}} fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been." [...] That same year, Rosen forewarned possible excesses of the new movement; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, PopMatters Rob Horning responded to Rosen's embracing of poptimism and wrote that it is [...] "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction." [...] Writing for The Quietus in 2017, Michael Hann argued that [...] "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and lists the following as a few poptimist [...] "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge": ...|$|E
500|$|Markham had, {{through his}} various activities, {{come to know}} many {{influential}} people, and during the early 1870s used these connections to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a Royal Naval Arctic expedition. Prime minister Benjamin Disraeli consented, in the [...] "spirit of maritime enterprise that has ever distinguished the English people". When the expedition was ready to sail, Markham was invited to accompany {{it as far as}} Greenland, on , one of the expedition's three ships. Markham accepted, and left with the convoy on [...] 1875. He was gone for three months, remaining with Alert as far as the island of Disco in Baffin Bay. He wrote of this journey: [...] "I never had a happier cruise... a nobler set of fellows never sailed together." [...] He returned to England on the support vessel , although the homeward voyage was delayed after Valorous struck a reef and required substantial repairs. Markham's extended absence from his India Office duties, together with his increasing involvement in a range of other interests, caused his superiors to request his resignation. Markham retired from his post in 1877, his 22 years of service entitling him to a pension.|$|E
500|$|In Imagined History, Fading Memory: Mastering Narrative in Final Fantasy X, Washburn {{writes that}} Final Fantasy X [...] "makes the {{relationship}} of memory, history, and the struggle for control of knowledge a central element of both its gameplay and its narrative." [...] Washburn gives a synopsis of the game's alternate history and describes Spira's development as [...] "evok a number of culturally vital discourses in Japan that the designers of the game drew on: the modernist aesthetics of evanescence, the loss of faith and belief {{in a society where}} technology and religion clash, the desire for a dream realm of memories as the source of an alternative history, and the nostalgic desire for the sublime experience of the annihilation of the past and the completion of history." [...] Washburn uses Final Fantasy X and the analysis of its narrative to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> academic study of the medium and counter the critical views held by detractors like Espen Aarseth, summarizing that [...] "The ability to complete the game requires mastering not only the instrumental controls needed to acquire and perfect game skills but also the narrative itself, the cultural knowledge of Spira that facilitates the acquisition of skills and abilities." [...] In Languages Of Navigation Within Computer Games Flynn asserts that Final Fantasy Xs navigation is a representative and symbolic language, writing that [...] "lthough Final Fantasy X establishes itself through the opening cut scene as narrative based, it becomes clear that a poetic and mythic experience of space rather than a cinematic sense of space is in operation." ...|$|E
