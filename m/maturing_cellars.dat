40|$|Cheesemaking {{is in the}} Tropical Agronomy series, {{published}} by ACCT, and describes cheese production techniques, on both a small and an industrial scale. These are very little known in tropical regions, and where they do exist, are very small-scale. Climatic conditions do not favour rearing milk herds, nor the collection and concervation of milk. Today techniques have advanced sufficiently to allow cheese to be made from reconstituted milk, {{and it is not}} particularly difficult to transfer the technical data currently used in Europe, and adapt them for use in countries with different climates. Airconditioning in factories and <b>maturing</b> <b>cellars</b> means that, whatever the outside temperature, work can be carried out in the correct temperature. Reconstituted milk can be used in conjunction with locally-produced milk. This book addresses the problems of collection, processing, fermentation, mechanization, and maturing, and will be of help in setting up industrial workshops which can market cheeses which keep longer than fresh or pasteurised milk, and which are more acceptable to local populations than drinking-milk.

50|$|Cheese making {{can be done}} in all of the defined area. Cow’s milk, specifically, is {{whole and}} full of rennet. The {{operation}} takes place with hot milk (30 to 33 °C) {{at the same time as}} the seeding of spores from the Penicillium roqueforti mushroom, the mold responsible for the blue forms. These spores are from selected strains in the refining area. Under the action of the rennet, the milk coagulates.The curd is then sliced and then brewed. The grains are then become rounded and let out the whey. Draining can then be done on perforated molds. It is promoted by inverting the cheese. At demolding, the cheese is salted with dry salt (not soaking in brine). Work at the dairy then completes and the cheeses are shipped to the <b>maturing</b> <b>cellar.</b> Upon arriving at the <b>maturing</b> <b>cellar,</b> the cheeses are then brushed or washed and wiped. They are then perforated: this operation promotes internal ventilation of the cheese and allows harmonious development of mold. The cheese is then stored on racks in cellars naturally temperature controlled by fleurine. Between production and refinement, preparation should take at least 70 days. Before selling, refrigeration is not part of the refinement.|$|R
50|$|Beer in England {{has been}} brewed for {{hundreds}} of years. As a beer brewing country, England {{is known for its}} top fermented cask beer (also called real ale) which finishes <b>maturing</b> in the <b>cellar</b> of the pub rather than at the brewery and is served with only natural carbonation.|$|R
5000|$|Munster (...) , Munster-géromé, or (Alsatian) Menschterkaas, is {{a strong}} tasting, soft cheese made mainly from milk from the Vosges, between Alsace, Lorraine and Franche-Comté in France. Munster {{is derived from the}} Alsace town of Munster, where, among Vosgian abbeys and monasteries, the cheese was conserved and <b>matured</b> in monks' <b>cellars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fresh {{from the}} farm, milk is poured into large copper vats {{where it is}} gently warmed. Each cheese {{requires}} up to 600 L of milk. Rennet is added, causing the milk to coagulate. The curds are then cut into tiny white grains that are the size of rice or wheat which are then stirred before being heated again for around 30 minutes. The contents are then placed into moulds and the whey is pressed out. After several hours the mould is opened and left to <b>mature</b> in <b>cellars,</b> first {{for a few weeks}} at the dairy, and then over several months elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The cheese's crust must {{be washed}} regularly. It is <b>matured</b> in damp <b>cellars</b> {{for five weeks}} for the smaller formats (roughly 300 g) and up to 2 to 3 months for the larger ones (about 1500 g). During this period, the rind is {{periodically}} washed with brine. The added moisture helps the development of bacteria that gives this cheese its particular taste and color.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of Caecuban {{seemed to have}} hit its apex in Horace’s time. Following the ascension of Augustus to power, Setinum was declared the Imperial wine-namely (according to Pliny) {{because it did not}} cause him indigestion and it rose in popularity accordingly (Natural History XIV.61). Pliny noted that the vineyard was starting to fall into neglect when Nero tore up the area, under the pretence of a planned ship canal across the land, in order to undertake excavations to find the legendary treasure of Dido which {{was supposed to have been}} buried there. The destruction of Caecuban’s single vineyard extinguished the wine completely; but in Martial’s time, if his words can be relied on, Caecuban wine was still <b>maturing</b> in <b>cellars</b> at Amyclae. Galen is the last person on record to have tasted Caecuban wine, nearly a century after it ceased to be made.|$|R
50|$|Chabichou of Poitou is made {{of fresh}} and whole goat's milk. It is quickly but {{slightly}} pressurized: less than 100 microliters per liter of milk. They then let the milk coagulate during a 24-hour period between 20 and 22°C. This curd is then moulded manually with a ladle or mixer into perforated and truncated moulds and left to drain for another 18 to 24 hours while turning it over it two or three times, maintaining it at 22°C. Afterwards, they are removed from the moulds and salted with dry salt or sometimes in a brine bath. It is then laid out in drying rooms, i.e. it is drained while being placed in moulds for 24 to 48 hours. Afterwards it is left to <b>mature</b> in <b>cellars</b> at between 10 and 12°C and within 80% to 90% humidity. It remains there for at least 10 days, but generally {{for two or three}} weeks. Some are even preserved for months for a more vigorous flavor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHundreds of {{different}} cheeses are produced in France, where 23. 9 kg of cheese were consumed per inhabitant in 2009, {{when it was}} ranked the second cheese-consuming nation. To meet this considerable demand, {{a large number of}} cheese factories exist where many workers, especially cheese-washers, may be exposed to fungal bioaerosols which can lead to adverse toxinic and allergic effects. Airborne bacteria, fragments or microbial by-products (endotoxins) are also found and contribute to total worker exposure. However, there is almost no published data concerning worker exposure or characteristics of bioaerosols emitted during these activities. Here, we measured the parameters (concentrations, species present, and size distribution) of the culturable fungal bioaerosol emitted in a French natural-rind cheeses <b>maturing</b> <b>cellar.</b> Concentrations of airborne bacteria and endotoxins were also measured. The main tasks were investigated using stationary or personal sampling over three consecutive days. Depending on the work area, high concentrations of culturable mesophilic microorganisms were measured (using closed-face cassettes) : from 104 to 2 × 108 CFU. m- 3 for fungi, and from 103 to 106 CFU. m- 3 for bacteria. These concentrations are 10 - to 100, 000 -fold higher than those measured at two reference points (indoor and outdoor) which are assumed not to be contaminated by the plant's activities. Endotoxin concentrations were between 10 and 300 EU. m- 3 in the plant. Exposure was further assessed by identifying the predominant culturable fungi (allergenic Mucor fuscus and Penicillium sp.) and by measuring particle size distributions (cascade impactor). Airborne fungal entities (spores, mycelium strands and fragments, agglomerates, etc.) were found with aerodynamic diameters from 3 to over 20 µm. A metrological approach was used to fully characterise the culturable fungal aerosols generated during cheese maturing in this plant. The results show that workers are exposed to concentrations of airborne culturable fungi, sometimes very high, throughout the manufacturing process. In addition to fungi, culturable bacteria and endotoxins are also present in the work atmosphere. All these microbial organisms thus contribute in a complex manner to total worker exposure. Despite the lack of both occupational exposure limit values and standardized measuring methods, our results suggest that an immunological risk may occur among workers, especially for cheese-brushers, cheese-washers and packagers who are the most exposed workers in the factory...|$|R
50|$|Castelrosso, {{also called}} Toma Brusca, is a pasteurized whole cow's milk cheese. A rare, semi-hard, ancient cheese, {{it comes from}} the Piedmont region in northwestern Italy. It is similar in {{appearance}} to Castelmagno. It has a natural thick, gray rind smattered with yellow mold, and a dry, crumbly, snowy white paste. The flavor is mild: lactic, buttery, and clean with a gentle, residual tang similar to Lancashire and other English cheddar-styles. It complements Italian condiments such as grape mostarda and chestnut honeys. As it ages it becomes harder and drier, but retains its crumbly characteristic. It is made from whole cow's milk, rennet, salt and milk enzymes and <b>matured</b> in underground <b>cellars</b> on silver fir shelves for about 60 days.|$|R
50|$|Rose and Crown, Wisbech; The {{hotel has}} towered over the fens for nearly 600 years. The Rose and Crown Hotel {{is the best}} example of the {{progress}} of the town with examples of Tudor, Elizabethan, Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian Architecture. The Tidnams owned the hotel until 1932 and imported port, sherries and wine up the River Nene. These were <b>matured</b> in the <b>cellars</b> under the hotel and also in cellars under Bridge Street. These enormous underground chambers were built more than 200 years ago in what had been the cut supplying water to the moat of the medieval castle. The Tidnams distributed their ports, sherries and wines from Wisbech all over Britain and their whiskey brand, Tidnams Tipple, was remembered {{in the name of the}} hotel’s main town bar, Tidnams Tipple Inn, now named ‘Back in Time’.|$|R
40|$|In an {{experiment}} with Rosé wine, 27 different commercial yeasts were tested for {{their influence on}} the amino acid pattern of the wine. Amino acids are precursors for aromatic substances; therefore a large variation of the amino acid values in the wine was expected. Blaufränkisch grapes with 20 ° KMW were <b>matured</b> in the <b>cellar</b> with 27 different commercial yeasts. The fermentation {{was carried out in}} 34 l vessels. The wines were measured for amino acids using an HP 1200 liquid chromatograph and HP-FLD 1100 according to Umagat. The wines showed 13. 5 % alcohol and little residual sugar. The measurement results of the amino acids of the different wines showed large variations. For example, the amount of the amino acid alanine in wine varied from 17 to 138 [*]mg. In particular, the wines of the yeast Pino Type showed the highest amounts of alanine in comparison to the other fermented wines...|$|R
50|$|The cheeses {{are removed}} from the presses and put onto pallets which are then {{immersed}} in a bath of salty water for 2 or 3 hours, according to the size. Salting has several functions: it affects the taste, crust formation and is a preserving agent. The cheeses are then ready to be <b>matured</b> in the <b>cellar</b> where they will lose some weight {{in accordance with the}} age-old tradition of the “Angels’ share”.Cheeses are aged in the vaulted cellars of the abbey where the temperature is maintained at 14 C, with high humidity. They will be turned manually every other day. To maintain the crust and encourage the development of the mould on the surface, the cheeses are again bathed in brine and then rubbed and returned to the shelves to mature. The mould is naturally present in the cellar. When they have attained their optimum maturity, they are packed and labeled by hand. The label conveys important manufacturing information and the best-before date (about 45 days after packing).|$|R
40|$|In this experiment, 27 {{different}} commercial yeasts {{were tested}} for {{their influence on}} the phenols of a rosé wine. The phenols depend primarily on the vine variety, cultivation and cellar processing. This experiment sought to clarify how great {{the influence of the}} yeast on the phenols is. Blaufränkisch grapes with 20 ° KMW were <b>matured</b> in the <b>cellar</b> with 27 different commercial yeasts. The vinification was carried out in 34 [*]l vessels. An HPLC Agilent Technology 1220 (RRLC) with a column of ZORBAX SB-C 18 15 × 2. 1 [*]mm (1. 8 [*]μm) was used for the measurement. 5 [*]μl of the sample were injected directly. The column oven temperature was 40 [*]°C. The transient was 0. 5 % formic acid (pH = 2. 3) and a gradient of methanol (3 %, 4 %, 14 %, 30 % and 70 %). The detection took place at 280 and 320 [*]nm. It was shown that the effect of yeast on phenols is low. There was a great influence on the chemical substance tyrosol. This is a phenol that can be formed by the yeast itself. The values varied between 5. 4 [*]mg and 13. 2 [*]mg/l. The already described influence of the duration of fermentation on tyrosol formation could not be confirmed...|$|R
