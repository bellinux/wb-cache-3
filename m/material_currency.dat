40|$|For coupled {{human and}} natural systems (CHANS), {{sustainability}} {{can be defined}} operationally as a feasible, desirable set of flows (<b>material,</b> <b>currency,</b> information, energy, individuals, etc.) that can be maintained despite internal changes {{and changes in the}} environment. Sustainable development can be defined as the process by which CHANS can be moved toward sustainability. Specific indicators that give insight into the structure and behavior of feedbacks in CHANS are of particular interest because they would aid in the sustainable management of these systems through an understanding of the structures that govern system behavior. However, the use of specific feedbacks as monitoring tools is rare, possibly because of uncertainties regarding the nature of their dynamics and the diversity of types of feedbacks encountered in these systems. An information theory perspective may help to rectify this situation, as evidenced by recent research in sustainability science that supports the use of unit-free measures such as Shannon entropy and Fisher information to aggregate disparate indicators. These measures have been used for spatial and temporal datasets to monitor progress toward sustainability targets. Here, we provide a review of information theory and a theoretical framework for studying the dynamics of feedbacks in CHANS. We propose a combination of information-based indices that might productively inform our sustainability goals, particularly when related to key feedbacks in CHANS...|$|E

At the level of evolutionary ecology, a simultaneous focus on the energetic and material underpinnings of evolutionary tradeoffs and transactions highlights the relationship between the cost of resource acquisition and the functional consequences of biochemical composition. At the macroevolutionary level, a stoichiometric perspective can better operationalize models of adaptive radiation and escalation, and elucidate links between evolutionary innovation and the development of global biogeochemical cycles.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practical investigation {{and analysis of}} traditional materials and processes used {{in the production of}} hand made felt. Specifically, the research examines the potential of certain British wool types that are currently undervalued (and often overlooked in the production of fine craft felt). These wools are frequently referred to as ‘waste’ wools. The research further explores aspects of the UK’s wool economy and the problematic issue of waste wool. The aim being to locate and articulate the creative potential of a selection of these wools within the field of fine felt craft practice, and in so doing raise an awareness of their potential diversity and relevance. The investigation questions felt’s marginal status within the textile hierarchy, and problematizes notions of the familial and self-conscious attributed to felt craft by some of its makers. By examining distinctions between craft and industrial felt production, the research considers both the opportunities and limitations of these relationships within the context of designer maker practice. The purpose and focus of this material-led examination is to develop inventive, progressive methods in fine felt craft and couture application seeking <b>material</b> <b>currency</b> with appropriate use of waste wools for handwork production. The practical experimentation was conducted using a practice-led research approach through which materials and sampling methods emerged within a studio-based environment. The study focuses on the use of carding, wet and dry felting and post felting manipulation of surface design using hand-pleating applications. Whilst not specifically suggesting new techniques in felt-making, the modification of existing processes has formed a central part of the contribution to new knowledge created within the work. Therefore the qualitative nature of the research methodology establishes a new perspective on both the value and integrity of British waste wools for the production of fine craft felt-making. The portfolio of fabrics produced confirmed the suitability of materials for fine craft felt-making and further suggested their appropriateness for product development and use. The fabric prototypes and exposition collection evidence new design concepts, situating the practical investigations in a cultural and critical context and in so doing reposition the material in a more valuable and original light. The sampling process identified key areas for innovation and aesthetic appeal suggesting that further research could be developed using other wools and wool blends. From this thesis emerges a vibrant platform for fresh interpretation and potential for British waste wools in fine craft felt-making, further strengthening the creative interplay between material and technique.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{fundamental}} problem of socialist economies: how to ensure compatibility of financial equilibrium with efficient allocation of resources in a decentralized decision-making system. In order to ensure rational allocation of resources in a decentralized system, it is indispensable to apply marginal pricing of labour, <b>materials</b> and foreign <b>currencies.</b> In order to ensure financial equilibrium on the consumer market the financial system operates with average cost pricing rules, thus violating efficiency rules. Trying to solve this dilemma the constructors of economic reforms of the system give priority to financial equilibrium conditions by using average cost prices and exchange rates and correct them by subsidies differentiated for branches. This leads to bargaining processes and {{to the neglect of}} efficiency rules.

50|$|Mercantilism was {{a policy}} {{followed}} by empires, {{especially in the}} 17th and 18th centuries, forbidding or limiting trade outside the empire. In the 1930s, autarky as a policy goal was sought by Nazi Germany, which maximized trade within its economic bloc and minimized external trade, particularly with the then world powers such as Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, with which it expected {{to go to war}} and consequently could not rely upon. The economic bloc wherein trade was maximized comprised countries that were economically weak—namely, those in South America, the Balkans, and eastern Europe (Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary)—and had raw materials vital to Germany's growth. Trade with these countries, which was negotiated by then Minister of Economics Hjalmar Schacht, was based on the exchange of German manufactured produce directly for these <b>materials</b> rather than <b>currency,</b> allowing Schacht to barter without reliance on the strength of the Reichsmark. However, although food imports fell significantly between 1932 and 1937, Germany's rapid rearmament policy after 1935 proved contradictory to the Nazi Party autarkic ambitions and imports of raw materials rose by 10% over the same period. German armament spending went from under 2% of gross national product in 1933 to over 23% in 1939. Germany also relied upon ersatz or synthetic substitutes, such as nitrile rubber or oil obtained through coal liquefaction.|$|R

[...] In 1974 hundred million dollars out of 200 million dollars’ current exports is the export of German coal. Ten {{millions}} tons of coal should be used inside Germany to serve the converting industries and can therefore not get exported furthermore. There is a wide gap between necessary imports and exports to pay for raw material and food deficiencies. But even in 1947 Germany could resume her pre-war role as manufacturer of producer goods, which impressed the visitors of two splendid export exhibitions at Munich and Stuttgart. Re-sellers who knew their markets would have been glad to buy and distribute German goods. Brown recommended, that nations, which would re-establish the trade with Germany, should give parts of their currency to the International Bank for loaning this money to German industrialists. They could pay their loans back by export to these nations. [...] Freedom should as well be given to two- or tripartite barter arrangements. The primitive method of barter can quickly bring about an exchange of goods in absence of foreign currency.

40|$|As Graham Pryor {{observed}} in 2012, “Technology has enabled data {{to become the}} prevalent <b>material</b> and <b>currency</b> of research”, replacing information and publications as its accepted deliverable, and presenting significant challenges for academic libraries and information literacy practitioners – though many librarians have built on experience with social science and geospatial datasets in responding to research data agenda. But the data deluge extends beyond academic research, with data also hailed as the new currency and form of exchange in the business world; similarly, in healthcare, education, and the public sector, a philosophy of open data to improve transparency is being espoused by governments {{around the world and}} international bodies such as OECD. The current trend is Big Data 2. 0, which converges e-science with business intelligence, crowdsourcing, data analytics, social media and Web 2. 0 technologies to create very large-scale interdisciplinary human-subject research programs, often involving public- and private-sector partnerships operating across multiple jurisdictions and different cultures. These megaprojects bring another level of technical and organizational complexity to data-intensive research, and raise additional policy, legal, and ethical issues that resonate with the professional and personal values of information specialists. Librarians are extending their information literacy instruction into the research data arena, with many case studies published in the past five years, including initiatives targeting researchers as well as students (Carlson & Bracke, 2015; Doucette & Fyfe, 2013; Haendel et al., 2012; Peters & Vaughn, 2013). Some practitioners have developed curricula to prepare graduates for working with data in employment, notably in business and public health (Macy & Coates, 2016). Public libraries are also helping people navigate the opportunities and threats of the new data landscape (Emmelhain, 2015). Scholars have discussed definitions and competencies for data literacy, usually with reference to research data (Koltay, 2015; Schneider, 2013), although Prado and Marzal’s (2013) framework includes public sector data and targets academic, school, and public librarians. Commentators variously see data literacy as complementary to or a component of information literacy, but agree the concepts are closely related; Schield (2004) argues that statistical literacy is an essential dimension of both data literacy and information literacy. Our research has a broad scope to gain more complete understanding of the evolving phenomenon of data literacy and its meaning for librarians. Three questions guided our investigation: • What {{does it mean to be}} data literate in a world of massive open online data and continuous participatory research programs? • Where should librarians concentrate their efforts to create real value for the individuals and communities they serve? • How can the profession collaborate to make a difference in our fast-moving data-rich society? We used a collective case-study strategy based on secondary data from other related research and our prior work. Our analysis confirms the need for librarians to: expand information and data literacy programs to cover data in multiple contexts (education, the workplace, and our personal lives); assume a critical role in developing policies and practices supporting data privacy; and work across traditional boundaries to promote ethical use of data in the digital world...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{research}} on {{the application of the}} physical dosimetry techniques of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and luminescence (optically stimulated luminescence, OSL, and thermoluminescence, TL) to determine radiation dose following catastrophic, large-scale radiological events. Such data are used in dose reconstruction to obtain estimates of dose due to the exposure to external sources of radiation, primarily gamma radiation, by individual members of the public and by populations. The EPR and luminescence techniques have been applied {{to a wide range of}} radiological studies, including nuclear bomb detonation (e. g., Hiroshima and Nagasaki), nuclear power plant accidents (e. g., Chernobyl), radioactive pollution (e. g., Mayak plutonium facility), and in the future could include terrorist events involving the dispersal of radioactive materials. In this review we examine the application of these techniques in ‘emergency’ and ‘retrospective’ modes of operation that are conducted on two distinct timescales. For emergency dosimetry immediate action to evaluate dose to individuals following radiation exposure is required to assess deterministic biological effects and to enable rapid medical triage. Retrospective dosimetry, on the other hand, contributes to the reconstruction of doses to populations and individuals following external exposure, and contributes to the long-term study of stochastic processes and the consequential epidemiological effects. Although internal exposure, via ingestion of radionuclides for example, can be a potentially significant contributor to dose, this review is confined to those dose components arising from exposure to external radiation, which in most studies is gamma radiation. The nascent emergency dosimetry measurement techniques aim to perform direct dose evaluations for individuals who, as members of the public, are most unlikely to be carrying a dosimeter issued for radiation monitoring purposes in the event of a radiation incident. Hence attention has focused on biological or physical materials they may have in their possession that could be used as surrogate dosimeters. For EPR measurements, in particular, this includes material within the body (such as bone or tooth biopsy) requiring invasive procedures, but also materials collected non-invasively (such as clippings taken from finger- or toenails) and artefacts within their personal belongings (such as electronic devices of which smart phones are the most common). For luminescence measurements, attention has also focused on components within electronic devices, including smartphones, and a wide range of other personal belongings such as paper and other polymer-based <b>materials</b> (including <b>currency,</b> clothing, bank cards, etc.). The paper reviews progress made using both EPR and luminescence techniques, along with their current limitations. For the longer-established approach of retrospective dosimetry, luminescence has been the most extensively applied method and, by employing minerals found in construction materials, it consequently is employed in dosimetry using structures within the environment. Recent developments in its application to large-scale radiation releases are discussed, including the atomic bomb detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, fallout from the Chernobyl reactor and atmospheric nuclear bomb tests within the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site and fluvially transported pollution within the Techa River basin due to releases from the Mayak facility. The developments made in applying OSL and TL techniques are discussed in the context of these applications. EPR measurements with teeth have also provided benchmark values to test the dosimetry models used for Chernobyl liquidators (clean-up workers), residents of Semipalatinsk Nuclear Tests Sites and inhabitants of the Techa River basin. For both emergency and retrospective dosimetry applications, computational techniques employing radiation transport simulations based on Monte Carlo code form an essential component in the application of dose determinations by EPR and OSL to dose reconstruction problems. We include in the review examples where the translation from the physical quantity of cumulative dose determined in the sampled medium to a dose quantity that can be applied in the reconstruction of dose to individuals and/or populations; these take into account the source terms, release patterns and the movements of people in the affected areas. One role for retrospective luminescence dosimetry has been to provide benchmark dose determinations for testing the models employed in dose reconstruction for exposed populations, notably at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The discussion is framed within the context of the well-known radiation incidents mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|Common discourses around jazz {{generally}} {{acknowledge the}} centrality of creativity to the music, but scholarship on what precisely creativity is in jazz, and how it might best be enhanced is not well developed. Building on the important {{work in this area}} begun by scholars such as Ed Sarath and R. Keith Sawyer, I first investigate the extensive scholarly literature on creativity, drawing predominantly from social science and education contexts, and then apply some of the most relevant frameworks to jazz. These frameworks draw several key aspects of jazz practice into sharp relief, in particular the respective roles of individuals and ensembles and the ways they work in common, and the provenance of musical materials in creative jazz practice. With these key ideas acting as a theoretical lens, I view the historical practice of three unquestionably creative jazz musicians: Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Duke Ellington. The choice of these musicians in particular is important because their example, when understood through the lens of creativity, in part authenticates some of the traditional tools by which we investigate jazz, historically, {{while at the same time}} pointing towards some different, less commonly discussed attributes. Most important, the creativity lens reveals important ways in which creative practice can be attributable to understandable procedures that are available to all accomplished musicians, not just a few “great men”. Thus my conclusions call into question more traditional modes of jazz history and criticism which, while acknowledging the music’s collective nature, tend to emphasise the roles of individuals as primary in jazz. Instead, my research suggests that creativity is best achieved in group contexts where diversely gifted participants work collaboratively in egalitarian, interactive, improvised settings. Individuals do make significant contributions to this mix, and in terms of creative advances in jazz – and in terms of achieving meaningful self-expression – the most important quality individual musicians can pursue is the development and expression of unique musical voices. In addition to improvised interactivity among unique individual voices, the adoption of musical materials from outside of jazz and their transformations (along with similar transformations of musical <b>materials</b> already common <b>currency</b> among jazz musicians) can be shown to serve both the expressive goals of musicians and propel jazz in creative and potentially fruitful directions. It is the improvised colloquy of such individual voices, transforming received and newly acquired musical materials in the service of self-expression, that contributed to the lasting allure of the music attributed to Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Duke Ellington. Saxophonist Jan Garbarek is proposed as a contemporary musician who has made use of all of these strategies in forging jazz music that demonstrates fidelity to the core processes of jazz while only provisionally embracing some of the style features of earlier forms of the music – style features that common jazz discourses have tended to emphasise at the expense of the processes that gave rise to them...|$|R
