5000|$|Typically {{based on}} the {{platform}} of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the US the term [...] "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" [...] is used, in the UK the term [...] "Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)" [...] is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term [...] "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" [...] is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or <b>mine</b> <b>ploughs,</b> a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes or lifting booms.|$|R

50|$|FV 4003 Centurion Mk 5 AVRE 165: (1963) - AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers) {{vehicle with}} a 165 mm {{demolition}} gun {{with a range}} of about 2,000 yards and firing a 60 lb HESH projectile for breaching obstacles. It was fited with a hydraulically operated dozer blade or a <b>mine</b> <b>plough</b> and could carry a fascine bundle or a roll of metal Class 60 Trackway, tow the Viper mine-clearance equipment or a trailer. This variant had a five-man crew and was used in the 1991 Gulf War.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} that this tank project was abandoned, as with other heavy tank projects, was that the Soviet {{military}} stopped operating with heavy fighting vehicles of that type, tanks and similar, as of 1960. Since then, the heaviest ones are kept at about 50 metric tons of weight, that is without counting in any extra equipment such as additional reactive armor, mine clearing devices (<b>mine</b> <b>ploughs,</b> <b>mine</b> rollers) etc. It was something concerning the current Soviet policy ("А 22 июля 1960 г. на демонстрации новой техники на полигоне Капустин Яр Н. С. Хрущев категорически запретил прием на вооружение любых танков массой более 37 т, тем самым поставив крест на всей программе тяжелых танков, оказавшейся столь результативной" [...] / On July 22, 1960, at the demonstration of new technology on the range of Kapustin Yar, Nikita Khrushchev strictly forbade any tanks with a weight of more than 37 metric tons to be adopted by the military, having thus written off the entire program of heavy tanks that had proven to be so successful).|$|R
50|$|These {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} mechanical or other means for the breaching of man made obstacles. Common types of breaching vehicles include mechanical flails, <b>mine</b> <b>plough</b> vehicles, and mine roller vehicles. In some cases, these vehicles will also mount Mine-clearing line charges. Breaching vehicles may be either converted armoured fighting vehicles or purpose built vehicles. In larger militaries, converted AFV {{are likely to be}} used as assault breachers while the breached obstacle is still covered by enemy observation and fire, and then purpose built breaching vehicles will create additional lanes for following forces.|$|E
5000|$|The most prosperous of all early copper mining {{was done}} at the Pueblo mine, staked by John Hanly in 1898. [...] It was located along the Fish Lake Rd. The <b>mine</b> was <b>ploughed</b> over in 1986 {{to make way for}} the Icy Waters fish farm.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{versions}} {{that did}} not see active service were equipped with anti-mine <b>ploughs,</b> <b>mine</b> rollers, or special demolition charges to destroy reinforced concrete walls.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{engineering}} AFV's utilize chassis {{based on}} main battle tank platforms: these vehicles are as well armoured and protected as tanks, {{designed to keep}} up tanks, conduct obstacle breaching operations to help tanks get to wherever it needs to be, perform utility functions necessary to expedite mission objectives of tanks, and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. These vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the United States the term [...] "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" [...] is used, in the United Kingdom the term [...] "Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)" [...] is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term [...] "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" [...] is used.

50|$|Canada sent a {{squadron}} of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) to Afghanistan {{in the fall of}} 2006, equipped with 15 Leopard C2 tanks with add-on armour, as well as four recovery vehicles and four engineering vehicles. The armoured squadron was intended to provide convoy protection, supporting Canada's Provincial Reconstruction Teams and other organizations equipped with lighter vehicles, and combat operations. The first tanks arrived in Kandahar in mid-October 2006. On 2 December 2006, the Leopards stationed in Kandahar entered the field, marking {{the first time since the}} Korean War that a Canadian armoured squadron had sent tanks into an active war zone, and fired their guns in combat for the first time in as many years on the following day in response to a Taliban rocket attack. The deployed tank squadron was in combat operations from late 2006 till July 2011. The first squadron deployed just with C-2 MEXAS; then, in mid July 2007, a thermal cover and a cooling unit with crew vests was added to the tanks. The tank squadron was augmented in mid September 2007 with the 20 Leopard 2A6Ms with slat bar type armour, then with the Barracudda system added mid-2008. In late 2010, the tank squadron added five of the new Leopard 2A4Ms. The tank squadron operated with the three different Leopards until it was pulled from combat operations. The C-2 MEXAS with the <b>mine</b> <b>ploughs,</b> <b>mine</b> rollers and the dozers were used alongside the Leopard 2's, until a bracket was installed for the Leopard 2A6M to mount them.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mine</b> plow (<b>plough</b> in British English) is a tank-mounted device {{designed}} {{to clear a}} lane through a minefield, allowing other vehicles to follow. Buried land mines are plowed up and pushed outside the tank's track path or tipped over. Since modern anti-tank mines rely on a focused explosion to destroy a tank, they are useless when turned upside-down; as the tank runs over the mine, it will expend its blast down instead of upwards, causing insignificant damage, if any.|$|R
50|$|India is re-organising its {{mechanised}} {{forces to}} achieve strategic mobility and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. At present, the Indian army has severe deficiencies in its artillery (particularly self-propelled guns) and ammunition stocks, {{not to mention}} the inability of some of its modern tanks to operate in the heat and dust of the desert regions around the international border. India proposes to progressively induct as many as 248 Arjun MBT and to develop and induct the Arjun MK-II variant, 1,657 Russian-origin T-90S main-battle tanks, apart from the ongoing upgrade of its T-72 fleet. Arjun MK-II trials had already begun in August 2013. The improved features of the MK-II version of Arjun are night vision capabilities with a thermal imaging system for detecting all kinds of missiles, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA), <b>mine</b> <b>ploughs,</b> the ability to fire anti-tank missiles with its 120 mm main gun, an Advanced Air Defence gun capable of shooting down helicopters with a 360 degree coverage, Automatic Target Tracking (ATT) lending a greater accuracy when it comes to moving targets and superior Laser Warning and Control systems. The Indian Army will upgrade its entire Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty-2 (BMP-2)/2K infantry combat vehicle (ICV) fleet to enhance their ability to address operational requirements. Upgrades include integration of the latest generation fire control system, twin missile launchers and commander's thermal imaging panoramic sights, anti- tank guided missiles, as well as automatic grenade launchers.|$|R
40|$|We live in {{the midst}} of animals; the {{products}} of their bodies and products made from their bodies are everywhere. Over thousands of years we have used these beings for our own ends; for hauling loads, grinding grain, making roads, carrying people, working in <b>mines,</b> powering machinery, <b>ploughing</b> land and making war. Each day of the year we kill, on average, in the food industry alone, the same number of animals as {{there are people in the}} whole of southern Africa. Animals have been our unpaid, unacknowledged and, for the most part, appallingly treated slaves, on whose backs, it is no exaggeration to say, our present world has been built. Perhaps it is time to consider our relationship with them. For this book we originally asked Quakers and people attending Quaker Meetings to write about ‘seeing animals differently’ and our contributors are Friends or attenders or people who have some association with Friends. The authors {{live in the}} UK, South Africa, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia and the United States. There is a saying that trying to organise Quakers is like trying to herd cats and the diversity in this small book clearly bears this out. We An introduction to the book Pauline and Les Mitchell Introduction have not made any attempt to impose uniformity or to ask authors to write to any formula, which means that what you read carries the original voice and style of the contributor. We feel that, rather than a weakness, this is a strength of the collection and shows how diverse yet interwoven our perspectives can be...|$|R
