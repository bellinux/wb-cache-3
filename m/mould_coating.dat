An alumina based <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> containing varying proportion (5 % to 30 %) of volatile hexachloroethane, C 2 Cl 6 was prepared. The prepared <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> was applied to form a coat of 2 mm thick on the prepared metallic mould.

The study revealed that the increase in C 2 Cl 6 concentration in the <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> up to 15 wt. % decreases the grain size of the alloy thereby causing increase in the mechanical properties (UTS), 0. 2 % proof stress, hardness, percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area) of the alloy. It was established that the optimum value of C 2 Cl 6 concentration at which the mechanical properties were optimum is about 15 wt. %. Beyond this value, the C 2 Cl 6 becomes deleterious to grain refinement due to rapid agitation in the mould...|$|E

In this research, the effect of two mould runner gating systems and <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> on graphite nodule characteristics and hardness value of TWDI casting was studied. Strip samples with various thicknesses of 2. 3, 3. 3, 4. 5, 5. 4, 6. 5, 7. 5 and 8. 5 mm were cast into CO 2 silicate mould designed with two different stepped and tapered runners.

In {{order to improve}} its wear resistance, an unbalanced magnetron sputtering PVD compositional monolayered coating has been produced. The film was composed by a nanostructured TiB 2 monolayer. Microstructure characterization and thickness evaluation were conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Film topography and roughness were accessed by SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The phase analyse was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using Cu Kalpha radiation. Scratch tests were conducted in order to study the film adhesion to the substrate.

40|$|In this paper, {{an initial}} {{assessment}} of the quality parameters of the surface finish and dimensional accuracy of tools made by metal casting in rapid prototyping (RP) sand moulds is undertaken. A case study from a local tool room, dealing with the manufacturing of an aluminium die for the lost wax process, is employed. Modern techniques, including surface roughness analysis and three dimensional scanning, are used to determine and understand how each manufacturing step influences the final quality of the cast tool. The best surface finish obtained for the cast die had arithmetic average roughness (Ra) and mean average roughness (Rz) respectively equal to 3. 23 µm and 11. 38 µm. In terms of dimensional accuracy, 82 % of cast-die points coincided with the Computer Aided Design (CAD) data, which is within the typical tolerances of sand cast products.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to substitute wet chemical mould coatings in the plastic and rubber processing by PVD and CVD coatings. Suitable mould coatings should show good demoulding characteristics, a positive wear-resistance and advantageous corrosion attributes. To judge the demoulding performance, trials with laboratory moulds were made and a demoulding device was built, enabling you to measure demoulding forces directly. PVD and CVD coatings showed reduced (up to 20 - 25 %) demoulding forces compared with uncoated and galvanic chrome coated moulds. The influence of mould release agents are significantly stronger than the influence of different mould coatings. Due to the 2 to 4 times (TiC) higher micro hardness (Vickershardness) of PVD and CVD coatings compared with hardened steal and galvanic chrome, a higher wear-resistance of the moulds had been achieved. This helps against abrasive parts of the rubber formulation and abrasive mould cleaning. A higher corrosion resistance of some CVD and PVD coatings had been proved by extensive laboratory trials and corrosion tests as well as long term production use. CVD coatings and multilayers with CVD basic coatings are clearly more corrosion resistant than galvanic chrome coatings.

40|$|Micro {{structured}} {{optical plastics}} components are intensively used i. e. in consumer electronics, for optical sensors in metrology, innovative LED-lighting or laser technology. Injection moulding {{has proven to}} be successful for the large-scale production of those parts. However, the production of those parts still causes difficulties due to challenges in the moulding and demoulding of plastics parts created with laser structured mould inserts. A complete moulding of the structures often leads to increased demoulding forces, which then cause a breaking of the structures and a clogging of the mould. An innovative approach is to combine PVD-coated (physical vapour deposition), laser structured inserts and a variothermal moulding process to create functional mic 8 iuro structures in a one-step process. Therefore, a PVD-coating is applied after the laser structuring process in order to improve the wear resistance and the anti-adhesive properties against the plastics melt. In a series of moulding trials with polycarbonate (PC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) using different coated moulds, the mould temperature during injection was varied in the range of the glass transition and the melt temperature of the polymers. Subsequently, the surface topography of the moulded parts is evaluated by digital 3 D laser-scanning microscopy. The influence of the moulding parameters and the coating of the mould insert on the moulding accuracy and the demoulding behaviour are being analysed. It is shown that micro structures created by ultra-short pulse laser ablation can be successfully replicated in a variothermal moulding process.

40|$|The {{fluidity}} of an alloy plays a {{key role}} for the foundry and transport industries as it affects the quality and soundness of the cast products. Particularly, fluidity influences the reject rates, hence casting costs and the production of thinwalled, hence light components. Fluidity is a complex technological property and depends on many parameters. However, many aspects of this subject are still not fully understood. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various parameters on the fluidity of aluminium foundry alloys and, in particular, Al-Si foundry alloys. A literature review of previously reported results on fluidity was carried out. It was found that a lack of a highly reproducible test method as well as some contradictory results existed in the literature. Therefore, a new fluidity test method was developed. To study the accuracy and reproducibility of this test was {{one of the goals of}} this work. The new test method allowed a constant melt superheat, which is considered as one of the major factors affecting fluidity measurements, and a constant pouring velocity. It was found that the reproducibility of the new method was higher than previous methods. The effect of casting temperature, and hence melt superheat, was assessed through a series of tests. A linear relationship between casting temperature and fluidity length was observed. The effect of grain refiner on the fluidity of an A 356 alloy was systematically investigated. The fluidity lengths without grain refiner and with three additions of Al- 5 wt%Ti- 1 wt%B master alloy were measured. The results showed that grain refinement reduced the grain size throughout the spiral somewhat, particularly at the tip, but there were no statistically significant effects on fluidity. The effect of dissolved hydrogen was also investigated in this study. The hydrogen content was drastically increased by plunging pieces of wood beneath the surface of the molten metal. The fluidity of this melt was measured and compared to a melt with low hydrogen content. It was concluded that the difference in fluidity between the melts with different hydrogen levels was not significant. The effect of minor alloying elements (Sr, Ti, Fe and Mg) on the fluidity of Al- 7 wt%Si alloys was investigated. The Design Of Experiment (DOE) technique and the Taguchi approach were used to design the experiments. The Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyse the results. It was concluded that the addition of minor alloying elements to a major alloy system, e. g. Al- 7 wt%Si, does not significantly affect its fluidity and the melt superheat had a far greater impact on fluidity than the minor alloying elements. The effect of <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> on fluidity was studied on a commercial strip mould which consisted of a H 13 die with five channels of different cross sectional areas. The coating was sprayed to achieve a thickness of 0. 2 mm. Fluidity measurements were performed on the uncoated and coated mould. It was concluded that <b>mould</b> <b>coating</b> significantly increases fluidity. In addition, fluidity measurements on the uncoated and coated mould were undertaken at two different melt superheats and it was found that coating the mould plays a more significant role at low melt superheats. The effect of oxide content on fluidity was also investigated. Three alloys, namely a standard A 356 alloy, the same alloy with 20 % (A 356 + 20 %) and 50 % (A 356 + 50 %) re-melted turning chips, were used and their fluidities compared. Qualitative analysis on the type of oxides present in the three alloys was carried out with a PoDFA test apparatus and the oxide level was quantified with optical microscopy analysis. The results showed that the addition of turning chips significantly increased the oxide content. Among the investigated alloys, A 356 without turning chip additions showed the lowest oxide content and the highest fluidity. No significant differences in either oxide content or fluidity were found between the A 356 + 20 % and A 356 + 50 % melts. Two fluidity test methods, a commercially available one and an experimentally developed test, were used for measuring the fluidity of Al-Mg-Si alloys. Although the two methods were different, they gave consistent results. Numerical simulations of fluidity tests were carried out on an A 356 alloy and the results showed that numerical simulation software can be a useful tool for predicting fluidity in aluminium foundry alloys. These are the major findings achieved by this thesis work which contribute to improve our understanding of the effect of several key variables on fluidity. It is believed that these results will solve some of the problems currently encountered in foundries and improve their processes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{sand casting}} {{is a well}} {{understood}} method to produce metal shapes and {{has been used for}} many years in industry. It is a relatively simple method but has a significant drawback, with the requirement of a pattern to form the internal cavity. Patterns are produced at high cost through Computer Numerical Controlled machining or wood pattern making with significantly high lead times. Rapid Prototyping is seen as a solution to this problem, with the ability to produce sand moulds directly from Computer Aided Design platforms and thus eliminate the requirement of a pattern. Through layered manufacturing, the sand mould can be produced with complex internal geometry directly, minimising labour costs and involving short waiting times. While initial research was mainly concerned with the use of Selective Laser Sintering, with the advent of 3 D printing, pattern-less sand moulds can be produced more easily and cheaply. With the process gaining more and more popularity, there was a need to scientifically assess the suitability of the process for sand casting as well as, establish influences of typical process parameters on significant responses. Critical mould properties, such as permeability and compressive strength, were investigated with respect to varying time and temperature of baking. To this end, mathematical models of permeability and compressive strength were developed. Also, the influence of mould material, <b>mould</b> <b>coating,</b> alloy type and pouring temperatures were investigated in static sand casting of light metals. Further work utilised the centrifugal casting process using these 3 D printed moulds to establish links between process factors, such as rotational speed and cast strength using light metals. Compressive strength results for the rapidly produced materials were acceptable compared to traditional values. Permeability was however lower than commonly used foundry sand. Results showed, nevertheless, that permeability and compressive strength were both improved by baking times and temperatures. Significant model effects were established for ZP 131 and ZCast 501 with respect to increased compressive strength and mould permeability. Multi-factorial experiments involving simultaneous variation of factors such as mould materials, surface coatings, alloys and pouring temperatures were conducted and static casting results in general show good as-cast mechanical properties with the factors having significant effects on surface roughness, percent elongation and hardness. Centrifugal casting of aluminium alloys initially produced below average tensile properties, due to the large presence of hydrogen porosity. However, upon degassing, much improved tensile strengths were obtained, being superior to both static casting and traditionally sand cast aluminium. Also a Magnesium alloy was successfully trialled with the centrifugal process using 3 D printed moulds in spite of numerous practical difficulties. Substantial data relating to the process factors for mould materials and casting processes was produced. Analysis of factor influences facilitated optimum process configurations for the production of moulds and castings. These combinations of factors at optimum levels comprehensively showed that light metals such as aluminium and magnesium alloys could be successfully processed by rapidly produced moulds, both statically and centrifugally...|$|E

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{composite}} manufacturing process that would be able to deliver Class A surface finished products in the context of mould manufacturing methods. The problem required solving was to overcome the time needed to prepare Class A surfaces, by developing a composite manufacturing process that will deliver Class A surface finished products straight from the mould. The process was aimed at the entire development process, from mould and plug design up to the finished product. A literature study and a factory mould survey were conducted with a view to obtain the necessary insights into surface finishing and composite manufacturing. These surveys were followed by seven constructional tests which determined the most appropriate solutions for the proposed manufacturing processes. Test 1 was used to determine a quality finish standard for composites from the sanding grits used to finished composite surfaces versus surface roughness values used in other industries. The standard determined that a P 800 finish has a roughness between 0. 200 and 0. 150 um and constitutes a Class A 3 finish. P 1000 to P 1200 have a roughness between 0. 150 um to 0. 100 um and constitutes a Class A 2 finish. Finally a P 2000 and higher have a roughness of 0. 100 um and lower and constitutes Class A 1 surface finish. After the standard was set, the tests for finishing of the moulds, plugs and parts commenced. Test 2 was conducted on the CNC manufacturing of plugs out of Nuceron 651 tooling board. Tool path parameters were varied in a matrix. The samples with the best surface finish value were cut with a step-over of 0. 5 and feed of 800 mm/min. These parameters were found to be the most influential. Test 2 and 4 revealed that the plug surface finishing should commence with conventional 2 K paint finishing, with a possibility of acrylic split surface. This process produced projected mould surfaces between 0. 150 um and 0. 200 um, which can be categorised as Class A- 3. Test 5 and 6 determined methods for improving the mould surface quality and durability. It was established that the tooling gelcoat should be applied whilst being heated and backed with at least two layers of glass veil and a steady increase of GSM of structural glass fibres to prevent print-through. Test 3 determined that the mould corners could be strengthened with rovings pressed into the corner. It was also established that the moulds surfaces will require finishing after demoulding. The final moulds were manufactured from a fibreglass composite structure with tooling gelcoat surface. A number of guidelines and a set process were developed in order to produce moulds with a surface finish of average 0. 9 um, equivalent to Class A 1. Release agents were tested in Test 7, and the Loctite Frekote 770 -NC release system was deemed appropriate for use with In <b>Mould</b> <b>Coating</b> (IMC) of 2 K Paint. These elements were all synthesised into plug, mould and part manufacturing processes. The proposed processes were validated by the manufacturing of a JS instrument panel, which delivered a Class A 2, 0. 175 um, finish with IMC of 2 K paint. With only a minor sanding of P 3000 grit and polishing, the part was made into a Class A 1 surface, measured at 0. 63 um. The study proved that it is possible to produce Class A finished part with IMC. This method can provide a solution aimed at the elimination of P 600 and lower finishing of composite parts manufactured with IMC. Master...|$|E
40|$|In die casting, heat {{transfer}} {{is controlled by}} the properties of the casting-die interface, due to the high thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the die. Higher {{heat transfer}} rates result in higher productivity in the die casting process along with finer microstructure with superior part qualities. In die casting processes, the use of numerical simulation to predict the mould filling, solidification, and the distribution of temperature in the die has become an important development in foundry technology and cast product developments. The effectiveness of the simulation is dependent on the accuracy of the heat transfer data at the metal-mould boundary used in the simulation software. For these reasons, accurate knowledge about the heat transfer between the casting and the die during the die casting process has become an important issue for most researchers in this field. This investigation studies the interfacial heat transfer during the casting and solidification of light alloys in Gravity (GDC) and High Pressure (HPDC) Die Casting processes. Suitable experimental methods and sensors have been developed that enable the measurement of temperatures, in-cavity pressure and a range of process parameters. Heat Transfer Gauges have been manufactured, accurately calibrated and integrated into the dies for both investigated processes. These gauges measure the casting surface temperature with a pyrometric chain and the temperature through the die wall at different depths with very thin K-type thermocouples. Extensive industrial trials were performed using Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg, A- 9 Si- 3 Cu and AZ 91 D alloys. From the temperature measurements, the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) and heat flux density (q) at the casting-die interface have been evaluated using an inverse method. The obtained results have been correlated with the process parameters and to the microstructure of the castings for some selected cases. In GDC, the results show that the applied coating on the die surface governs the heat transfer during solidification of the casting through its low effective thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductivity of the coating is determined by the high level of porosity in its structure. For this reason, its chemical composition has a very limited influence on the peak value of heat transfer. However, the coating composition does influence the variation of the heat transfer coefficient with time during solidification. The variation of HTC at the castingdie interface has been divided into three main stages according to the conditions of contact during casting and solidification: liquid-solid, semisolid-solid and solid-solid contact. The HTC at each of these stages is dominated by different process parameters. A secondary peak {{in the evolution of the}} HTC has been observed at the end of the semisolid-solid stage. This secondary peak was attributed to the exudation of solute rich eutectic liquid onto the surface region of the casting enabling fresh liquid contact with the <b>mould</b> <b>coating.</b> In HPDC the value of the HTC is much larger than that determined in GDC ((105 Wm- 2 K- 1 compared to 103 Wm- 2 K- 1 in GDC). The variation of HTC with time is also very rapid since the heat flux density is much greater than that in GDC. The rapid variation of the HTC is attributed to the degradation of contact between the casting and the die occurring during solidification. The second stage velocity and the impact pressure caused by the sudden deceleration of the piston as the cavity was filled have a significant influence on the interfacial heat transfer during HPDC. This impact pressure is different from the intensification pressure which is applied during the third stage of the casting process. The values of the peak heat transfer coefficient showed no dependence on intensification pressure in our trials. Analytical models have been developed to predict the thermal contact resistance (TCR) at the liquid-solid interface in general. Contact topography and interface characteristics are included in the model through die surface roughness and the mean trapped air layer between the casting and the die. The mean trapped air layer is determined from the mechanisms of contact at the liquid-solid interface. Two different contact mechanisms have been considered; liquid-porous solid and liquid-non porous solid contact. In the liquid-non porous case, the air is trapped and compressed inside the microcavities. However, when the solid surface is porous, the air is not trapped and can escape through the pores. In this situation, the contact conditions are determined by the pressure, surface tension of the liquid and the surface roughness characteristics of the die or coating. The proposed models determine the radius and the density of the microcontact points for a given condition of contact. The density and the radius of contact spots have been integrated into a classical thermal flux tube theory in order to calculate HTC at the casting-die interface. The models have been applied to the casting-die interface in GDC and HPDC. The calculated TCR is found to agree well with the experimentally determined results. The models provide valuable information about the role of the casting-die interface in heat transfer during GDC and HPDC processes. The results show that the effect of the measured parameters such as pressure and roughness on the HTC at the casting-die depends on the mechanisms of contact. For HPDC, the evolution of the HTC with time has been associated with the presence of a rapidly solidified region on the casting surface which forms early during solidification due to the high thermal gradient. However, in GDC the relatively low thermal gradients are associated with microstructures more consistent with the formation of a mushy zone across the casting...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn recent years the use of polymers has become increasingly significant in almost all areas of industry. Polyurethanes in particular can be produced in an extremely large range of formulations, and {{with a wide range}} of properties. The research carried out here was based on polyurethane foams used within the automotive industry for seating and insulation. One of the biggest problems facing the manufacturers of polyurethane foam is that of releasing a part from its mould without causing damage to either the part or the mould itself. Traditional methods of manufacture involve the use of a steel or aluminium <b>mould,</b> <b>coated</b> with a sacrificial, normally wax-based, release agent in order to allow effective part removal. Various environmental and financial issues are associated with the use of these release agents, and this research, therefore, aimed to provide an alternative to their use. Many companies use moulds manufactured from polymeric materials for short run production, and occasionally it has been observed that in certain cases a PU foam part can be released without using a sacrificial release agent. However, the issue of predicting release of PU foam from a polymer mould is something of a 'black art', and in most cases a company will continue to use a sacrificial release agent in order to prevent any possibility of parts sticking in the mould. The author of this work has shown that the low surface energy of a polymer allows un-aided polyurethane foam release under certain conditions. It has also been shown that, contrary to a large school of thought, the roughness of the substrate had a large effect on the ability of a polymer surface to release. The foam composition was also significant. Crucially it has been shown that, given the input of the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not un-aided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This model will provide a company with the ability to identify possible polymeric mould materials, and levels of finishing for these moulds, which have the potential to allow un-aided release of polyurethane parts...|$|R

Meanwhile, the new face coats should also have excellent sintering properties, chemical inertness, surface finish and be easy to prepare. The processes of developing the new slurry started with the filler powder investigation by adding different sintering additives into the yttria powder to achieve good sintering properties.
