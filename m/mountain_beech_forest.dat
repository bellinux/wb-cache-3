40|$|Many {{teachers}} of biology in Canterbury enjoy taking their students into <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> for field studies. An oft-expressed complaint {{in the past}} has been the lack of simple, readily available resource material to assist both teacher and student in their study. This book is an attempt by three biology teachers to fill this gap. The book has three aims. The first is to introduce the reader to the mountain beech tree and the beech forest community (including stream ecology). The second is to describe activities which students may use in beech forest. Lastly, the book identifies forest areas in Canterbury where field studies can be conveniently carried out by school groups. The original idea for the book came from the Canterbury Science Teachers' Association. The idea took a step towards becoming reality when financial support was provided by the Environmental Council to C. S. T. A. to produce the book. Teacher release time was provided by the Education Department, support and assistance given by the staff of the Canterbury conservancy of the New Zealand Forest Service and editorial and publication assistance was generously given by the Centre for Resource Management, Lincoln College. In total {{a large number of people}} belonging to a number of different agencies combined together to produce the book. It is hoped that this will not be the only exercise of this kind where educational and scientific agencies in Canterbury combine to produce an educational publication on ecology.

40|$|Summary: Sites in {{four areas}} of Canterbury, New Zealand were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} principal factors influencing wind damage, and study sites at two areas were used to investigate forest age-class structure and stand dynamics. At all sites large-scale topographic features funnelled storm winds to produce recurrent damage, and smaller-scale topographic features determined precise points affected by winthrow. Lee slopes provide shelter to susceptible sites during normal weather conditions and therefore permit better stand growth, but stand damage increases in storms. Stands on exposed windward slopes form a wind-shaped canopy which is constrained by stem breakage during minor storms. Damage occurs in stands over a critical height of about 18 m and where stem diameter is large. Winddamaged forests have restricted age-distribution {{compared with those of}} partially damaged and vulnerable forests. Wind damage is little cause for concern as it must be viewed in a framework of short-term forest stability. Periodic mortality in <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> {{can be seen as a}} regeneration strategy of a lightdemanding species, since it produces ideal conditions for forest perpetuation. Forest collapse, followed by rapid massed regeneration is thus an effective competitive mechanism against a more shade-tolerant canopy species...|$|R

The history of vegetation changes since humans arrived in New Zealand is summarily reconstructed, emphasising the early effects of fire and grazing in European pastoralism in reducing above-ground biomass of tall tussock grasslands that resulted from Polynesian burning of forest. The paper collates available quantitative information on biomass and nutrient pools in soil and vegetation {{at different stages of}} degradation in high country grasslands of South Island. Biomass quantities in different compartments and N, P, K and Ca contents in green shoots of tall tussocks at nine different localities are presented, showing great variation that is not well explained by species or soil differences.

40|$|European beech-dominated {{forests are}} crucial for {{maintaining}} biodiversity in forested mountain landscapes of the European temperate zone. This paper {{presents the results}} of research and assessment of management strategy for mountain beech-dominated forests in the Jeseníky Mountains (Czech Republic). Our approach is based on combining research on historical development of the forest ecosystem, assessment of its current state, and predictions of future dynamics using a forest growth simulation model. Using such a method makes it possible to understand {{the current state of the}} mountain beech-dominated forest ecosystem and predict its future development as a response to specific management strategies. The application of this method is therefore appropriate for assessing the suitability of selected management strategies in mountain protected areas. Our results show that a non-intervention management for <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> in the next 80 years complies with the Natura 2000 requirement to maintain the existing character of the forest habitat. Thus, the current management plan for the beech-dominated forests in the Jeseníky Mountains does not require significant corrections in the context of its conservation targets (i. e. maintaining biodiversity and current character of the forest ecosystem dominated by beech). The results of this study suggest that combining the knowledge on historical development with forest growth simulation can be used as a suitable support tool to assess management strategies for forest habitats in protected areas...|$|E

The streams differed {{with respect to}} algal biomass and detrital inputs, reflecting their location either above the tree-line (Mouse Stream) or flowing through <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> (Tim's Creek). Streambed instability was also higher in the forested site. Quantitative sampling of bryophytes and riffles over 18 months revealed the existence of discrete macroinvertebrate (> 250 µm) and meiofaunal (i. e., 5 % of bryophyte material in their guts. The cranefly Limonia hudsoni was the only taxa that appeared to graze bryophytes extensively.

The importance of bryophytes in affecting energy inputs into streams was finally examined. Algal biomass was higher on structures mimicking bryophytes than stones, and biomass was higher above the tree-line than below. Natural bryophytes trapped more FPOM than riffles, and mimics at Tim's Creek trapped more FPOM than at Mouse Stream. Bryophyte biomass at both sites however was similar, reflecting the ability of these plants to tolerate a wide range of light regimes.

Research was conducted on the survival of one-year-old containerized seedlings in weed-covered sites where different auxiliary measures had been carried out, i. e. the following methods of soil preparation: 1) control area, with no preparation; 2) living forest ground cover (blackberry) removed; 3) living forest ground cover removed and soil tilled to a depth of 10 cm; 4) only the soil tilled. The above treatments were performed with five repetitions each for further statistical processing. Analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference at level p < 0. 05 in initial seedling height, so that this did not considerably affect the influence of the different soil preparations on seedling growth. Half of the planted seedlings were treated with the chemical “Zeba” in order to establish and monitor its effects and needs for its use. The product has a sponge effect underground, meaning that it can absorb and retain moisture in the soil to be used later by the plants. The analysis carried out showed that only in certain elements were there statistically significant differences in one-year-old seedling height increment (annual shoot length) ...|$|R

We used permanent plot data from Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (<b>mountain</b> <b>beech)</b> <b>forest</b> on the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, where the fates of trees on 250 plots of 0. 04 ha were followed, to examine: (1) patterns of size-specific mortality over three consecutive periods spanning 30 years, each characterised by different disturbance, and (2) the strength and direction of neighbourhood crowding effects on sizespecific mortality rates. We found that the size-specific mortality function was U-shaped over the 30 -year period as well as within two shorter periods characterised by small-scale pinhole beetle and windthrow disturbance. During a third period, characterised by earthquake disturbance, tree mortality was less size dependent. Small trees (, 20 cm in diameter) {{were more likely to}} die, in all three periods, if surrounded by a high basal area of larger neighbours, suggesting that sizeasymmetric competition for light was a major cause of mortality. In contrast, large trees ($ 20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die in the first period if they had few neighbours, indicating that positive crowding effects were sometimes important for survival of large trees. Overall our results suggest that temporal variability in size-specific mortality patterns, and positive interactions between large trees, may sometimes need to be incorporated into models of forest dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: The study {{presents}} the results of an investigation of regeneration processes, growth, development and survival of young growth by field measurement and three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structure. The results are based on the ten-year investigation (1998 - 2009) on a permanent experimental plot in a <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> with dead nettle tree (Lamio orvale - Fagetum sylvaticae Ht. 1938) in conditions of passive protection. Materials and Methods: Basic structural indicators were measured (diameter at breast height and height), structural crown elements (size and shape, ground cover crowns) and the occurrence and survival of young growth as the basic conditions of natural regeneration. Particular emphasis in the investigation was paid to the development of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration during the 10 year period. Results and Conclusions: Investigation indicates the occurrence of young growth regeneration cores arising {{as a result of the}} die-back of one dominant beech tree with horizontal crown projections of 145 m 2 which initiated the possibility of natural regeneration. The greatest change occurred in the beech seedling count, whose numbers increased fourfold from 3556 plants per hectare in 1998 to 12694 plants per hectare in 2009. The share of beech seedlings increased from 8. 7 % to 22. 6 % of all species of young growth and shrubs. Thus beech became dominant among the tree species regeneration. However, the majority of the young plants of beech are of poor quality and thus their further development in conditions of passive protection is questionable. The investigations also showed the possibility of a new approach to the study of the dynamics of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration by methods of three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structures. The methods presented offer a more graphic illustration of the development of stands and high quality presentation of the obtained results.

40|$|Background and purpose: It is {{possible}} to monitor and study the natural growth {{and development of the}} forest ecosystems in the example of protected forest stands, which were excluded from management, and which are not under a negative influence of human activity. Therefore the aim of the research through the repeated measurements is to estimate the stand structure development on the Medveđak permanent experimental plot in the Plitvice Lakes national park area. In this paper we presented the first preliminary results of established monitoring, i. e. comparison of results of stand structure elements between two measurements (1998 and 2008). Furthermore, obtained results were compared with data from growth-yield tables for common beech stands similar characteristics as researched stand. In this case data from growth-yield tables present managed pure beech stands. Material and methods: The permanent experimental plot was set in 1998 in the natural stand of <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> (Lamio orvale-Fagetum sylvaticae Ht. 1938). It is in rectangular shape, dimensions 100 × 100 m, with subplot 60 × 60 m and 30 × 30 m. The plot is founded according to the experimental plot setting methodology (Dubravac & Novotny, 1992 and Novotny, 1997) extended on the ICP Forest workgroup demand. Tree crown damage assessment was repeated in 2003, and in June 2008 another measurement of basic stand structural elements was done. Results and Conclusion: The results in this paper show the development of the observed structural elements of the pure beech stand in the natural conditions without the management activities. According to the results of stand structure development (shape of diameter distribution, number of trees, stand basal area and volume) and results obtained in other research at the same plot [9] (number, vitality and quality of beech young growth) it can be concluded that our stand is developing towards the optimum phase of the secondary virgin forest. Furthermore, obtained results (N/ha, G/ha, V/ha) show discrepancies in relation to managed pure beech stand from growth-yield tables. Decrease in the number of trees, increase of the proportion of dead trees and proportion of significantly damaged trees in the monitoring period indicate the decrease of the stand vitality and health. Therefore, the question arises: Should protected forests today be absolutely left to the natural process of growth, development and dying? Since ten years is a brief period for research and conclusions about structural changes in the stand, further research efforts are necessary.

The outlet feeds into the south branch of the Ashburton River / Hakatere. Located in {{the upper reaches of}} the Rangitata River a small village of holiday homes, also called Lake Clearwater, is located between Lake Clearwater and the smaller neighbour Lake Camp. The lake borders, and is proposed to be included in, the Hakatere Conservation Park which covers nearly 60,000 hectares of rugged <b>mountain</b> country, tussocklands, <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> and sparkling clear rivers and lakes between the Rakaia and Rangitata Rivers. The lake has a submerged plant indicator rating of 48 (moderate). The Canterbury University Tramping Club selected this location for their annual T'WALK event on 17 May 2014.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{increased}} use of outdoor recreation {{as a part of}} the American way of life has focused attention on the diminishing ratio of suitable land available to meet the recreational demands. In Oregon, where the demand is greatest, there is still ample undeveloped land for recreation use. There exists, therefore a need to study and evaluate the land from the standpoint of its development and potential. One such area is the lower Rogue River in southwestern Oregon. The lower Rogue is endowed with a wealth and variety of recreational raw materials including <b>mountains,</b> <b>beeches,</b> <b>forests,</b> wildlife, the ocean, and the many tributary streams of the Rogue. The region is well situated in respect to the populous areas of the Pacific Coast, and is readily accessible on its north-south axis by Highway 101. The principal attractions are its renowned salmon and steelhead fishing and its equally famous mail boat trips up the Rogue's riffles. The lower reaches of the river are centered in the Gold Beachburn area, which provides the tourists with fishing and lodging facilities. Aside from the local accommodations, there are resorts along the river. The resorts provide lodging and tackle as well as charter boat service complete with experienced guides. The tyro needs nothing but desire. At present (1965) there is only one park in the area with campground facilities. The U. S. Forest Service, however, has plans for the extensive development of several campgrounds along the river within the Siskiyou National Forest. Curry County is also taking an active interest in the recreation potential. The county is attempting to persuade the state to establish a campground on the lower Rogue. County officials are also formulating plans for the construction of parks and waysides. The federal government is contributing to the development through various projects such as the Rogue River Harbor and the proposed reservoirs on the upper river, which will enhance the region's recreation value. The lower Rogue River has the recreation base and now needs only to have its potential developed and maintained. The concluding suggestions are designed to aid in attaining this goal. These include as a priority of the first order an east-west road to connect Gold Beach with the populous Rogue River Valley. Of second significance are the needs for increasing the Rogue's fisheries. Other developments in the future should include the establishment of a weather reporting station, recreational utilization of the public beaches, interstate improvements of Highway 101, expansion and construction of park and picnic facilities, establishment of a permanent Coast Guard Station, increased advertisement, and numerous lesser recommendations, all of which are a part of the enhancement of the recreation potential of Oregon's lower Rogue River area. This area has the ingredients: With planning it should become one of Oregon's as well as the nation's, most outstanding recreation attractions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fire occurs {{relatively}} {{frequently in}} <b>beech</b> (Nothofagus) <b>forest</b> in drought prone eastern {{areas of the}} South Island, New Zealand. Because beech is poorly adapted to fire, and is slow to regenerate, forest is normally replaced by scrub or grassland. Seeding was investigated {{as a means of}} restoring <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> (N. solandri var. cliffortioides) forest after fire destroyed 300 ha of forest at Mt. Thomas, Canterbury, in 1980. A mixture of <b>mountain</b> <b>beech,</b> Leptospermum scoparium and other small tree and shrub species was sown within a year of the fire in the presence and absence of pasture species as a cover crop, and fertiliser. Seeding of <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> and L. scoparium was successful, but other species were of limited success. Competition from pasture species inhibited establishment of all native species. Fertiliser increased L. scoparium plant numbers in the first year but had no other beneficial effect on establishment of native species. Leptospermum scoparium provided a dense shrub cover in plots where the native species were sown in the absence of pasture species, but <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> had begun to overtop the shrub canopy by 20 years after seeding. Browsing by insects or small animals in the first 2 years is suggested as the main cause of mortality in <b>mountain</b> <b>beech.</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>beech</b> seeded at 1. 4 kg/ha resulted in about 1800 saplings/ha at age 20. It is suggested that seeding the wider burn area more than 2 years after the fire would have been unsuccessful because of competition from herbaceous species, especially Agrostis capillaris, which rapidly invaded the burnt area. A strategy is outlined for establishing <b>mountain</b> <b>beech</b> over large areas when limited quantities of seed are available...|$|R
