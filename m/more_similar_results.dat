Usually, the procedure consists of determining the number of free carboxy groups, with phenolphthalein as indicator and with the same solution, obtains the number of esterified carboxy groups by back titration. This technique needs a pre-treatment to dissolve the pectin under study. The pectin was dissolved by wetting with ethanol and {{with the addition of}} distilled water heated at 40  °C. The system was stirred for 2  h. They emphasized that the color turn of the indicator occurs in a relatively wide range of pH so this fact can result in a considerable error in the determination. Their results showed that conductometric titration is the technique that offers <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> to those published in the literature, if compared with the results obtained by potentiometric titration [6]. Two important conclusions can be remarked from this research work. The first one is the benefit of not using an indicator in the conductometric titration technique, so the error of this kind can be disregarded and the second one, which was related to the first one, is the advantages of implementing this technique over the potentiometric because it offers more accurate results.|$|E

During this study, the lagoon received direct input of marine water three times, resulting in remarkable salinity, nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass variations in both temporal and spatial aspects. The phytoplankton biomass presented relatively low values ranging, on average, from 0. 54 mg. L- 1 in the station closest to the sea (station 1) to 1. 34 mg. L- 1 in the station close to a macrophyte bank (station 3). Diatoms and cryptomonads dominated in stations 1 and 2 (located relatively close to station 1, yet receiving the runoff of domestic sewage), and euglenoids, cryptomonads and dinoflagellates at station 3. Stations 1 and 2 usually presented the same dominant species but station 2 presented a higher phytoplankton biomass. On the other hand, station 3 showed <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> concerning phytoplankton biomass with station 2, however the dominant species were usually different.

They also {{exceeded the}} calculated PNEC-values {{by a factor of}} 2.2 in Abiskojaure up to a factor of 9.1 in Älgsjön and St. Envättern. Since the Cu NOEC value reflects the concentration where there should be no negative effect on the algal growth rate, it is notable that the NOEC value was higher than the measured EC 50, i.e. the estimated Cu concentration for 50  % growth reduction. However, since the use of NOEC values in ecotoxicology is strongly questioned by international standardisations bodies [22], the BLM software should use an ECx endpoint instead. BLM v. 0.0. 0.17 overall gave a larger deviation between calculated and measured values than BLM v. 2.2. 3. BLM v. 2.2. 3, which uses a conversion factor to calculate chronic toxicity, produced results for the two Daphnia species within a factor of two.

Furthermore, even though BLM v. 2.2. 3 is an acute model, the approach of using the conversion factor seems to be working, at least for the investigated waters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the nucleus}} tractus solitarii (NTS) of rats, {{blockade}} of extracellular ATP breakdown to adenosine reduces arterial blood pressure (AP) increases that follow {{stimulation of the}} hypothalamic defense area (HDA). The effects of ATP on NTS P 2 receptors, during stimulation of the HDA, are still unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether activation of P 2 receptors in the NTS mediates cardiovascular responses to HDA stimulation. Further investigation was taken to establish if changes in hindlimb vascular conductance (HVC) elicited by electrical stimulation of the HDA, or activation of P 2 receptors in the NTS, are relayed in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM); and if those responses depend on glutamate release by ATP acting on presynaptic terminals. In anesthetized and paralyzed rats, electrical stimulation of the HDA increased AP and HVC. Blockade of P 2 or glutamate receptors in the NTS, with bilat-eral microinjections of suramin (10 mM) or kynurenate (50 mM) reduced only the evoked increase in HVC by 75 % or <b>more.</b> <b>Similar</b> <b>results</b> were obtained with the blockade com-bining both antagonists. Blockade of P 2 and glutamate receptors in the RVLM also reduced the increases in HVC to stimulation of the HDAby up to 75 %. Bilateral microinjections of kynuren-ate in the RVLM abolished changes in AP and HVC to injec-tions of the P 2 receptor agonist α,β-methylene ATP (20 mM) into the NTS. The findings suggest that HDA-NTS-RVLM pathways in control of HVC are mediated by activation of P 2 and glutamate receptors in the brainstem in alerting-defense reactions...|$|E

The speed and low cost of Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) overcomes many of these limitations, {{but it is an}} indirect method relying on calibration models that are typically developed and validated with small sample sets. In this study, we used > 1500 young greenhouse grown trees from a clonally propagated single Populus family, grown at low and high nitrogen, and compared FT-NIR calibration sample sizes of 150, 250, 500 and 750 on calibration and prediction model statistics, and heritability estimates developed with pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry (pyMBMS) wood chemical composition. As calibration sample size increased from 150 to 750, predictive model statistics improved slightly. Overall, stronger calibration and prediction statistics were obtained with lignin, S-lignin, S/G ratio, and m/z 144 (an ion from cellulose), than with C 5 and C 6 carbohydrates, and m/z 114 (an ion from xylan). Although small differences in model statistics were observed between the 250 and 500 sample calibration sets, when predicted values were used for calculating genetic control, the 500 sample set gave substantially <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> to those obtained with the pyMBMS data.

We compare an adaptive mesh refinement code (RAMSES), a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (sphNG), and a volume-discretised meshless code (GIZMO). Using standard refinement criteria, we find that RAMSES produces a disc that is less vertically concentrated and does not reach such high densities as the sphNG or GIZMO runs. The gas surface density in the spiral arms increases at a lower rate for the RAMSES simulations {{compared to the other}} codes. There is also a greater degree of substructure in the sphNG and GIZMO runs and secondary spiral arms are more pronounced. By resolving the Jeans' length with a greater number of grid cells we achieve <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> to the Lagrangian codes used in this study.

40|$|Testing the {{relative}} {{performances of the}} single ring pressure infiltrometer (PI) and simplified falling head (SFH) techniques to determine the field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K fs, at the near point scale may help to better establish the usability of these techniques for interpreting and simulating hydrological processes. A sampling of 10 Sicilian sites showed that the measured K fs was generally higher with the SFH technique than the PI one, with statistically significant differences by a factor varying from 3 to 192, depending on the site. A short experiment with the SFH technique yielded higher K fs values because a longer experiment with the PI probably promoted short-term swelling phenomena reducing macroporosity. Moreover, the PI device likely altered the infiltration surface {{at the beginning of}} the run, particularly in the less stable soils, where soil particle arrangement may be expected to vary upon wetting. This interpretation was supported by a soil structure stability index, SSI, and also by the hydraulic conductivity data obtained with the tension infiltrometer, i. e. with a practically negligible disturbance of the sampled soil surface. In particular, a statistically significant, increasing relationship with SSI and an unsaturated conductivity greater than the saturated one were only detected for the K fs data obtained with the PI. The SFH and PI techniques should be expected to yield <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> in relatively rigid porous media (low percentages of fine particles and structurally stable soils) than in soils that modify appreciably their particle arrangement upon wetting. The simultaneous use of the two techniques may allow to improve K fs determination in soils that change their hydrodynamic behaviour during a runoff producing rainfall event...|$|E

Standardised (z-scored) results for English and mathematics showed an expected relationship with sex, with girls exhibiting an advantage over boys in English (0. 433 SD (95 %CI 0. 395, 0. 470), p< 10 - 10) with <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> (though in the opposite direction) in mathematics (0. 042 SD (95 %CI 0. 004, 0. 080), p = 0. 030).

40|$|Dynamic crop {{models are}} {{frequently}} used in ecology, agronomy and environmental sciences for simulating crop and environmental variables at a discrete time step. They often include {{a large number}} of parameters whose values are uncertain, and it is often impossible to estimate all these parameters accurately. A common practice consists in selecting a subset of parameters by global sensitivity analysis, estimating the selected parameters from data, and setting the others to some nominal values. For a discrete-time model, global sensitivity analyses can be applied sequentially at each simulation date. In the case of dynamic crop models, simulations are usually computed at a daily time step and the sequential implementation of global sensitivity analysis at each simulation date can result in several hundreds of sensitivity indices, with one index per parameter per simulation date. It is not easy to identify the most important parameters based on such {{a large number of}} values. In this paper, an alternative method called multivariate global sensitivity analysis was investigated. More precisely, the purposes of this paper are (i) to compare the sensitivity indices and associated parameter rankings computed by the sequential and the multivariate global sensitivity analyses, (ii) to assess the value of multivariate sensitivity analysis for selecting the model parameters to estimate from data. Sequential and multivariate sensitivity analyses were compared by using two dynamic models: a model simulating wheat biomass named WWDM and a model simulating N 2 O gaseous emission in crop fields named CERES-EGC. N 2 O measurements collected in several experimental plots were used to evaluate how parameter selection based on multivariate sensitivity analysis can improve the CERES-EGC predictions. The results showed that sequential and multivariate sensitivity analyses provide modellers with different types of information for models which exhibit a high variability of sensitivity index values over time. Conversely, when the parameter influence is quite constant over time, the two methods give <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results.</b> The results also showed that the estimation of the parameters with the highest sensitivity indices led to a strong reduction of the prediction errors of the model CERES-EGC...|$|E

40|$|Measurements and {{predictions}} of railway-induced vibrations {{are becoming a}} necessity in today’s society where land scarcity causes buildings to be put close to railway traffic. The short distances mean {{an increased risk of}} the indoor vibration and noise disturbances experienced by residents. In short, the scope of the project is to investigate the transmission loss and vibration level decrease across various junction geometries. The junctions are modelled in both the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM). Resonances are avoided when possible by using semi-infinite building components. A two-dimensional model that included Timoshenko beams was set up by Wijkmark [1] and solved using the variational formulation of the DSM by Finnveden [2]. The model is efficient and user-friendly but there is no easy way to adjust the junction geometry since the depths of the walls and the floor slabs are the same. From that study, the current topic was formulated. The results presented in this paper indicate that both the Euler-Bernoulli DS model and the three-dimensional FE model have good potential in describing the vibration transmission across the different junction geometries. The two modelling types show <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> in the analyses of the bending wave attenuation than in the analyses of the quasilongitudinal wave attenuation. One of the probable causes is that the set length of the Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) is not sufficient at such low frequencies. Larger PMLs require bigger geometries that lead to an increase of the computational time. The other proposed reason is the fact that bending waves are created above the asymmetrical junction when the lower beam is excited by a vertical harmonic force. The flexural displacements are neglected in those cases. The results however, were good enough to be satisfactory. Three junction models were investigated and the attenuation is the highest for both wave types in the case with a beam pair attached to the “middle” of an infinite plate. The attenuation is the second highest across the edge of a semi-infinite plate and the lowest across a junction corner of a semi-infinite plate. As part of the suggested future work, the wave transmission between beam and plate needs to be investigated when Timoshenko beams are included in the DS model. In the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory the cross-section remains perpendicular to the beam axis, which is different to the behaviour of solid elements in FEM...|$|E

40|$|Reservoirs {{in areas}} with a high {{sediment}} yield will without mitigation sooner or later be filled up with sediments, reducing the volume available for regulation for electric generation. Flushing of sediments is a management strategy used in many reservoirs in the world, with varying degree of success. The Angostura reservoir is a shallow reservoir located on an inundated river, making it extra vulnerable to sedimentation. It is estimated a yearly inflow of 1. 5 million tons of sediment. Other reservoirs are located upstream, and the flushing of these leads to large quantities of sediment inflow {{in a short period}} of time. In September every year, the water level in Angostura is partially drawn down to route this sediment through the reservoir. In November, the water level is drawn down completely, and a full sediment flushing is performed. The RESCON model is a spreadsheet program designed to find a technically feasible sediment management strategy that maximizes the economical benefits of the project. Flushing is modeled with a simple algebraic model. SSIIM is a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics program designed for hydraulic engineering. Sediment erosion, transport and sedimentation can be modeled in a complex reservoir geometry using an adaptive grid with a moveable bed. The main objective of this thesis is to test the performance of the RESCON and SSIIM models. The RESCON model was tested on the November flushing to see if it can reproduce the measured volume of flushed sediments. SSIIM was used for simulation of sediment concentration distribution in the reservoir, and to model the September flushing. The results are compared to measured values. The reservoir geometry is based on bathymetry data from September 2011. Inflow series are from logged values at the hydropower plant. Depth-averaged concentration values are used to present the longitudinal concentration distribution, and Hunter Rouse profiles to present the vertical distribution. Using known reservoir values and the recommended coefficients, the RESCON model was not able to get close to the actual volume of flushed sediments. Although the model has given promising results in other cases, the complex reservoir geometry in Angostura sets heavy restrictions on the flushing processes in the reservoir, which an algebraic model of this type cannot reproduce. The steady state simulation was successful in explaining previously unexplained variations in the concentration in the lateral and longitudinal direction of the reservoir. The simulation reproduces the longitudinal and vertical concentration distribution well. A bug in the implementation of the second-order scheme in SSIIM was discovered, which has later been fixed, giving <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> for the first-order and second-order schemes. The time allocated for the flushing simulation was not enough to get satisfactory results.

We thus recover an exponential inequality and the concentration phenomenon for the uniform probability on the cube first obtained by Bobkov and Gotze. Inequalities involving the discrete gradient and {{powers of the}} discrete Laplacian are also considered, for the Lp norm or <b>more</b> general ones. <b>Similar</b> <b>results</b> hold true, replacing functions on the cube by elements of the CAR algebra and considering the annihilation operators and the number operator...|$|R

We show that higher integrability of the boundary datum u* forces minimizers u to be <b>more</b> integrable. A <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> is obtained for obstacle problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} the entropy of a finitely {{generated}} pseudogroup (resp., of a foliation on a compact Riemannian manifold) can be calculated by suitable counting separated pseudo-orbits (resp., pseudoleaves). 0. Introduction. Since several years, pseudo-orbits {{play an important role}} in the theory of classical dynamical systems. In particular, it is shown ([Mi] and [BS]) that pseudo-orbits can be used to calculate the topological entropy of transformations. <b>More</b> recently, the <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> was obtained [Hur] for the inverse-image entropy introduced earlier by Remi Langevin and the second author [LW 1]...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} how well students in introductory science classes (both physics and chemistry) are able to predict which questions they will or {{will not be able}} to answer correctly on an upcoming assessment. An examination of the data at the level of students’ overall scores reveals results consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect, in which low-performing students tend to overestimate their abilities, while high-performing students estimate their abilities <b>more</b> accurately. <b>Similar</b> <b>results</b> have been widely reported in the science education literature. Breaking results out by students’ responses to individual questions, however, reveals that students of all ability levels have difficulty distinguishing questions which they are able to answer correctly from those that they are not able to answer correctly. These results have implications for the future study and reporting of students’ metacognitive abilities...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{geometric}} algorithms for approximating the visibility between two imprecise locations amidst {{a set of}} obstacles, where the imprecise locations are modeled by continuous probability distributions. Our techniques are based on approximating distributions {{by a set of}} regions rather than on approximating by a discrete point sample. In this way we obtain guaranteed error bounds, and the results are <b>more</b> robust than <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> based on discrete point sets. We implemented our techniques and present an experimental evaluation. The experiments show that the actual error of our region-based approximation scheme converges quickly when increasing the complexity of the regions. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Infusions and {{decoction}} of {{chestnut tree}} flowers {{have been used}} for different medical purposes, but their phytochemical profile and antioxidant activity are still mostly unknown. Herein, decoctions and infusions of flowers from the two most appreciated chestnut cultivars (longal and judia) in Trás-os-Montes, Portugal, were prepared and characterized with regard to their content in free sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and hydrolyzable tannins, and their antioxidant activity. Overall, the decoction of the cultivar judia was the sample with both the highest quantity of flavonoids and antioxidant activity. The phenolic compound with the highest abundance in all samples was trigalloyl-HHDP-glucoside, followed by pentagalloyl glucoside. The sample with the highest quantity of total phenolic compounds was judia infusion, closely followed by longal decoction, which also gave the highest quantities of ellagitannins. Regarding sugars and organic acids, the profiles were <b>more</b> <b>similar.</b> These <b>results</b> corroborate ancestral claims of the health benefits of infusions and decoctions of chestnut flowers...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{modeling}} method for highly available systems is proposed. As an input, the model accepts common Reliability Block Diagrams, which {{are widely used}} because of their excellent manageability. However, unlike traditional solution methods for Block Diagrams, the proposed method also supports the attribution of the model with several kinds of inter-component dependencies. Thus, the evaluation of such a model will yield much <b>more</b> realistic <b>results,</b> <b>similar</b> to using state-based models like Markovia...|$|R
