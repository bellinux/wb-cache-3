5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe. Therefore, the study suggested more scientific research is necessary before a conclusion can be made about probiotic supplementation in infant formula, since the research is still quite preliminary.|$|E

Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river.

25|$|While the {{scientific}} study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science, a natural science or a cognitive science, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also {{lies at the heart of}} the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a foreign language usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people my age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E
