25|$|Genghis Khan saw Ögedei as a courteous {{and generous}} character. His {{charisma}} is partially credited for {{his success in}} keeping the Empire on his father's path. Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and to the personal charisma of Ögedei, {{the affairs of the}} Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. Ögedei was an extremely pragmatic man, though he <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> during his reign. He had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Mark Johnson, a {{producer}} {{from all of}} the Narnia movies, admitted that [...] "We <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> with Prince Caspian and I don't want to make them again." [...] He also said Caspian lacked some of the [...] "wonder and magic of Narnia," [...] was [...] "a little bit too rough" [...] for families, and too much of a [...] "boys' action movie." ...|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, {{many members}} of the cast and crew felt that the season was not the show's best. Rainn Wilson said that the season <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> [...] "creatively"; for instance, he argued that the {{chemistry}} between Spader and Helms was [...] "a bit dark" [...] and that the show should have gone for a [...] "brighter and more energized" [...] relationship. Brian Baumgartner felt that the show [...] "stayed status quo , but without a key piece" [...] and [...] "didn't make a firm decision" [...] on the direction it was headed. Ben Silverman, one of the show's producers, said that [...] "it didn't have the sense of purpose and focus" [...] that the next season would have.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2000, National Geographic {{issued a}} press release stating that the fossil could be a composite, and that an {{internal}} investigation had begun. In that same month Bill Allen, National Geographic editor, told Nature that he was [...] "furious" [...] {{to learn that the}} fossil might have been faked. In the March issue, in the forum section, a letter from Dr. Xu Xing pointed out that the tail section probably did not match the upper body. In October 2000 National Geographic published the results of their investigation, in an article written by Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Lewis M. Simons. Simons concluded that the fossil was a composite and that virtually everyone involved in the project had <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes.</b>|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2013, MLB {{suspended}} Braun for {{the remaining}} 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, [...] "I realize now that I have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes.</b> I am {{willing to accept the}} consequences of those actions." [...] ESPN reported that Braun decided to [...] "strike a deal" [...] with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him. Called a [...] "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation. In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Kirke {{began to}} look puzzled. [...] "I must have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake</b> about the house," [...] he said. [...] "Surely there's a lawn cut octagon-shape at Sea-view Cottage, and a white flag-staff {{in the middle of}} the gravel-walk?" ...|$|R

500|$|The Old Testament was {{edited by}} Ernst Grabe in 1707-1720, and New Testament in 1786 by Carl Gottfried Woide, in {{facsimile}} from wooden type, line for line, without intervals between the words, precisely almost as in original. Unfortunately Woide <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes,</b> e.g. in 1 Tim 3:16 he edits ΘΣ , and combats in his prolegomena {{the opinion of}} Wettstein, who maintained that ΟΣ [...] was the original reading, and that the stroke, which in some lights can be seen across part of the Ο, arose from part of a letter visible through the vellum. Part of the Ε {{on the other side}} of the leaf does insert the O. Another errors of Woide were made in the Epistle to Ephesians – the substitution of [...] (4:1) and πραόθητος for πραότητος (4:2).|$|E
500|$|The {{grand jury}} issued its {{report on the}} {{investigation}} in October 2006, and a judge ordered it {{released to the public}} on November 16. The report categorized the Fletcher administration's actions as [...] "a widespread and coordinated plan to violate merit hiring laws." [...] It charged that [...] "This investigation was not about a few people here and there who <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> as Governor Ernie Fletcher had claimed," [...] and lamented that the blanket pardon issued by Fletcher, coupled with Fletcher taking the Fifth, made it [...] "difficult {{to get to the bottom}} of the facts of this case....As a result, [...] in part forced to rely on documentary evidence to piece together the facts of the case." [...] Fletcher opined that the allegations in the report were inconsistent with his settlement with Stumbo, which acknowledged that Fletcher's administration acted [...] "without malice." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said Sue, [...] "that you <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake.</b> Probably Professor Hobkin was a gynæcologist. A scholar {{is a very}} {{different}} sort of man. A scholar is overflowing with humour and invention--perhaps addicted to wine, but what of that?--a delightful companion, generous, subtle, imaginative--as stands to reason. For he spends his life in company with the finest human beings that have ever existed." ...|$|R
6000|$|The eminent Q.C. let {{the paper}} drop from his huge red {{hands in the}} {{intensity}} of his surprise, while his jaw fell in unison at so startling and almost incredible a piece of intelligence. [...] "Nevitt knows all!" [...] he exclaimed, half incredulous. [...] "He means to ruin us! And he told this to Gwendoline! Gone down to Mambury! Oh no, Minnie, impossible! You must have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake.</b> What did she say exactly? Did she mention Mambury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Lord Runton answered, [...] "but {{they were}} all in code. I happen to know that because the {{postmaster}} brought the first one up himself, and explained that he was afraid that he must have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake</b> as the message was incomprehensible. Fielding only laughed, and gave the man a sovereign. The message was absolutely correct, he declared. He told me afterwards that whenever he was speculating he always coded his messages, and it seemed perfectly reasonable." ...|$|R
500|$|The barn's main posts {{are made}} of oak. Each is about [...] square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common {{building}} material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together {{on the ground and}} scratched Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right, they may have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was {{determined}} to move on from the final after scoring an own goal: [...] "Losing cup finals and scoring an own goal is a bad day for myself, but I'll {{look forward to the}} next game now." [...] He also said that Chelsea deserved the victory: [...] "We scored early on and tried to see the clock out because we were 15 minutes away from lifting the cup, but credit to Chelsea they came back and deserved the win." [...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal you finish the game, but we <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I say to the players we must be proud because we played a good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E
500|$|A more {{complete}} specimen of similar animal {{was discovered in}} a quarry in Maidstone, Kent, in 1834 (lower Lower Greensand Formation), which Mantell soon acquired. He was led to identify it as an Iguanodon based on its distinctive teeth. The Maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of Iguanodon, but due to its incompleteness, Mantell <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes,</b> {{the most famous of}} which was the placement of {{what he thought was a}} horn on the nose. The discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb. Still encased in rock, the Maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the Natural History Museum in London. The borough of Maidstone commemorated this find by adding an Iguanodon as a supporter to their coat of arms in 1949. This specimen has become linked with the name I. mantelli, a species named in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in place of I. anglicus, but it actually comes from a different formation than the original I. mantelli/I. anglicus material. The Maidstone specimen, also known as Gideon Mantell's [...] "Mantel-piece", and formally labelled NHMUK 3741 was subsequently excluded from Iguanodon. It is classified as cf. Mantellisaurus by McDonald (2012); as cf. Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis by Norman (2012); and made the holotype of a separate species Mantellodon carpenteri by Paul (2012).|$|E

2500|$|Huis {{said of his}} victory: [...] "It's very {{exciting}} to be here, racing in conjunction with pro drivers {{during one of the}} most renowned tech forward events. And to be the ultimate grand victor with Faraday Future Dragon Racing is thrilling." [...] Second-place finisher Rosenqvist stated that the simulation racing environment was new to all the professional racing drivers but was delighted with his achievement and expressed his hope of competing in future eRaces: [...] "In the end it worked out very well for me and I was up the at front in every session. Luckily, in the final I started from the front row and had a very clean race with a long first stint, without any traffic, and I was able to cruise to the podium in P2." [...] Despite his twelve-second penalty for the overuse of FanBoost, Pahkala was sanguine, feeling that the worlds of simulation and real life racing belong together and reserved praise for the development of motor racing eSport events: [...] "In the end, P3 was more than welcome for me. It’s been a blast! I <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the practice session preparation which cost me pace later on and P3 is more than fair for everyone with what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes.</b> But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it." [...] The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, [...] "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..." [...] followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.|$|E
60|$|We {{changed our}} plans a trifle {{when it came}} to {{building}} the palisade, for we found a rotted cliff near by where we could get all the flat building-stone we needed, and so we constructed a stone wall entirely around the buildings. It was {{in the form of a}} square, with bastions and towers at each corner which would permit an enfilading fire along any side of the fort, and was about one hundred and thirty-five feet square on the outside, with walls three feet thick at the bottom and about a foot and a half wide at the top, and fifteen feet high. It took a long time to build that wall, and we all turned in and helped except von Schoenvorts, who, by the way, had not spoken to me except in the line of official business since our encounter--a condition of armed neutrality which suited me to a T. We have just finished it, the last touches being put on today. I quit about a week ago and commenced working on this chronicle for our strange adventures, which will account for any minor errors in chronology which may have crept in; there was so much material that I may have <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes,</b> but I think they are but minor and few.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{realized}} {{after reading}} the script for the pilot episode that his character {{was not going to}} be around for the entirety of the series.

While filming [...] "Obscura", Johnson was informed that his character would not be returning as a series regular for season two. Initially fearing that he had <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake</b> and that they were going to kill his character off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|R
60|$|It was fortunate, on the whole, for Claudius, {{that he did}} {{not rely}} wholly on the simple drawing off of the water from the lake for the {{amusement}} of the immense assemblage that he had convened, for it was found, when, after the close of the battle, the canal was opened, that the water would not run. The engineers had <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistake</b> in their measurements or their calculations, and had left the bed of the canal in some part of its course too high, so that the water, when the sluices were opened, instead of flowing off into the river to which the canal was intended to conduct it, remained quietly in the lake as before.|$|R

60|$|Well did she {{discharge}} {{the duties}} {{which she had}} undertaken; she kept her father's mind at ease, followed out his views, managed the boys with discretion and gentleness, and made her sisters well-informed and accomplished girls; but, for want of fully understanding the characters of her two next sisters, Emily and Lilias, she <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> with regard to them. The clouds of sorrow, to her so dark and heavy, had been to them but morning mists, and the four years which had changed her from a happy girl into a thoughtful, anxious woman, had brought them to an age which, if {{it is full of}} the follies of childhood, also partakes of the earnestness of youth; an age when deep foundations of enduring confidence may be laid by one who can enter into and direct the deeper flow of mind and feeling which lurks hid beneath the freaks and fancies of the early years of girlhood. But Eleanor had little sympathy for freaks and fancies. She knew the realities of life too well to build airy castles with younger and gayer spirits; her sisters' romance seemed to her dangerous folly, and their lively nonsense levity and frivolity. They were too childish to share in her confidence, and she was too busy and too much preoccupied to have ear or mind for visionary trifles, though to trifles of real life she paid no small degree of attention.|$|E
