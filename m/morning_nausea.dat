5000|$|Couvade syndrome, {{also called}} {{sympathetic}} pregnancy, is a proposed {{condition in which}} a partner experiences {{some of the same}} symptoms and behavior as an expectant mother. These most often include minor weight gain, altered hormone levels, <b>morning</b> <b>nausea,</b> and disturbed sleep patterns. In more extreme cases, symptoms can include labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The labor pain symptom is commonly known as sympathy pain.|$|E
50|$|Even <b>morning</b> sickness, <b>nausea</b> and {{vomiting}} common to most pregnant women {{but no other}} mammals, has a defensive purpose. Morning sickness discourages pregnant women from eating meat and strong-tasting vegetables, which may contain toxins and microorganisms. If ingested, the fetus might be harmed. After around the 18th week, the fetus becomes less vulnerable.|$|R

25|$|The {{symptoms}} and discomforts of pregnancy are those presentations and conditions {{that result from}} pregnancy but do not significantly interfere with {{activities of daily living}} or pose a threat {{to the health of the}} mother or baby. This is in contrast to pregnancy complications. Sometimes a symptom that is considered a discomfort can be considered a complication when it is more severe. For example, <b>nausea</b> (<b>morning</b> sickness) can be a discomfort, but if, in combination with significant vomiting it causes a water-electrolyte imbalance, it is a complication known as hyperemesis gravidarum.|$|R
50|$|SAD {{is a type}} {{of major}} {{depressive}} disorder, and sufferers may exhibit any of the associated symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, thoughts of suicide, loss of interest in activities, withdrawal from social interaction, sleep and appetite problems, difficulty with concentration and decisions, decreased sex drive, a lack of energy, or agitation. Symptoms of winter SAD often include oversleeping or difficulty waking up in the <b>morning,</b> <b>nausea,</b> and a tendency to over eat, often with a craving for carbohydrates, which leads to weight gain. SAD is typically associated with winter depression, but springtime lethargy or other seasonal mood patterns are not uncommon. Although each individual case is different, in contrast to winter SAD, people who experience spring and summer depression {{may be more likely to}} show symptoms such as insomnia, decreased appetite and weight loss, and agitation or anxiety.|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Nausea and {{vomiting}} can pose a significant burden to {{patients in a}} variety of clinical settings. Previous evidence suggests that ginger may be an effective treatment for these symptoms; however, current evidence has been mixed. This article discusses recent clinical trials that have investigated ginger as a treatment for multiple types of nausea and vomiting. In addition, the potential mechanisms of action of ginger will be discussed. Recent findings This article identified nine studies and seven reviews that investigated ginger for <b>morning</b> sickness, postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting, chemotherapy-induced, and antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting. All studies reported that ginger provided a significant reduction in nausea and vomiting; however, the clinical relevance of some studies is less certain. Common limitations within the literature include the lack of standardized extracts, poorly controlled or blinded studies, and limited sample size. In addition, recent evidence has provided further support for 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonism as a mechanism by which ginger may exert its potentially beneficial effect on nausea and vomiting. Summary The results of studies in this article suggest that ginger is a promising treatment for nausea and vomiting {{in a variety of}} clinical settings and possesses a clinically relevant mechanism. However, further studies are required to address the limitations in the current clinical literature before firm recommendations for its use can be made...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Identifying {{marathon}} runners {{at risk of}} neurological deterioration {{at the end of}} {{the race}} (within a large cohort complaining of exhaustion, dehydration, nausea, headache, dizziness, etc.) is challenging. Here we report a case of rehydration-related hyponatraemia with ensuing brain herniation. Case presentation We report the death of runner in his 30 's who collapsed in the recovery area following a marathon. Following rehydration he developed a respiratory arrest in the emergency room. He was found to be hyponatraemic (130 mM). A CT brain scan showed severe hydrocephalus and brain stem herniation. Despite emergency insertion of an extraventricular drain, he was tested for brainstem death the following morning. Funduscopy demonstrated an acute-on-chronic papilledema; CSF spectrophotometry did not reveal any trace of oxyhemoglobin or bilirubin, but ferritin levels were considerably raised (530 ng/mL, upper reference value 12 ng/mL), consistent with a previous bleed. Retrospectively it emerged that the patient had suffered from a thunderclap headache some months earlier. Subsequently he developed <b>morning</b> headaches and <b>nausea.</b> This suggests that he may have suffered from a subarachnoid haemorrhage complicated by secondary hydrocephalus. This would explain why in this case the relatively mild rehydration-related hyponatremia may have caused brain swelling sufficient for herniation. Conclusion Given the frequency of hyponatraemia in marathon runners (serum Na < 135 mM in about 13 %), and the non-specific symptoms, we discuss how a simple screening test such as funduscopy may help to identify those who require urgent neuroimaging. </p...|$|R
30|$|Radiologically, the {{presence}} of hydrocephalus in cases of patients suffering from fourth ventricular tumors is a hallmark dragging attention to patients suffering from space occupying lesion obstructing the cerebrospinal fluid pathways {{at the level of}} the fourth ventricle with a subsequent famous triad of increased intracranial pressure composed of headache especially at the <b>morning,</b> <b>nausea</b> and vomiting, and blurring of vision. In case of ependymoma, the incidence of hydrocephalus was 100 %, which is compatible with 100 % in the work of Amirian and his colleagues [11]. In this study, this picture was present in 91.6 % of patients with medulloblastoma (11 patients out of 12). According to the work of Anthony and his colleagues, hydrocephalus occurs in a percentage of 94 % in cases on medulloblastoma [12].|$|E
40|$|A 33 -YEAR-OLD {{merchant}} marine sea-man {{was seen in}} a private diagnostic clinic. He gave a history of having had the follow-ing symptoms for 6 to 8 weeks: abdominal distention, <b>morning</b> <b>nausea,</b> movement felt in the abdomen, and increased appetite af-ter the onset of abdominal swelling. T h e physician, who examined him carefully, thought there was possibly some fluid in the abdomen. He noted the rather marked abdominal distention, and the patient re-ported that his waist had increased from 32 to 37 inches. T h e physician felt that these symptoms were suggestive of liver disease and questioned the patient about his drink-ing habits. T h e patient gave a history of practically no intake of alcohol. Acute in-fectious hepatitis was considered. Many laboratory procedures were done, includ-ing urine, hematologic, and blood chemis-try studies. All were within normal limits. Radiographic studies, including a flat film of the abdomen, GI series, and barium enema were negative. Physical examination revealed a well-de-veloped white male who appeared his stated age.

40|$|Intermittent fasting (IF) is a {{recently}} popularized meal timing strategy whereby individuals abstain continuously from any energy intake for 16 to 20 hours each day, subsequently condensing energy intake into {{a short period}} spanning 4 to 8 hours. We aimed to test the effects of intermittent fasting in 10 individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in conjunction with recommendations to consume a high protein diet in a 6 to 8 week withdrawal study. This study consisted of three phases: baseline, intervention, and follow-up. During the 2 -week baseline and intervention phases participants consumed meals at regular times. Biochemical, anthropometric, and physical activity measurements were taken {{at the end of}} each phase. Participants reported morning, afternoon and evening self-monitored blood glucose and fasting duration on a daily basis, in addition to completing a remote food photography diary three times within each study phase. Despite the short duration of the intervention phase, intermittent fasting led to significant decreases in weight, BMI, morning SMBG, and overall reductions in waist circumference, C-reactive protein, energy intake, carbohydrate intake, and fat intake. There were significant variations between participants in response to intermittent fasting in respect to changes in lipids and insulin sensitivity, which could not be explained by baseline biochemical or anthropometric measures, fasting duration, energy intake, or physical activity. Upon cessation of intermittent fasting, biochemical changes regressed towards baseline values during the follow-up period. Intermittent fasting was well tolerated by most participants, and no severe adverse events were noted. <b>Morning</b> <b>nausea</b> was the most common complaint, which abruptly ceased when medication timing was changed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elicit the pathogenetic response of Hygrophila spinosa in homoeopathic potencies on healthy human volunteers. Methodology: The drug Hygrophila spinosa was proved by the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) through randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled method. The proving was conducted at three centres viz. Central Research Institute (H), [CRI (H) ] Noida, Drug Proving Unit [DPU], Bhubaneswar and Regional Research Institute (H) [RRI (H) ], Kolkata. The drug was proved in two potencies (6 C and 30 C) on 48 apparently healthy volunteers who were selected after conducting pre-trial medical examinations by the medical specialists and routine laboratory investigations. 32 of them where kept on interventional drug trial and remaining took placebo. At CRI (H), NOIDA, 56 dose schedule (i. e. 56 doses of drug/placebo were consumed in each batch) was followed while at DPU, Bhubaneswar and at RRI (H), Kolkata, 12 dose schedule (i. e. 12 doses of drug/placebo were to be consumed in each batch) was followed. The symptoms generated during the trial period were noted by the volunteers and elaborated by the Proving Masters which were compiled at Homoeopathic Drug Proving-cum-Data Processing cell of CCRH headquarters after decoding. Results: Out of 32 provers who were on interventional drug trial, only 14 manifested symptoms. The drug was able to produce symptoms in both the potencies. 92 symptoms appeared during the drug trial from various locations. Conclusion: The drug pathogenesis evolved indicates its therapeutic use for urticaria, frontal sinusitis, conjunctivitis, stomatitis, gastroenteritis, <b>nausea</b> (<b>morning</b> sickness), intermittent fever etc...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} and tolerability of a chronobiotic (melatonin) with a hypnotic (zolpidem) and the combination of both substances to alleviate jet lag symptoms associated with eastward travel. METHODS This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is based on 137 volunteers flying from Switzerland to the American continent and back (6 - 9 time zones). The participants either received melatonin 5 mg (n = 35), zolpidem 10 mg (n = 34), a combination thereof (n = 29) or placebo (n = 39) on the eastbound flight back to Switzerland and once daily at bedtime on 4 consecutive days after the flight. The test battery included daily sleep logs, symptoms questionnaires, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Also, on the last treatment day, Visual Analog Scales (VAS) were completed to assess overall jet lag ratings and treatment effectiveness. Baseline data were collected on 4 consecutive days 2 wk after the flight. During post-flight treatment and baseline, motor activity was assessed in a subgroup of 49 subjects using wrist-worn ambulatory monitors. RESULTS The self-rated sleep quality was significantly improved by zolpidem, especially during the night flight. Subjects taking zolpidem reported significantly less jet lag and zolpidem was rated as the most effective jet lag medication. However, zolpidem and the combination melatonin/zolpidem were less well tolerated than melatonin alone; adverse event reports included nausea, vomiting, amnesia and somnambulia to the point of incapacitation. Confusion, <b>morning</b> sleepiness and <b>nausea</b> were highest in the combination group. CONCLUSIONS All active treatments led to a decrease of jet lag severity with zolpidem being the most effective treatment, particularly in facilitating sleep on night flights. Potential individual adverse reactions to this hypnotic have to be considered...|$|R
