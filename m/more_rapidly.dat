5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E

The {{operculum}} is multispiral as {{in a typical}} Trochus and with <b>more,</b> less <b>rapidly</b> expanding whorls compared with Euchelus. Species in this genus has typically two teeth, joined by a U-shaped notch, where the columella and the basal lips join.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid desensitization of glutamate receptors in chicken spinal cord and rat hippocampal neurons. Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply glutamate and other agonists including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to state reptiles, state birds have been <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> adopted, {{with the first}} state designating one in 1927 and the fiftieth in 1973. As of January 2011, other types of animals more popular for state symbolization were mammals (46), fish (45), and insects (42). Animal symbols less popular than reptiles were butterflies (17), amphibians (17), dogs (11), dinosaurs (5), bats (3), and crustaceans (3).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
50|$|Most early potentiostats could {{function}} independently, providing {{data output}} through a physical data trace. Modern potentiostats {{are designed to}} interface with a personal computer and operate through a dedicated software package. The automated software allows the user rapidly to shift between experiments and experimental conditions. The computer allows data to be stored and analyzed <b>more</b> effectively, <b>rapidly,</b> and accurately than historic methods.|$|R
30|$|In {{patients}} with <b>more</b> extensive, <b>rapidly</b> expanding, or bilobar disease, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has gained popularity. ALPPS is as two-staged surgical procedure that may offer rapid and major FLR hypertrophy and a decreased risk of post-operative liver failure compared to PVE followed by hepatectomy [22]; however, {{it is also}} associated with greater peri-operative morbidity and mortality [23].|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools <b>more</b> <b>rapidly,</b> and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|On August24, {{satellite}} imagery indicated a hurricane with a defined eye was located over the central Pacific Ocean. It slowly weakened {{as it moved}} over lukewarm waters, and deteriorated <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> after wind shear increased. By August28, the system consisted of a circulation with only weak associated convection. It weakened to a tropical depression on August30, although it remained a tropical cyclone until September2. At {{that time it was}} last observed about 200mi (320km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E
5000|$|AMO (Archery Manufacturers {{and merchants}} Organization) {{standard}} draw length is {{the distance from}} the string at full draw to the lowest point on the grip plus 1.75 inches / 4.45 cm. Because the draw force may increase <b>more</b> or less <b>rapidly,</b> and again drop off <b>more</b> or less <b>rapidly</b> when approaching peak draw, bows of the same peak draw force can store different amounts of energy. Norbert Mullaney has defined the ratio of stored energy to peak draw force (S.E./P.D.F.). This is usually around one foot-pound per pound / [...]3048 joules per meter (but can reach 1.4 ft·lbf/lbf / [...]42672 J/m).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{asymptotic}} scaling {{behavior of}} the mixing region induced by a random velocity field is determined by applying Corrsin′s hypothesis in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian pictures. Both pictures lead to the same results for the asymptotic scaling exponent of the mixing region.

5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} {{a certain period of}} time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E
5|$|Several {{million years}} ago, {{a species of}} small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. The {{subsequent}} advent of human life, {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E

5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen <b>more</b> <b>rapidly.</b> The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than weaving.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period.

5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased <b>more</b> <b>rapidly</b> than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
