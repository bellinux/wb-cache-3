40|$|The {{tendency}} for <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> to consistently choose media outlets that provide little "useful" information cannot be explained within a purely rational {{model of information}} consumption. Loss aversion is a well documented aspect of human behavior. Economists have theories of rational information consumption and investment that do {{not account for the}} commonly observed media choices of typical <b>media</b> <b>consumers.</b> By integrating loss-aversion into the model of informational choices, we are able to explain many of the commonly observed patterns in media consumption.

Additionally, <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> tend to prefer outlets that confirm pre-existing biases the consumer holds.

" Media is becoming increasingly central to our collective culture as a society; therefore, it is vital that <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> possess the skills to critically examine it as a source of potential stereotypes and misconceptions. According to Kellner and Share (2007), "Critical media literacy involves cultivating skills in analysing media codes and conventions, abilities to criticize stereotypes, dominant values, and ideologies, and competencies to interpret the multiple meanings and messages generated by media texts (p. 372). " Critical media literacy skills allow <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> to see how they have been, often unknowingly, influenced by covert messages found in various forms of media. Media, as with any form of discourse, represents social actors {{in a variety of ways}} (van Leeuwen, 2008).

This proposed organization could initiate media education in the formal and non-formal modes.

Non-formal education may be conducted through <b>media</b> <b>consumer</b> sponsored awareness campaigns. This organization could also conduct its own audience related studies and policy research. It could establish a nationwide89 network involving the church, academic communities, grassroots organizations and cause-oriented groups.
