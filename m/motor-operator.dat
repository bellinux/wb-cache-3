40|$|Researchers at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory {{recently}} conducted tests {{investigating the}} operating {{efficiency of the}} power train (gearbox) in motor-operators typically used in nuclear power plants to power motor-operated valves. Actual efficiency ratios were determined from in-line measurements of electric motor torque (input to the operator gearbox) and valve stem torque (output from the gearbox) while the operators were subjected to gradually increasing loads until the electric motor stalled. The testing included parametric studies under reduced voltage and elevated temperature conditions. As part of {{the analysis of the}} results, we compared efficiency values determined from testing to the values published by the operator manufacturer and typically used by the industry in calculations for estimating <b>motor-operator</b> capabilities. The operators we tested under load ran at efficiencies lower than the running efficiency (typically 50 %) published by the operator manufacturer...|$|E
