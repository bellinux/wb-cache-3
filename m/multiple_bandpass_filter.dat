The receiver consists of many narrow bandpass filters which extract energy either from transmitted UWB signal, interfering channels or noise. Transmitted UWB data can be eliminated by statistical correlation of <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> outputs. Super-regenerative oscillators, tuned within UWB spectrum, are designed as bandpass filters. Summers and comparators perform statistical correlation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of OH {{lines in the}} near-infrared spectrum {{of the night sky}} currently limits sensitivities out to 2. 2 m. Attempts to rectify this situation have so far only concentrated on elaborate grating spectrographs, such as those described by Iwamuro et al. (1994) and Content and Angel (1994). This is because appreciable gains using filter-based solutions have so far proven to be elusive (Herbst 1994). An alternative solution, described in this paper, explores the use of a <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> (MBF) to selectively remove those wavelengths at which the brightest OH lines occur. A numerical evaluation of MBFs as used in the J and H bands is presented, the results from which demonstrate that significant improvements in signal-to-noise are only possible from such a filter (and indeed, any method of OH line blocking), if more than the brightest 50 percent of the line population is removed. We show here that relative to broadband J and H, gains in signal-to-noise greater than unity are difficult to achieve for a continuum source. Over narrower bandpasses, gains of around 1. 8 (J-band) and 1. 5 times (H-band) are possible for the same continuum source and can be 2 to 6 times for a source with line emission. We conclude that the ordinary rectangular wave profile of an MBF is suited to blocking over narrow and intermediate bandwidth filters, as might be used for imaging of emission-line sources or searches for such objects in wide-field surveys. Significant gains in continuum imaging will require more complex filter technologies, which are still in their infancy.

40|$|A pair of {{conjugated}} <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> (CMBF) {{can be used}} {{to create}} spatially separated pupils in a traditional lens and imaging sensor system allowing for the passive capture of stereo video. This method is especially useful for surgical endoscopy where smaller cameras are needed to provide ample room for manipulating tools while also granting improved visualizations of scene depth. The significant issue in this process is that, due to the complimentary nature of the filters, the colors seen through each filter do not match each other, and also differ from colors as seen under a white illumination source. A color correction model was implemented that included optimized filter selection, such that the degree of necessary post-processing correction was minimized, and a chromatic adaptation transformation that attempted to fix the imaged colors tristimulus indices based on the principle of color constancy. Due to fabrication constraints, only dual <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> were feasible. The theoretical average color error after correction between these filters was still above the fusion limit meaning that rivalry conditions are possible during viewing. This error can be minimized further by designing the filters for a subset of colors corresponding to specific working environments...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates a {{computational}} model that combines a frontend {{based on an}} auditory model with an exemplar-based sparse coding procedure for estimating the posterior probabilities of sub-word units when processing noisified speech. Envelope modulation spectrogram (EMS) features are extracted using an auditory model which decomposes the envelopes of the outputs of a bank of gammatone filters into one lowpass and <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> components. Through a systematic analysis of {{the configuration of the}} modulation filterbank, we investigate how and why different configurations affect the posterior probabilities of sub-word units by measuring the recognition accuracy on a semantics-free speech recognition task. Our main finding is that representing speech signal dynamics by means of <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> typically improves recognition accuracy. This effect is particularly noticeable in very noisy conditions. In addition we find that to have maximum noise robustness, the <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> should focus on low modulation frequencies. This reenforces our intuition that noise robustness can be increased by exploiting redundancy in those frequency channels which have long enough integration time not to suffer from envelope modulations that are solely due to noise. The ASR system we design based on these findings behaves more similar to human recognition of noisified digit strings than conventional ASR systems. Thanks to the relation between the modulation filterbank and procedures for computing dynamic acoustic features in conventional ASR systems, the finding can be used for improving the frontends in those systems...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{recursive}} digital filters satisfying both arbitrary {{loss and}} delay constraints is a classical problem. There is no known general analytical solution that can yield coefficient values. Many techniques {{have been proposed}} that offer various advantages, {{and some of these}} are reviewed in the paper. If, in addition, the particular application requires a high sampling rate, as in, for example, video and sonar systems, then {{it is important that the}} structure is efficient in the sense of a minimum number of arithmetic operations for a given order.

40|$|A {{strategy}} has been developed {{for the removal of}} motion artifact and noise in calcium-dependent fluorescence transients from the perfused mouse heart using frequency filtering. An analytical model indicates that the spectral removal of motion artifacts is independent of the phase shift of the motion waveform in the frequency domain, and thus to the time shift (or delay) of motion in the time domain. This is based on the “shift theorem ” of Fourier analysis, which avoids erroneous correction of motion artifact when using the motion signal obtained using reflectance from the heart. Several major steps are adopted to implement this model for elimination of motion as well as detection noise from the fluorescence transient signals from the calcium-sensitive probe Rhod- 2. These include (1) extracting the fluorescence calcium transient signal from the raw data by using power spectrum density (PSD) in the frequency domain by subtracting the motion recorded using the reflectance of excitation light, (2) digitally filtering out the random noise using <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> centralized at harmonic frequencies of the transients, and (3) extracting high frequency noise with a Gaussian Kernel filter method. The processed signal of transients acquired with excessive motion artifact is comparable to transients acquired with minimal motion obtained by immobilizing the heart against the detection window, demonstrating the usefulness of this technique.

5000|$|From the {{introduction}} of voice encryption to today, encryption techniques have evolved drastically. Digital technology has effectively replaced old analog methods of voice encryption and by using complex algorithms, voice encryption {{has become much more}} secure and efficient. One relatively modern voice encryption method is Sub-band coding. With Sub-band Coding, the voice signal is split into multiple frequency bands, using <b>multiple</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> that cover specific frequency ranges of interest. The output signals from the <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> are then lowpass translated to reduce the bandwidth, which reduces the sampling rate. The lowpass signals are then quantized and encoded using special techniques like, Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). After the encoding stage, the signals are multiplexed and sent out along the communication network. When the signal reaches the receiver, the inverse operations are applied to the signal to get it back to its original state. A speech scrambling system was developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s by Subhash Kak and Nikil Jayant. In this system permutation matrices were used to scramble coded representations (such as Pulse Code Modulation and variants) of the speech data. Motorola developed a voice encryption system called Digital Voice Protection (DVP) as part of their first generation of voice encryption techniques. DVP uses a self-synchronizing encryption technique known as cipher feedback (CFB). The basic DVP algorithm is capable of 2.36 x 1021 different [...] "keys" [...] based on a key length of 32 bits." [...] The extremely high number of possible keys associated with the early DVP algorithm, makes the algorithm very robust and gives a high level of security. As with other symmetric keyed encryption systems, the encryption key is required to decrypt the signal with a special decryption algorithm.|$|R
