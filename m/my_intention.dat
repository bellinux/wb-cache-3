5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it was not}} <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to {{interrupt}} my achievement (the OSM), but that it continue under {{the responsibility of the}} Board of the Symphony and the competent and able technicians that they would recruit, I had no other choice but to remain as director of the orchestra, with the greatest and best desire that the new artistic director that we selected to formally work beside me, Jos√© Pablo Moncayo, would arrive to take full responsibility of the situation.|$|E
25|$|From the minuteness {{with which}} I have traced Waverley's pursuits, and the bias which they unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the {{following}} tale, an imitation of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. <b>My</b> <b>intention</b> is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.|$|E

25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E

FIA president Max Mosley published a letter dated from 19 October to Ron Dennis which accused him of damaging the image of Formula One with his recent stream of comments over the issues. Mosley also defended Race Director Charlie Whiting's announcement that marshals could use racing flags to caution drivers over unsportsmanlike behaviour. Dennis responded by apologising for his comments, saying {{that he did not}} intend to bring Formula One into disrepute and cause disrespect to Causo.

500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Final Fantasy VIII (1999), {{unlike that of}} VI and VII, did not include {{character}} themes, as Uematsu felt {{they would not be}} effective. In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to put various types of music into one game". Although the idea had not been used in the previous game, he thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of VIII, and composed [...] "Eyes on Me", performed by Faye Wong. The song was released as a single, while Square produced soundtrack, orchestral, and piano albums for the game's music.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on the incident, while also adding that since August 2016, PewDiePie has included anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery in nine separate videos. The publication reported he removed three of the videos, including the January 2017 Fiverr one. In a 12 February Tumblr post, PewDiePie expressed: [...] "I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes, [...] I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary," [...] and conceded, [...] "though this was not <b>my</b> <b>intention,</b> I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive." [...] In his post, he also reiterated he does not support anti-Semitic groups. PewDiePie's motivation for his Tumblr post was partially driven {{by the fact that}} neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and publications, such as The Daily Stormer, were referencing and praising PewDiePie for his jokes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales.

[...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never <b>my</b> <b>intention.</b> I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly.

500|$|Nobuo Uematsu's usual {{influences}} include Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon and Garfunkel, and Elton John. In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not {{prefer to use}} multiple sources to find MIDI instruments‚Äî"I could be {{coming up with a}} great melody in the very moment"‚Äîinstead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire‚Äî"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to put various types of music into one game".|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 1877, Linderman {{requested}} Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint James Pollock to [...] "instruct Mr. Morgan {{to prepare}} without delay, dies for a silver dollar, the designs, inscriptions, and arrangement thereof {{to be the}} same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered '2' substituting the words 'one dollar' in place of 'half dollar'". Linderman also ordered Pollock to [...] "instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same." [...] Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, [...] "I have now to state for your information, that it is <b>my</b> <b>intention,</b> in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like‚Äîa battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E
500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I {{think it will be a}} shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire‚Äî"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} later added as a video {{interlude}} on The MDNA Tour in 2012, {{as a tribute}} to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan S√∂derberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Le Pen was infuriated by the video, and threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as Bastille Day, the French National Day. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for [...] "public insult" [...] would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying [...] "I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not <b>my</b> <b>intention</b> to make enemies." [...] She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about [...] "intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'" [...] During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by an interrogation mark.|$|E
