50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread,</b> the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads.</b> The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads,</b> and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of furniture corner joints is often {{carried out by}} assembling double thread (“Trio”) nuts and metal corners. Such connections are particularly suitable for disassemble bal structures and these connections are also used for savings in transport when all the structural elements are transported in boxes and furniture is prepared for in site assembly. The assembly process consists of fastening the binding metal corners to wooden elements with the <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> <b>screws.</b> To achieve the optimal quality of these joints, the production process must {{comply with the requirements}} of various products including the loading applications and strength of individual wood species. This paper examines the fundamental factors affecting the quality of such joints. Special attention was paid to the process of screwing and loading capacity of double thread nuts in three different types of wood. Optimization of the technological process was set as the ultimate goal aimed at achieving a high level of product quality. Tests have been conducted on fi r, beech and oak wood to determine optimal bore diameters and nut screwing parameters relative to the screwing resistance, extraction force and the time interval required for nut screwing...|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{principles}} of the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25 mm {{in the case of}} M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. [...] "M8×1" [...] if the <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).|$|R
50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form {{is similar}} to the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. Although <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are generally more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads, the Acme thread is very common worldwide, and may be more widely used than the trapezoidal <b>metric</b> <b>thread.</b> This is not surprising, as manufacturers today are usually capable of making whichever <b>threads</b> (<b>metric</b> or imperial) are best for any given application (based on customer expectations or tooling availability). It may be that the tooling for Acme threads has been so dominant (compared to trapezoidal metric) that customers tend to want Acme <b>threads</b> for power <b>screws</b> regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R
40|$|In general, most bolt {{sizes are}} {{available}} in coarse and fine thread optiones. For example, ISO metric coarse and fine pitch series standard – ISO 724 : 1993 “General purpose <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> – Basic dimensiones ” specify the dimensiones for <b>metric</b> <b>threads.</b> Which type of thread is best for a particular application is a common question. In order to give some answers to that questione this paper deals with finite element analysis of generic bolted joint in different load conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The design {{principles}} of ISO general-purpose <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> ("M" [...] series threads) are defined in international standard ISO 68-1. Each thread {{is characterized by}} its major diameter, D (Dmaj in the diagram), and its pitch, P. ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In {{the plane of the}} thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The thread depth is 0.614 × pitch. The outermost [...] and the innermost [...] of the height H of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.|$|R

The closest ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> equivalent, which is preferred for military use, is an M5 thread (5 mm major thread diameter) and a socket head button which uses a 3 mm hex key.|$|R
50|$|Part 1 {{defines the}} {{mechanical}} properties of bolts, screws, and studs. It specifically applies to fasteners {{that have an}} ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> as defined in ISO 68-1. The properties are defined for M1.6-39 with coarse threads and M8-39 with fine threads. The diameter and pitch combinations must adhere to ISO 261 and ISO 262 and the thread tolerances must adhere to ISO 965 parts 1, 2, and 4.|$|R
50|$|The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) {{defines a}} {{standard}} thread form and series—along with allowances, tolerances, and designations—for <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> {{commonly used in}} the United States and Canada. It is the main standard for bolts, nuts, and {{a wide variety of}} other threaded fasteners used in these countries. It has the same 60° profile as the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread,</b> but the characteristic dimensions of each UTS thread (outer diameter and pitch) were chosen as an inch fraction rather than a millimeter value. The UTS is currently controlled by ASME/ANSI in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Computer case screws are the {{hardware}} used to secure {{parts of a}} PC to the case. Although there are numerous manufacturers of computer cases, they have generally used three thread sizes. The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) originates from the United States while the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> is standardized worldwide. In turn, these thread standards define preferred size combinations {{that are based on}} generic units—some on the inch and others on the millimeter.|$|R
50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>thread,</b> where <b>screws</b> must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R
50|$|Bolts {{have been}} defined as headed {{fasteners}} having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that {{do not meet the}} above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.|$|R
50|$|Its {{predecessor}} organization, the Österreichischer Normenausschuss für Industrie und Gewerbe (Austrian Standards Committee for Industry and Trade), {{was founded}} in the First Republic of Austria on 23 September 1920, with 13 committees developing technical standards primarily for mechanical and electrical engineering. The first standard was published in 1921 on <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads.</b> In 1932, the committee's name was shortened to the Österreichischer Normenausschuss (Austrian Standards Committee). With the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, it became a branch office of the German Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standards organization, but resumed operations {{in its own right}} after World War II, and was a founding ISO member in 1946.|$|R
5000|$|The term fine {{adjustment}} screw typically refers to <b>screws</b> with <b>threads</b> from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra {{fine adjustment}} screw {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard <b>threads,</b> both ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. [...] Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>metric</b> ISO <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> is {{designated}} by the letter M followed by {{the value of the}} nominal diameter D (Dmaj in the diagram above) and the pitch P, both expressed in millimetres and separated by the multiplication sign, × (e.g., M8×1.25). If the pitch is the normally used [...] "coarse" [...] pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). Tolerance classes defined in ISO 965-1 can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500- 6g in external threads). If, for instance, only M20 is given then it is coarse pitch thread.|$|R
50|$|The Pelides was {{the first}} aero engine of Alvis design; the company had {{previously}} only built the French Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major under license. With the two companies working closely together the 14 cylinder radial layout of this engine retained metric dimensions but substituted <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> with British fasteners such as BSF and Whitworth. Material specifications were different as were the detail design of internal parts such as the crankpin. The Pelides passed a 50-hour Air Ministry type test in 1937 where it produced 1,065 hp (794 kW) but no aircraft application was found and only 15 engines were built. The onset of the Second World War caused the abandonment of any further development of the Pelides and its related designs.|$|R
