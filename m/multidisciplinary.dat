5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} treatment {{attempts to}} manage distressing symptoms {{and to teach}} age-appropriate social, communication and vocational skills that are not naturally acquired during development, with intervention tailored {{to the needs of}} the individual based on <b>multidisciplinary</b> assessment. Although progress has been made, data supporting the efficacy of particular interventions are limited.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a <b>multidisciplinary</b> approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. <b>Multidisciplinary</b> rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{radiotherapy}} {{are likely to be}} offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should {{be in the hands of}} a <b>multidisciplinary</b> team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.|$|E
5|$|Having {{experienced}} a stroke, {{a person may}} be admitted to a stroke unit, and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes, including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs. A <b>multidisciplinary</b> team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists plays {{a large role in}} supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, the Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health (LWBIWH) {{was founded}} at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. This {{institute}} aims to integrate research, education and community outreach in a <b>multidisciplinary</b> approach to women's health and has begun efforts {{to establish a}} multi-campus women's health institute in Amarillo, El Paso, Lubbock and the Permian Basin.|$|E
5|$|In the {{neighboring}} city of Paulínia, the university operates a <b>multidisciplinary</b> research center focused on biosciences, acquired in 1986 from Monsanto and {{integrated into the}} university as CPQBA. As part of the acquisition, Unicamp gained access and continued research into subjects previously explored at the center, specially agricultural sciences. Research is usually funded by external parties, such as companies and other universities.|$|E
5|$|The High-Performance Materials Institute (HPMI) is a <b>multidisciplinary</b> {{research}} institute at Florida State University. Its {{mission is to}} strive to recruit, develop and retain top quality faculty and staff who will develop HPMI into a leader of excellence for research and education {{in the field of}} advanced materials. Currently, HPMI is involved in four primary technology areas: High-Performance Composite and Nanomaterials, Structural Health Monitoring, Multifunctional Nanomaterials Advanced Manufacturing and Process Modeling.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a <b>multidisciplinary,</b> team. <b>Multidisciplinary</b> teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

The Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) is a science and business incubator, run by the Georgia Institute of Technology, and is also headquartered in Technology Square's Centergy One complex.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's work is {{normally}} classed as modernista, and {{it belongs to}} this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the <b>multidisciplinary</b> character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaudí adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character {{in the history of}} architecture.|$|E
5|$|The Center for Advanced Power Systems is a <b>multidisciplinary</b> {{research}} center organized to perform basic and applied research {{to advance the}} field of power systems technology. CAPS' emphasis is on application to electric utility, defense, and transportation, as well as, developing an education program to train {{the next generation of}} power systems engineers. The research focuses on electric power systems modeling and simulation, power electronics and machines, control systems, thermal management, cyber-security for power systems, high temperature superconductor characterization and electrical insulation research.|$|E
