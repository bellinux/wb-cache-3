500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment <b>Media</b> <b>Team</b> is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E
500|$|Sonny Takhar, {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. [...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans." [...] Their management employs a social <b>media</b> <b>team</b> and the members all tweet themselves, [...] "which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans," [...] according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian. One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E

2500|$|In June 1999, Peter Donolo, Chrétien's {{well liked}} {{communications}} director, retired {{to be replaced}} with Françoise Ducros. Donolo {{was not part of}} Chrétien's inner circle, which comprised Eddie Goldenberg, Jean Pelletier and his wife Aline, but he often exercised a certain stabilizing influence on Chrétien, and was able to maintain good relations with the Martin camp. Donolo did not approve of some of Chrétien's other advisors like Warren Kinsella, whom Donolo accused of being overtly aggressive and of seeing enemies everywhere. Kinsella for his part saw Martin and his followers as almost much an enemy as the opposition parties, and favored working against as opposed to working with the Martin fraction. Reflecting the changed <b>media</b> <b>team</b> of Ducros and Kinsella, after a minor cabinet reshuffle in the summer of 1999, a story was leaked from the PMO that the reshuffle was a [...] "shot across the bow" [...] that was intended to send the message that Chrétien would be seeking a third term, a message that Donolo felt was unwise as it was bound to provoke a response from the Martin camp.|$|E

[...] After a 64-minute delay, the game was completed, however the next scheduled game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. [...] The remainder of the tournament games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, with spectators restricted to team and conference personnel, <b>media,</b> <b>team</b> bands, and families of players only due to the much smaller size of the alternate venue.
