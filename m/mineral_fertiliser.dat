Biosolid rates from 2 to 10 t/ha were applied in 1993. Shoot dry matter production {{at different stages of}} plant development (9 and 15 weeks after sowing) and grain production of Triticum durum and Hordeum vulgare, as well as nutrient concentration in shoots and grain, were taken as indicators for comparing nutrient availability of the 2 sources. A 2 -t biosolid application was found to enhance dry-matter production and yield to the same extent as a <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application of 20 kg N/ha, 20 kg P/ha, and 1. 8 – 2. 8 kg Zn/ha. In some crop rotations and on sites with a high yield potential, additional nitrogen with 2 t biosolids/ha would be necessary to achieve such yields.

We studied the impact of the liquid AD digestate on the decomposer community in two different soils, seeded with two different common grassland crops; a mixture of either grass or grass/clover in a greenhouse experiment. We studied bacterial (leucine incorporation into bacteria) and fungal (acetate incorporation into ergosterol) growth responses to AD cattle slurry digestate, undigested cattle slurry, <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (NPK and N) added at a rate equivalent to 150 kg N ha(- 1), and a no-fertiliser control treatment. Differences in fungal and bacterial growth were evident between the soil and sward types.

UNIFA has calculated nutrient balances in 21 regions of France to show the trend in the phosphorus and potassium balance since 1988 / 1989. The nutrient balance has been calculated from {{the difference between the}} total input to soils and the total nutrient removal in crops and grass, calculated according to the annual statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture. The difference between the total input and output has reduced considerably since 1988 in all regions. This is the logical result of reduced nutrient inputs during this period. Although the recycling of urban and industrial bio waste and the importation of organic fertilisers has increased since 2005, this does not compensate for the decrease in both <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and of animal excreta, due to reduced numbers of livestock.

40|$|Keywords: Innovation system, Soil {{fertility}} management, Land reform, Participatory technology development, Social change, Agroforestry, Land access rights, Fallow, Agricultural intensification, Africa   On the Adja plateau (West Benin), multiple {{actors are}} involved in an intercropping system with oil palm and food crops. This system {{is known as the}} oil palm-based cropping system (OPBCS). It contains two stages: a stage of small oil palms underneath which food crops are grown and a fallow stage with mature oil palm. Landowners grow oil palm mainly for the artisanal production of palm wine and sodabi, rather than for palm oil, for which the region is unsuitable for climatological reasons. The OPBCS has to be analysed not only from a technical and ecological perspective, but also from an institutional one. In the OPBCS there are competing claims between landowners and tenants for land use. Tenants access land under specific customary rules, grow food crops beneath oil palm and extend the cropping period by severely pruning palms because their right to grow food crops terminates when the palms reach a height of 2 m. Landowners claim that extended cropping reduces soil fertility and that long-duration oil palm fallows are necessary for soil fertility regeneration. Tenants state that long-duration fallow maintains land scarcity. In an attempt to remedy the competing claims, a land titling programme was implemented in some villages on the Adja plateau. I analysed the system with a political ecology lens. I demonstrated the implications of the multiple institutions for land access and ownership, and therefore for the competing claims. Land titling initially created land insecurity for tenants, as they were thrown off the land by owners who wanted to demonstrate ownership. Subsequently, new rules related to land access by tenants were introduced. Both ownership and access by tenants relied on a different mix of formal and informal practices, as evidenced by formal contracts, petits papiers and a new paper contract. The new paper contract provides tenants the rights to rent the land for up to 25 years. The titling programme also enhanced on-going processes of intensification and commercialisation, as evidenced by increased use of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and the regression of the OPBCS. The long-duration fallow periods did not improve biological and chemical soil fertility. Long-duration fallows are rather used as an expression of control over land. <b>Mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and organic amendments (household waste) explain lack of effects of fallowing. Application of household waste and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> did not change soil organic matter content. Organic amendments increased maize yields more than <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> Household waste did not improve agronomic use efficiency of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> I suggest that formal and customary land tenure institutions can be blended to generate a hybrid system.

The application of OAs to soil supplies macro- and micro-nutrients, improves soil chemical and physical properties and promotes plant growth (Quilty and Cattle 2011). Organic compounds, including biochar, are negatively charged because of the phenolic and carboxyl groups in their structure (Verheijen et al. 2009; Widowati et al. 2011) and increase surface negative charge (Naidu and Syers 1992) that may lead to increased cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Chan et al. 2008; Peng et al. 2011; Widowati et al. 2011) and improve soil fertility. The applications of these OAs, including manures and biochar have also been shown to increase pH to more favourable levels for plant growth in acidic soils (Naidu and Syers 1992; Whalen et al. 2000; Amiri and Fallahi 2009; Yuan et al. 2011).|$|R
