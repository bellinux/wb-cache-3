5000|$|The postcards were {{displayed}} in pigeonholes {{that used to}} integral to the sorting of post before the new <b>mechanised</b> <b>sorting</b> machines. The use of the pigeonholes allowed for the viewer of the exhibition to view [...] "both sides" [...] of the postcard. The pigeonholes were fitted with clear Perspex frames, which were mounted on a rotating spindle. This allowed the viewer to see [...] "both sides" [...] of the postcard, and thus creating an interactive element to the exhibition. This innovative way of displaying the postcards was designed by Fiona Coffey.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} {{stress in the}} Venus clam Chamelea gallina during hydraulic dredging were assessed in both laboratory and field studies {{in order to measure}} physiological biomarkers at organism level (clearance rate, respiration rate, scope for growth, and survival in air test). In the laboratory, mechanical stress was simulated by shaking clams in a vortex mixer. In the field, clams were collected seasonally at two sites along the northern Adriatic coast (Lido and Jesolo) and four levels of stress were applied: the highest was that used in commercial fishing (i. e. high water pressure and <b>mechanised</b> <b>sorting)</b> and the lowest manual sampling by SCUBA divers. Survival in air was the most sensitive biomarker in evaluating mechanical stress in the laboratory. Clearance rate also decreased significantly when shaking was applied. Field results indicated that high water pressure and <b>mechanised</b> <b>sorting</b> affected clearance, scope for growth and survival in air, all showing decreasing trends as mechanical stress increased at both sampling sites. The detrimental effects of mechanical disturbance may be emphasised depending on season, when exogenous and endogenous stress increases. A potential risk is highlighted mostly for undersized clams that are fished and then discarded...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The "out of Africa" model {{postulating}} single "southern route" dispersal posits {{arrival of}} "Anatomically Modern Human" to Indian subcontinent around 66 â€“ 70 thousand years before present (kyBP). However the contributions and legacy of these earliest settlers in contemporary Indian populations, {{owing to the}} complex past population dynamics and later migrations has been an issue of controversy. The high frequency of mitochondrial lineage "M 2 " consistent with its greater age and distribution suggests that it may represent the phylogenetic signature of earliest settlers. Accordingly, we attempted to re-evaluate the impact and contribution of earliest settlers in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of contemporary Indian populations; using our newly sequenced 72 and 4 published complete mitochondrial genomes of this lineage. Results The M 2 lineage, harbouring two deep rooting subclades M 2 a and M 2 b encompasses approximately one tenth of the mtDNA pool of studied tribes. The phylogeographic spread and diversity indices of M 2 and its subclades among the tribes of different geographic regions and linguistic phyla were investigated in detail. Further the reconstructed demographic history of M 2 lineage as a surrogate of earliest settlers' component revealed that the demographic events with pronounced regional variations had played pivotal {{role in shaping the}} complex net of populations phylogenetic relationship in Indian subcontinent. Conclusion Our results suggest that tribes of southern and eastern region along with Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic speakers of central India are the modern representatives of earliest settlers of subcontinent. The Last Glacial Maximum aridity and post LGM population growth <b>mechanised</b> some <b>sort</b> of homogeneity and redistribution of earliest settlers' component in India. The demic diffusion of agriculture and associated technologies around 3 kyBP, which might have marginalized hunter-gatherer, is coincidental with the decline of earliest settlers' population during this period. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed code marking and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent code marks used by the <b>mechanised</b> letter <b>sorting</b> machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of code marking letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from optical brightening agents (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on coding desks is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at coding desk rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{experimental}} hydraulic dredging was assessed on Chamelea gallina populations in two sites along the north-western Adriatic coast (Lido and Jesolo) by detecting and quantifying shell {{damage caused by}} fishing operations on both captured and discarded clams. Various levels of stress were applied, the highest being that used by commercial fishing vessels, which employ high water pressure and <b>mechanised</b> <b>sorting</b> and the lowest manual sampling of clams by scuba divers. Water pressure and sorting significantly increased shell damage, the highest levels always being observed in commercially dredged clams. At Lido, damage was mostly due to {{the action of the}} mechanised sorter; at Jesolo, the effect of high water pressure was more clearcut. Moreover, clams collected at Jesolo had both higher mean damage level and higher numbers of damaged individuals compared to the Lido samples. These differences seem to be mostly related to differing bottom features in the two sites. A positive relationship was observed between damage level and clam size: small-sized samples (length < 17 mm) were less damaged than medium-sized ones (25 mm < length < 17 mm) and commercial size clams (< 25 mm) showed the highest damage level. The severe and harmful physical impact of hydraulic dredging was apparent in captured and then discarded animals, a small fraction of which appears able to recover, as shown by the presence of clams with repaired shells...|$|E
