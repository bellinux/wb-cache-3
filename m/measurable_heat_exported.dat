40|$|Thermal {{pollution}} from urban runoff {{is considered to}} be a significant contributor to the degradation of coldwater ecosystems. Impervious surfaces (streets, parking lots and buildings) are characteristic of urban watersheds. A model for predicting rainfall runoff temperatures and runoff rates from an impervious surface (parking lot) is described in this report. The model has been developed from basic principles. It is a portion of a larger project to develop a modeling tool to assess the impact of urban development on the temperature of coldwater streams. Heat transfer and runoff processes on an impervious surface were investigated for both dry and wet weather periods. The principal goal of the effort was to describe and quantify the heat transfer between a paved surface and storm water runoff during a rainfall event. A kinematic wave scheme was used to predict runoff flow rates as a function of distance and time on a paved surface, and a numerical approximation of the 1 -D unsteady heat diffusion equation was used to calculate temperature distributions in the sub-surface. Equations to predict the magnitude of the radiative, convective, conductive and evaporative heat fluxes at a dry or wet surface, using standard climate data as input, were developed. The model can simulate surface runoff (flow) and temperature continuously throughout a specified time period (e. g. a month) or for a single rainfall event. It also predicts the ‘total heat export’ for an event, which is defined as the heat contained in the runoff above a reference temperature. A sensitivity study was performed to investigate the extent to which <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> is affected by antecedent pavement temperature, characteristics of the rainfall event, and physical parameters of the paved surface. In general, it was found that <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> was more sensitive to rainfall intensity, rainfall duration, and antecedent pavement temperature conditions than the physical properties of the paved surface (slope, roughness, length). It was also found that lower-intensity events extracted more heat from the pavement per depth of rainfall than higher-intensity events, and an increase in rainfall duration increased the total event <b>heat</b> <b>export,</b> especially for higher-intensity events. Finally, atmospheric forcing was determined to have a significant influence on runoff temperature and <b>heat</b> <b>export,</b> leading to a reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> that was a function of rainfall intensity.

40|$|A common {{assumption}} in stream {{water temperature}} modeling is that rooftops {{of all types}} contribute very little heat to runoff from rainfall. In this report we examine the accuracy of this assumption (a) by analyzing temperature data which we recorded on a residential rooftop, a commercial rooftop, and a concrete driveway, and (b) by simulating temperature profiles within rooftops and pavements, and estimating heat transfer from these surfaces to rainfall runoff. Analysis of both wet- and dry-weather temperature data which we recorded over periods of several months allowed us to conclude that a driveway has a far greater capacity for heat storage and release than a rooftop, although the commercial rooftop was able to store and release more heat than the residential rooftop. On sunny days and prior to rainfall, rooftops can reach higher temperatures than paved surfaces, but not much heat is stored, and roof temperatures drop rapidly as cloud cover increases with an approaching storm. Interestingly, weather events leading to the highest dew point (rainfall) and surface temperatures often occurred during late night or early morning hours, contrary to the expectation that the worst-case runoff heating events would occur during daylight hours. The analysis conducted for three rainfall events showed that the <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> from the commercial rooftop was roughly three {{times that of the}} residential rooftop, but only 30 %- 90 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> from the concrete driveway. Potential <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> was significantly higher for the driveway than for either rooftop. In conclusion, the results of the data analysis and <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> simulations support the assumption that residential rooftops contribute very little heating to runoff from rainfall. Commercial rooftops may have a thermal impact on rainfall runoff because of their greater thermal storage capacity. An asphalt pavement, (road or driveway) is expected to have a greater thermal impact than a concrete pavement. Commercial rooftops in addition to asphalt and concrete pavements should be considered when the water temperatures of rainfall runoff from highly urbanized areas are estimated.

40|$|This report {{describes}} work {{to analyze}} runoff temperatures and runoff <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> rates {{for a variety}} of terrestrial land covers and aquatic surfaces. Surface runoff temperatures and <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> have been simulated for ten terrestrial covers, an unshaded wet detention pond, a lake/reservoir, and a vegetated pond. A continuous simulation was run from April 1 to October 31, yielding a total of about 280 precipitation events for six years (1998 - 2000, 2003 - 2005). Six years of 15 -minute climate data from the weather station at the MnROAD facility in Albertville, MN, were used as model input. In general, the variation in average runoff temperatures from terrestrial land covers and open water surfaces was moderate, from 24. 9 °C for concrete to 21. 5 °C for a forest. Pavements, commercial rooftops, bare soil, wet detention ponds, and lakes/reservoirs were all found to give runoff temperatures high enough to significantly impact stream temperature. Vegetated surfaces gave substantially lower runoff temperature and <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> than paved surfaces. Runoff temperatures from bare soils were consistently higher than from vegetated surfaces, but lower than from pavements. Residential roofs gave, on average, low runoff temperatures, due to very low thermal mass, while commercial roofs gave high runoff temperatures in some cases. Large water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) generally give very high runoff temperatures, but the quantity of runoff is highly dependent on the water level prior to the storm event. Analysis of a vegetated pond indicates that shading from emergent vegetation can reduce runoff temperature up to 6 °C compared to an unshaded pond.

40|$|Thermal {{pollution}} {{by surface}} runoff from urban areas {{can contribute to}} the degradation of coldwater ecosystems. The hydrothermal characteristics of surface runoff from rainfall are therefore of interest. Three hydrothermal parameters of surface runoff have been studied: runoff temperature (oC), heat flux (W/m 2) and total <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> (J/m 2). <b>Heat</b> fluxes were defined above a reference temperature of 20 oC. The results can be used to identify storm events that have the potential for the largest <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> from a watershed and consequently the strongest thermal pollution of a receiving coldwater stream. In this study, records of rainfall events and weather data are used to estimate the three hydrothermal parameters by model simulation. The model for predicting rainfall runoff temperatures and rates from an impervious surface (parking lot) has been described in Project Report No. 484 from the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota (Herb et al 2006). The weather data came from the MnROAD test site in Albertville, MN, and from the SAMSON data set. Runoff temperatures and <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> were calculated for a 100 x 100 m paved surface using 6 years of 15 minute weather data or 30 years of 1 -hour weather data. The 6 -year data set contained 280 rainfall events from April through October. The 280 values of the three hydrothermal parameters were related to basic rainfall event parameters such as total rainfall, duration, and rainfall temperature (dew point). Average runoff temperature was found to be well correlated to dew point temperature during the storm, and air temperature and solar radiation prior to the storm. 20 extreme values of the hydrothermal parameters were ranked and also related to basic rainfall parameters. Partial duration series of hydrothermal parameters were analyzed separately for frequency of occurrence (return periods). Minnesota Pollution Control Agenc...|$|R

The scalar potential of the divergent component of the horizontal heat flux is computed, which gives a 'coarse-grained' image of the surface heat flux that captures the large-scale structure of the horizontal heat transport. Further the non-divergent component is examined, as well as the meridional heat transport and the temperature–latitude overturning stream function. A sensitivity analysis examines the heat transport response to changes in wind stress at different latitudes. The results are compared with results from an eddy-permitting global circulation model. The westerly wind stress over the Southern Ocean has two effects: a local reduction of the surface heat loss in response to the equatorward surface Ekman drift, and a global re-routing of the <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> from the Indo-Pacific. Without wind forcing, the Indo-Pacific <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> is released to the atmosphere in the Southern Ocean, and the net heat transport in the southern Atlantic is southward.

This study analyses the energy and exergy performance of a Finnish nearly zero-energy building (nZEB) as a heat and electricity prosumer, and proposes alternative energy topologies to improve energy and exergy levels, primary energy demand and CO 2 emissions. The results show that increasing the installed capacity of the photovoltaic systems would lead to zero energy, exergy, emissions and a balance of primary energy. However, by instead using the surplus electricity to drive a <b>heat</b> pump and <b>export</b> <b>heat,</b> the currently installed capacity {{would lead to a}} net energy export of over 4000  kWh/a. Thus, energy conversion could significantly enhance the contribution from heat and electricity prosumers to smart energy grids, though not without affecting other criteria.

The process of identifying necessary data is outlined, as well as a general strategy for organizing the input data and setting up the model for this particular watershed. A catch basin at the outlet of the development was instrumented for flow and temperature, and data were collected at the site from August 25, 2005 to October 1, 2005. The model was run for three rainfall events, and a comparison was made between observed and simulated flow rate and flow temperature at the development outlet. Overall, the model performed well. The RMSE for flow was 42. 0 L/s, 10. 4 L/s, and 14. 3 L/s for the three events respectively, and the corresponding RMSE in storm water runoff temperature was 1. 6 °C, 1. 2 °C, and 1. 9 °C. Observed and simulated volumeaveraged mean runoff temperature differed by less than 1. 5 ºC for all three events. Total volume of runoff was predicted with reasonable accuracy by the model, especially for the first two events. <b>Heat</b> <b>export,</b> which {{is a measure of the}} heat content of the runoff above a certain reference temperature (in this case 16. 0 °C), was accurately predicted for the second and third events.

During peak radiation, thermistor data showed small temperature differences (∼ 0. 003 °C– 0. 04 °C) between depths suggesting minor thermal stratification in the canal center. DTS data from cables at these same depths show differences of 0. 01 °C– 0. 17 °C.

For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) {{has been the subject of}} spectacular experimental advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no <b>measurable</b> <b>heating</b> for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.

These two components are linked {{to one another in}} varying degrees by regions of strong sensible heating (Indo-Asian landmass) and strong latent <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> (the Western Pacific Warm Pool and the southern subtropical Indian Ocean). Variability within the Indian and East Asian subsystems, interactions among them, {{and the extent to which}} they interact with other climate phenomena (e. g., ENSO) are current topics of modern and paleoclimate research. This work provides an overview of past and current paleomonsoon research on tectonic to interannual time scales with a primary focus on marine sediment records. While past and current work has contributed greatly to our understanding of paleomonsoon variability at all time scales, additional efforts are required to make further progress in two critical areas. (1) Additional efforts are needed in terms of proxy development and evaluation, requiring concerted efforts at long-term sediment trap deployments in key monsoon-influenced regions as well as development of adequate and widely available core-top databases. These are necessary to assess the impact of modern oceanographic and seafloor processes on potential monsoon proxies. (2) Additional effort is also needed in acquiring a sufficient geographic distribution of downcore records to assess linkages among the subsystems and their role in the context of extratropical climate change. These records should have high sedimentation rates (including varved sections). This requires substantial survey support to identify the most appropriate coring and drilling targets.

40|$|Deep water {{formation}} in climate models {{is indicative of}} their ability to simulate future ocean circulation, carbon and heat uptake, and sea level rise. Present-day temperature, salinity, sea ice concentration and ocean transport in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas from 23 CMIP 5 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5) models are compared with observations to assess the biases, causes and consequences of North Atlantic deep convection in models. The majority of models convect too deep, over too large an area, too often and too far south. Deep convection occurs at the sea ice edge and is most realistic in models with accurate sea ice extent, mostly those using the CICE model. Half of the models convect in response to local cooling or salinification of the surface waters; only a third have a dynamic relationship between freshwater coming from the Arctic and deep convection. The models with the most intense deep convection have the warmest deep waters, due to a redistribution of heat through the water column. For the majority of models, the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is explained by the volumes of deep water produced in the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas up to 2  years before. In turn, models with the strongest AMOC have the largest <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> to the Arctic. Understanding the dynamical drivers of deep convection and AMOC in models is hence key to realistically forecasting Arctic oceanic warming and its consequences for the global ocean circulation, cryosphere and marine life...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{circulation}} in a Snowball Earth {{is critical for}} determining cloud behavior, <b>heat</b> <b>export</b> from the tropics, regions of bare ice, and sea glacier flow. These processes strongly affect Snowball Earth deglaciation {{and the ability of}} oases to support photosynthetic marine life throughout a Snowball Earth. Here we establish robust aspects of the Snowball Earth atmospheric circulation by running six general circulation models with consistent Snowball Earth boundary conditions. The models produce qualitatively similar patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation minus evaporation. The strength of the Snowball Hadley circulation is roughly double modern at low CO 2 and greatly increases as CO 2 is increased. We force a 1 -D axisymmetric sea glacier model with general circulation model (GCM) output and show that, neglecting zonal asymmetry, sea glaciers would limit ice thickness variations to O(10 %). Global mean ice thickness in the 1 -D sea glacier model is well-approximated by a 0 -D ice thickness model with global mean surface temperature as the upper boundary condition. We then show that a thin-ice Snowball solution is possible in the axysymmetric sea glacier model when forced by output from all the GCMs if we use ice optical properties that favor the thin-ice solution. Finally, we examine Snowball oases for life using analytical models forced by the GCM output and find that conditions become more favorable for oases as the Snowball warms, so that the most critical time for the survival of life would be near the beginning of a Snowball Earth episode. Key Points Snowball Hadley cell is stronger than modern and increases with CO 2 in six GCMs GCMs produce a similar Snowball P-E pattern with net ablation in the tropics Sea glacier thickness variations and oases are more favorable as Snowball ages © 2013.

40|$|Residential and {{commercial}} development dramatically alters {{the surface and}} groundwater hydrology of watersheds. Increasing areas of impervious surfaces can lead to higher peak stream flows and reduced baseflow, which both can lead to degradation of fish habitat. In addition, thermal pollution from surface runoff is increasing recognized as an additional mechanism for fish habitat degradation in coldwater stream systems. Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) such as infiltration ponds, rain gardens, and swales are often used to reduce stormwater surface runoff rates and volumes, and to increase infiltration and groundwater recharge. Wet detention ponds used to limit runoff flow rates and reduce sediment loads {{are not likely to}} reduce thermal loading, since there is no reliable mechanism for volume or temperature reduction. Infiltration practices that capture all of smaller storms and initial portion of larger storms are very likely to significantly reduce thermal loading, since the warmest surface runoff typically happens during low volume storms and the initial portions of larger storms. To predict changes in thermal loading to streams due to land use changes, a simulation model of runoff temperature is currently being developed as part of a research project that SAFL is conducting for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (“Development and Implementation of a Tool to Predict and Assess the Impact of Stormwater Runoff on Trout Streams”). The current version of the tool, MINUHET (MINnesota Urban <b>Heat</b> <b>Export</b> Tool), has components for simulating runoff volume and temperature for mixed land use sub-divisions, routing of runoff flow and heat through both conventional storm sewer systems and pervious channels, and for simulating wet ponds and infiltration ponds. Thus, MINUHET has the capability to quantify the reduction in thermal loading due to the addition of infiltration practices. Vermillion River Watershed Joint Powers Organizatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformational}} behaviour {{of shape}} memory alloy (SMA) wires embedded into a fibre reinforced epoxy composite was investigated and is discussed in this article. The effects on the transformational temperatures, and heats of the embedded SMA wires and the generation of recovery stresses within the composites on heating are shown {{to be related to}} the reversible martensitic transformation of the SMA wires. This article details the effects of the constraining matrix on the transformations of self-accommodating and preferentially oriented martensite. It was found that there is little change in the transformation temperatures of the constrained SMA wires with increasing pre-strain, but that the <b>measurable</b> transformation <b>heats</b> decrease significantly with increasing pre-strain. It is concluded that the transformation of self-accommodating martensite is nearly not affected by the constrained matrix, whereas the transformation of the preferentially oriented martensite is suppressed.
