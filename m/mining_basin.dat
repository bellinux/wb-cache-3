25|$|Most of the war's major battles {{occurred}} in France and the French countryside was heavily scarred in the fighting. Furthermore, in 1918 during the German retreat, German troops devastated France's most industrialized {{region in the}} north-east (Nord-Pas de Calais <b>Mining</b> <b>Basin).</b> Extensive looting took place as German forces removed whatever material they could use and destroyed the rest. Hundreds of mines were destroyed along with railways, bridges, and entire villages. Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau was determined, for these reasons, that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it had caused. Clemenceau viewed reparations {{as a way of}} weakening Germany to ensure it could never threaten France again. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, including Belgium, which was also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations, arguing for a smaller sum that was less damaging to the German economy so that Germany could remain a viable economic power and trading partner. He also argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances for war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions and was adamant that no indemnity should be imposed upon Germany.|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} {{high degree of}} conflicts between development and developmental goals is an objective condition {{that one has to}} face in planning in large <b>mining</b> <b>basins.</b> Numerous conflicts exist: between wider public larger social interests (land occupation, removal-power production), short-term and long-term goals, specific and general aims, etc. Basic developmental conflicts exist in the relationship between the miming-energy-industrial system and its environment, and they are manifested in areas of regional development, incompatible production functions (mining-agriculture), lend use and organization, exploitation of natural resources, and environmental degradation. Thus, {{one of the most important}} planning task in large <b>mining</b> <b>basins</b> is to identify, evaluate, confront and compare development conflicts and developmental goals. The task of the planning process is to offer objective parameters (indices) concerning the state of development, its potentials and limitations, as well as the concept of alternative strategies of future development, including their possible effects, conversion of larger social priorities into criteria for evaluating alternative strategies, i. e. to offer adequate analytical documents as a platform for the expression of goals and interests of numerous social subjects and their harmonization in the process of participation in planing decision making...|$|R

50|$|The Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 {{with the}} {{discovery}} and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the <b>mining</b> <b>basins</b> of Nalón and Caudal. At the same time, there was significant migration to America (especially Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.|$|R

The soil contamination by heavy metals of study area was studied using two parameters; (i) Comparison of the heavy metals concentrations with mean concentrations in most world soils, (ii) Enrichment Factor (EF). Results revealed that the concentrations of heavy metals were varying in the study area, the highest concentrations were obtained at the center of mining area particularly inside the <b>mining</b> <b>basins</b> of gold extraction. The concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, and Pb were ranged from (4. 85 to 34. 65 mg kg- 1 soil), (6, 355 to 14, 635 mg kg- 1 soil), (37. 35 to 655 mg kg- 1 soil), (11. 85 to 42. 7 mg kg- 1 soil), (0 to 16. 5 mg kg- 1 soil,) (2. 5 to 47. 3 mg kg- 1 soil) and (2. 65 to 823. 5 mg kg- 1 soil), respectively. The results also indicated that the soil samples which collected from inside <b>mining</b> <b>basins</b> have a highest EF for most heavy metals particularly Pb, which showed EF value of (676. 3), suggesting that the Pb may be derived from anthropogenic source. This study recommends regular monitoring of heavy metals in the soils around the Artisanal gold Mining for conservation and protection from pollution...|$|R

40|$|Environmental noise {{constitutes}} a threat regarding disturbance and deterioration {{of quality of}} living. There are numerous sources of environmental noise, among others mine objects, traffic roads etc. In Serbian practice open cast mines are commonly in vicinity of residential areas, which {{is the case of}} the Field C open cast coal mine and the Barosevac settlement. More complexity is added to noise management in such conditions through additional noise sources, not directly linked to mine objects and activities, such as local or regional roads. This paper describes an approach to noise management for the purpose of environmental noise impact reduction, from both traffic and industrial sources, related to the project Environmental Improvement Project in Kolubara <b>Mine</b> <b>Basin</b> in Barosevac settlement, as a part of acquisition of new Excavator-belt Conveyor-Stacker (ECS) system...|$|R

50|$|For {{the last}} 10 years the Kolubara <b>mine</b> <b>basin</b> has been {{expanding}} towards the settlements causing conflicts between inhabitants and mines. This problem affects around 6000 families. During the last decade, Elektroprivreda Srbije has moved hundreds of households, two complete villages and partially 10 villages. Resettlement {{caused by the}} Tamnava West expansion in 2003 was not done according to good standards, the main reason being shortage of funds, which led to slowing down of the land acquisition {{and development of the}} proposed infrastructure. In the end, they were never conducted, which diminished credibility of Elektroprivreda Srbije in the eyes of inhabitants. With continued expansion of the mine, the relocation of households became urgent and residents were under enormous pressure to accept financial compensation and leave the territory designated for coal excavation. The value of their property was often underestimated.|$|R
