The final diagnoses were hemangioma (five), hepatocellular carcinoma (four), focal nodular hyperplasia (one), adenoma (one), metastasis (two), abscess (two), echinococcal cyst (one), tumor of unknown origin (three), cirrhosis (one). Contrast enhanced images were obtained during the early vascular phases after intravenous bolus injection of Gd-DOTA at a dose of 0. 1 mmol/kg (0. 2 ml/kg). After Gd-DOTA, positive contrast enhancement was seen in 11 cases, negative enhancement in 4, and nonenhancement in 6. Contrast patterns were similar to contrast enhanced CT. In terms of visibility of lesions, the unenhanced motion-compensated T 2 SE sequences were superior to the nonenhanced gradient echo sequences in 12 patients and equal in 8. After gadolinium enhancement, T 2 -weighted SE images were superior to the postcontrast gradient echo images in eight cases, equal in eight and inferior in four cases. status: publishe...|$|E
