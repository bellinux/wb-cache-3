5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E

40|$|To examine bat - habitat relationships, {{ultrasonic}} detectors {{were used}} to sample bat activity among: old-growth white pine (Pinus strobus), mature white pine, boreal mixedwood, and selectively-cut white pine stands in central Ontario. Within the stands, bats were sampled in the canopy, the understory layer, and within canopy gaps. Forest structure was measured {{within each of the}} stands. The activity of bats was compared among forest stand types, within the stands, and in relation to forest structure. Also, maintaining forest wildlife populations requires data on the use of snags (i. e. dead trees).

50|$|Bent-winged bats are {{typically}} small (total length c. 10 cm, wingspans 30-35 cm, mass less than 20 g), with broad, short muzzles. The cranium is bulbous and {{taller than the}} snout, a feature shared with woolly <b>bats</b> and <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bats.</b> This combination of features was likely present in the common ancestor of the vesper bats.

50|$|The cave {{has been}} home to large groups of bats in the past. Despite the cave's {{entrance}} being covered by grills the cave was entered by youths who set off fireworks to disturb the bats. In November 1966, the cave was surveyed by the Gibraltar Cave Research Group; a painted sign on the cave's wall mentions this. An estimated 5000 Schreibers' bats Miniopterus schreibersii and 1000 large <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bats</b> Myotis myotis were there in the 60s. There were no bats in 2002, despite it being an offence to interfere with bat populations in caves in Gibraltar.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} century bat populations {{significantly}} declined mainly due to habitat fragmentation and degradation. As management-dependent species, bats need appropriate monitoring programs {{for the implementation of}} sound conservation strategies. However, bats’ small size, high mobility, elusiveness and nocturnal lifestyle make them difficult to survey. Non-Invasive Genetic Sampling (NIGS) may offer safe and cost-effective solutions, but requires well-planned sampling strategies, informative molecular markers and reliable laboratory protocols. Here we developed a NIGS protocol for species and individual identification of three <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bats,</b> the Geoffroy’s bat (Myotis emarginatus), the long-fingered bat (Myotis capaccinii) and the Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii). Species identification was accomplished by mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequencing of reference tissue (n= 49) and droppings (n= 285) from Central-Northern Italy. In addition, we optimized a multiplex panel of seven microsatellites suitable for species and individual identification of the three species from droppings. We obtained a good success with mtDNA sequencing (245 / 285; 86 %) and microsatellite genotyping (129 / 245; 53 %). All microsatellites were successfully amplified with low error rates, and were polymorphic in the three Myotis species, with probabilities of identity 6 0. 001 and observed heterozygosities of Ho= 0. 48 in M. emarginatus, 0. 62 in M. capaccinii and 0. 71 in M. daubentonii. Our protocol represents a useful tool for population genetic studies on <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bats</b> that could likely be extended to other bat species and provide useful information to implement effective conservation plans...|$|R
