5000|$|At airports, the <b>marshaller</b> {{signals the}} pilot to keep turning, slow down, stop, {{and shut down}} engines, leading the {{aircraft}} to its parking stand or to the runway. Sometimes, the <b>marshaller</b> indicates directions to the pilot by driving a [...] "Follow-Me" [...] car (usually a yellow van or pick-up truck with a checkerboard pattern) prior to disembarking and resuming signalling, though {{this is not an}} industry standard.|$|E
50|$|Marshalling is {{one-on-one}} {{visual communication}} {{and a part}} of aircraft ground handling. It may be as an alternative to, or additional to, radio communications between the aircraft and air traffic control. The usual equipment of a <b>marshaller</b> is a reflecting safety vest, a helmet with acoustic earmuffs, and gloves or marshaling wands-handheld illuminated beacons.|$|E
5000|$|Interoperability can be {{bidirectional}} {{sharing of}} data and methods between unmanaged code and managed [...]NET code[...]NET provides two ways of interoperating between the two: COM Interop and P/Invoke. Though the methodology is different, in both cases marshalling (conversion between representations of data, formats for calling functions and formats for returning values) must take place. COM Interop deals with this conversion between managed code and COM objects, whereas P/Invoke handles interactions between managed code and Win32 code. The concept of blittable and non-blittable data types applies to both—specifically {{to the problem of}} converting data between managed and unmanaged memory. This marshalling is performed by the interop <b>marshaller,</b> which is invoked automatically by the CLR when needed.|$|E

5000|$|To {{accomplish}} both actions, Bluebeard 3 had to {{be moved}} from directly behind the EC-130. The aircraft couldn't be moved by ground taxi and {{had to be}} moved by hover taxi (flying a short distance at low speed and altitude). A USAF Combat Controller attempted to direct the maneuver from in front of the aircraft, but was blasted by desert sand churned up by the rotor. As the Controller attempted to back away, Bluebeard 3 pilot perceived he was drifting backward (engulfed in a dust cloud, the pilot only had the Controller as a point of reference) and thus attempted to [...] "correct" [...] this situation by applying forward stick {{in order to maintain the}} same distance from the rearward moving <b>marshaller.</b> The RH-53 struck the EC-130's vertical stabilizer with its main rotor and crashed into the EC-130's wing root.|$|E
50|$|The rank of air chief <b>marshal</b> is {{immediately}} senior {{to the rank}} of air <b>marshal</b> but subordinate to <b>marshal</b> of the air force. Air chief <b>marshals</b> are sometimes generically considered to be air <b>marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 1943 {{the ranks}} of <b>marshal</b> of the air force, <b>marshal</b> of the {{artillery}} and <b>marshal</b> of the armoured corps came into existence.

50|$|When {{the rank}} of chief <b>marshal</b> of the branch was established, {{the size of the}} {{shoulder}} board stars for <b>marshals</b> was made about 10mm smaller, indicating the superiority of the <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union.

5000|$|Marshal: Supervises a {{specific}} combat-related activity, insuring safety of participants and refereeing where applicable.

5000|$|The rank of vice <b>marshal</b> (chasu) {{is unique}} to the North Korean ranking system. Vice <b>marshal</b> was first conferred in February 1953 on Choe Yong Gon. Sources suggest that the {{shoulder}} board rank insignia for <b>marshal</b> and vice <b>marshal</b> then became a single large star without the state coat-of-arms (for <b>marshals)</b> and the state coat-of-arms without a star (for vice <b>marshals).</b> By the time the next conferral of rank to vice <b>marshal</b> was awarded (1985), the shoulder board rank insignia for <b>marshal</b> and vice <b>marshal</b> had taken on their current design.The next change in the DPRK <b>marshal</b> ranks took place in 1992 when the rank of dae wonsu or grand <b>marshal</b> (full title grand <b>marshal</b> of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) was created for Kim Il Sung. At this time the rank of <b>marshal</b> was divided into two ranks: the rank of <b>marshal</b> with the title [...] "marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" [...] was conferred upon Kim Il Sung's son Kim Jong-il, and the same rank but with the title [...] "marshal of the Korean People's Army" [...] was conferred upon O Jin U. In 1995, two other military officers were conferred the rank of <b>marshal</b> with the title [...] "marshals of the Korean People's Army", i.e. Choe Kwang and Ri Ul Sol. Insignia of rank of the two grades of <b>marshal</b> are different (with the insignia for <b>marshal</b> of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea being more like that of grand marshal—the grand <b>marshal</b> insignia has a larger wreath encompassing the <b>marshal's</b> star—but is smaller as it is below the star itself).|$|R
50|$|Almost all British <b>marshals</b> are unpaid volunteers {{supplemented}} occasionally {{by certain}} paid crews for special duties. <b>Marshals</b> are {{registered with the}} British governing body, the Motor Sports Association(MSA) and are often members of organisations such as Intervention <b>Marshals</b> UK (IVMUK), the British Motorsport <b>Marshals</b> Club (BMMC), British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) and the Silverstone <b>Marshals</b> Team amongst many others. British <b>marshals</b> {{have been known to}} attend foreign events such as IndyCar, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and many F1 events worldwide. Motorcycle <b>marshals</b> are organized differently, with support for FIM events coming from Racesafe and Racesafe-accredited <b>marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Marshals</b> of {{branches}} were normally eligible for promotion to chief <b>marshal</b> of branch, however, neither was eligible for promotion to <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union. After 1984, {{the rank of}} <b>marshal</b> was preserved only {{in the air force}} and artillery. Later, the rank of <b>marshal</b> stopped being conferred even in these branches. The regulations of Russian Army, confirmed in 1993, unified the system of general ranks in all the branches: the ranks of <b>marshal</b> of artillery and <b>marshal</b> of aviation were replaced by the one of general of the army (or army aviation), and the rank of chief <b>marshal</b> was cancelled.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. {{court system}} {{is divided into}} 94 federal {{judicial}} districts, each with a district court (except the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which share a US <b>Marshal).</b> For each district there is a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed United States <b>marshal,</b> a Chief Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> (GS-14 or 15) (and an Assistant Chief Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> (GS-14) in certain larger districts), Supervisory Deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> (GS-13), and as many deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> (GS-7 and above) and special deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> as needed. In the United States federal budget for 2005, funds for 3,067 deputy <b>marshals</b> and criminal investigators were provided. The U.S. <b>Marshal</b> for United States courts of appeals (the 13 circuit courts) is the U.S. <b>Marshal</b> in whose district that court is physically located.|$|R
50|$|The {{ranks of}} chief <b>marshal</b> of the {{branches}} of aviation, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signals were established October 27, 1943. The three former branches had already had (since February 4, 1943) the corresponding ranks of marshal; in the two latter branches the ranks of <b>marshal</b> and of chief <b>marshal</b> were established simultaneously. When the rank of chief <b>marshal</b> was established, {{the size of the}} shoulder board's stars for all <b>marshals</b> except the now superior <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union were made about 10mm smaller and for chief <b>marshals,</b> the star was surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the uniform tie, chief <b>marshals</b> wore the <b>marshal's</b> star of the 2nd level. During the next forty years, the ranks of chief <b>marshal</b> were conferred mainly on deputy defense ministers - commanders of the corresponding branch. The ranks of chief <b>marshal</b> of engineer troops and chief <b>marshal</b> of signals, abolished in 1984, were never conferred on anybody. No chief <b>marshal</b> promotions were conferred after 1984. The youngest chief <b>marshal</b> was aviator Golovanov, 40 when promoted in 1944. Three of thirteen people who held the chief <b>marshal</b> rank did not retire normally: Novikov was imprisoned for seven years; Nedelin perished in the flame of an exploded rocket; Varentsov was accused of heedlessness, dismissed and degraded (his subordinate, Oleg Penkovsky, had been found to be a spy).|$|R
