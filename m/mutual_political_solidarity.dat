5000|$|In <b>Political</b> <b>Solidarity,</b> Scholz {{argues for}} greater nuance in {{the meaning of}} {{solidarity}} and highlights three distinct types of solidarity: social solidarity, civic <b>solidarity,</b> and <b>political</b> <b>solidarity.</b> She finds all three types of solidarity importantly distinct, although they do have some unifying characteristics. Scholz goes to great efforts to avoid vagueness when discussing concepts, providing concrete articulations of concepts like 'injustice' and 'oppression,' rather resorting to vague or demogogic treatments of such concepts. Scholz notes that effective <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> can only occur through a [...] "genuine mutually shared commitment to a cause." [...] Scholz argues that <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> is a moral relation among humans; <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> with non-human animals, then, is not possible but <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> on behalf of nonhuman animals is. Some ecofeminists have challenged her on this point, seeking to conceptualize solidarity with non-humans. [...] Scholz has suggested that a more fruitful approach is {{to think of the}} moral relations of social solidarity with non-human animals.|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{argue that}} <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> is {{important}} to justice. At its core, <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> is a relational concept. To be in a relation of political soli-darity {{is to be in}} a relation of connection or unity with one’s fellow citizens. I argue that citizens of a shared state can be said to stand in such a relation when they have attitudes of collective identification, mutual respect, mutual trust, loyalty and mutual support toward one another. I argue that there are distinctly social bases for <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> and that justice requires that social and political institutions be struc-tured so that they promote these. As an example of the sort of social and political arrangements that might encourage relations of <b>political</b> <b>solidarity,</b> I discuss Canada’s response to the recent H 1 N 1 pandemic an...|$|R

In contrast, Mexican activists celebrated Marxist ideologies as radical political resistance against an increasing authoritarian government and associated Mexican nationalism with state repression and political manipulation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative research study on student teachers’ perceptions of sustainability, specifically influenced by ecological citizenship and <b>political</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Research was conducted with 18 Graduate Diploma of Education (Primary) student teachers at one university, as they only have one year in which to train as teachers. A clear conceptualisation of Education for Sustainability is required for teachers to effectively implement the Australian Curriculum, which has sustainability as a cross-curriculum priority. Subsequently, Education for Sustainability is a key issue for teacher education and particularly within the short Graduate Diploma course. The findings showed that student teachers’ perceptions of sustainability are shaped by aspects of ecological citizenship and <b>political</b> <b>solidarity,</b> and are informed by the local context. The findings also showed that the student teachers were moving from a more environmentally-centred conception of sustainability to a definition that included the other pillars of economic and socio-political sustainability. This article concludes with an argument for integrating the complex concepts of ecological citizenship and <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> within teacher education, so that student teachers graduate with the appropriate content knowledge to explore global citizenship and the ecological space with their future primary students...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} nature of the transnational solidarity movements established between Chicana/o and Mexican activists through the 1960 s and 1970 s {{in the midst of the}} Mexican Dirty War, the Chicana/o Movement, and Third World Solidarity movements. These claims of <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> between these two groups rested on ideas of a shared sense of cultural, historical, ethnic, and political origins. Through the combination of a wide range of archival sources and oral interviews collected in nine archives across Mexico and the U. S., this dissertation reconstructs the historical process of these solidarity movements from a variety of perspectives, including urban students activists, intellectuals, theater performers, Mexican government officials, and a Mexican rural Maoist armed movement. Moreover, a transnational approach allows me to rethink notions of <b>political</b> <b>solidarity,</b> and ideas of citizenship and belonging between Chicana/os and Mexicans by shifting the coordinates of analysis that traditionally privilege the U. S. as the center of the conversation and instead setting the analysis in Mexico itself. Both, Chicana/os and Mexican activists expressed a narrative of <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> against a perceived shared experience of oppression and struggles for liberation. I contend, however, that both groups saw the source of their oppression and forms of resistance through different lenses. Chicana/o activists identified racism, discrimination, and cultural erasure with oppression and the retrofitting of Mexican nationalism with political radicalism. In contrast, Mexican activists celebrated Marxist ideologies as radical political resistance against an increasing authoritarian government and associated Mexican nationalism with state repression and political manipulation. Further complicating Chicana/o-Mexican relations were issues of discrimination, classism, and prejudice between them, which I argue had a greater impact in shaping their claims of <b>political</b> <b>solidarity</b> than their perceived sense of Mexicanness.
