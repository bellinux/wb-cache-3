5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of <b>material</b> <b>fact.</b> In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E

25|$|The case {{appears to}} have {{introduced}} error of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> into Singapore case law as a ground of judicial review. While the term error of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> was not explicitly stated in the case, the Court applied the legal rule laid down in the UK case Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976) that a court may interfere with a government decision which {{has been based on}} a misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact, and/or an incorrect basis of fact.|$|E

However, he concluded that there were issues of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> about whether the Live Traffic paper constituted prior art. Since a grant of summary judgment requires that there be no remaining issues of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> between the parties, the majority vacated and remanded the District Court's grant of summary judgment that the Live Traffic paper invalidated the '203', '212', '338', and '615' patents.|$|E

25|$|Courts {{in several}} jurisdictions {{including}} Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK {{have followed the}} Tameside decision and recognized error of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> as a distinct ground of judicial review.

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract.

Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} still no {{certainty}} as to how judges will apply their powers of judicial review when an error of <b>material</b> <b>fact</b> has been committed. Fong Thin Choo was decided in 1991, prior to the UK case E v. Home Secretary. Hence, it still {{remains to be seen if}} the courts in Singapore will adopt the four requirements that were laid down in E v. Home Secretary. One view is that there is little reason for the courts to reject these requirements, given that Fong Thin Choo cited Tameside with approval, and E v. Home Secretary was based upon this case.|$|E
25|$|Administrative law is {{the area}} of law {{concerning}} the control of powers exercised by the government. It functions to regulate decision-making processes by public authorities with regard to maintaining basic standards of fairness and legality. Administrative law in Singapore originates from and shares many similarities with administrative law in the United Kingdom. In general, claims for judicial review in administrative law fall under three broad categories– illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Instances of illegality fall under two main headings: whether the authority was empowered {{to make the decision}} in question, and whether it properly exercised its discretion to make that decision. Grounds for illegality under the first heading include simple ultra vires, and errors as to precedent facts. The second heading includes grounds of judicial review such as making decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence or errors of <b>material</b> <b>fact,</b> failing to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones, making decisions for improper purposes, fettering of discretion, and failing to fulfil legitimate expectations.|$|E
