30|$|The {{software}} {{described above}} can potentially integrate simultaneously acquired hemodynamic and electrocardiographic digital data. These data were, however, not digitally acquired in our experimental setup, {{but from a}} video camera that was synchronized with the X-ray system (i.e. analog). First, this method allows only an inaccurate acquisition of hemodynamic data and the data were therefore not used for our data analyses. Second, the hemodynamic state for each <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> needs to be converted into digital data. This step does not only require substantial work, but is a source for conversion errors and, thus, imprecision of this methodology. In the future, direct digital acquisition of EKG and hemodynamics synchronous to the X-ray cameras is desirable.|$|E

Multiple-view reconstructions require the computation of translation and rotation parameters to transform each range map {{with reference to}} a global coordinate frame. In this paper, an automatic method has been developed to efficiently align 3 D range maps acquired by an active stereo vision system. The methodology is based on referring range maps to a global frame of fiducial markers captured by the stereo system. The procedure includes a refinement of the <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> in order to globally minimise the misalignment errors. The methodology optimises the overall accuracy of 3 D reconstructions regardless of the scanning strategies, even processing large data sets. The proposed approach has been experienced and validated by measuring both nominal shapes and industrial models...|$|E
40|$|Human gait {{analysis}} for stroke rehabilitation therapy using video processing tools has become popular in recent years. This paper proposes a single-camera system for capturing gait patterns using a Kalman-Structural- Similarity-based algorithm which tracks multiple markers simultaneously. This algorithm is initialized by obtaining the user-selected {{blocks in the}} first frame of each video, and the tracker is implemented by using Structural-Similarity image quality assessment algorithm to detect each <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> by frame within a search area determined by a discrete Kalman filter. Experimental results show the trajectories of the markers fixed on the joints of a human body. The obtained numerical results are used to generate gait information (e. g., knee joint angle) that is later used for diagnostics. The proposed method aims to explore an alternative and portable way to implement human gait analysis with significantly less cost compared to a state-of-the-art 3 D motion capture system...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{optical sensors}} {{are used to}} {{digitize}} sculptural artworks by exploiting various contactless technologies. Cultural Heritage applications may concern 3 D reconstructions of sculptural shapes distinguished by small details distributed over large surfaces. These applications require robust multi-view procedures based on aligning several high resolution 3 D measurements. In this paper, the integration of a 3 D structured light scanner and a stereo photogrammetric sensor is proposed {{with the aim of}} reliably reconstructing large free form artworks. The structured light scanner provides high resolution range maps captured from different views. The stereo photogrammetric sensor measures the spatial location of each view by tracking a <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> integral to the optical scanner. This procedure allows the computation of the rotation-translation matrix to transpose the range maps from local view coordinate systems to a unique global reference system defined by the stereo photogrammetric sensor. The artwork reconstructions can be further augmented by referring metadata related to restoration processes. In this paper, a methodology has been developed to map metadata to 3 D models by capturing spatial references using a passive stereo-photogrammetric sensor. The multi-sensor framework has been experienced through the 3 D reconstruction of a Statue of Hope located at the English Cemetery in Florence. This sculptural artwork has been a severe test due to the non-cooperative environment and the complex shape features distributed over a large surface...|$|E
40|$|The human finger {{contains}} tendon/ligament mechanisms {{essential for}} proper control. One mechanism couples {{the movements of}} the interphalangeal joints when the (unloaded) finger is flexed with active deep flexor. This study's aim was to accurately determine in a large finger sample the kinematics and variability of the coupled interphalangeal joint motions, for potential clinical and finger model validation applications. The data could also be applied to humanoid robotic hands. Sixty-eight fingers were measured in seventeen hands in nine subjects. Fingers exhibited great joint mobility variability, with passive proximal interphalangeal hyperextension ranging from zero to almost fifty degrees. Increased measurement accuracy was obtained by using marker frames to amplify finger segment motions. Gravitational forces on the marker frames were not found to invalidate measurements. The recorded interphalangeal joint trajectories were highly consistent, demonstrating the underlying coupling mechanism. The increased accuracy and large sample size allowed for evaluation of detailed trajectory variability, systematic differences between flexion and extension trajectories, and three trigger types, distinct from flexor tendon triggers, involving initial flexion deficits in either proximal or distal interphalangeal joint. The experimental methods, data and analysis should advance insight into normal and pathological finger biomechanics (e. g. swanneck deformities), and could help improve clinical differential diagnostics of trigger finger causes. The <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> measuring method may be useful to quantify interphalangeal joints trajectories in surgical/rehabilitative outcome studies.

These questions bring us face to face with the limits of the traditional dichotomic representation opposing speech and writing on the sole basis of the medium at hand.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a European public sphere (EPS) and of a European identity (EI) are the fundamental interconnected processes which decide {{the shape of the}} nowadays European polity. EU member states' citizens should have a European identity, be it a secondary one, to actively participate in private and public debates concerning EU affairs, policies and common future. A fresh perspective in the field considers that the nature of the compatibility between national and European identities (which do not exclude each other) is revealed by the process of identity emergence: while national identities are largely "cultural", European identities are primarily "instrumental". The paper argues that instrumental European identity, as the identity based on self-interest calculation, is a reality. EU has been experimenting new ways to contribute to the {{emergence of}} a EI, trying to promote to its citizens symbols as identity markers once used by nations with the same aim (such as a flag, an anthem, a currency). In the EU context, funding opportunities are also being used to fosterEI acquisition. In this theoretical context, a content analysis was conducted on two online news portals in Romania – www. hotnews. roand www. ziare. com – for the March-June 2012 time frame in order to answer questions such as: Which are the <b>markers</b> and <b>frames</b> of an instrumental European identity promoted through articles about EU funds, posted on the two news portals?; how visible are EU identity <b>markers</b> and <b>frames</b> reflected through news on the management of EU funds and the implementation of EU-funded programmes and projects?; which is the predominance of such news?; how do Romanian citizens comment on these news in terms of identity acquisition?

Studies where implant kinematics can be compared to kinematics of the natural knee of the same specimen are very rare, though. In this project, the kinematics of six fresh frozen human cadaver knees in the natural state and after replacement of the knee joint with a bi-cruciate stabilizing implant were evaluated using a knee simulator and stereophotogrammetry. Before testing, <b>frames</b> with reflective <b>markers</b> were fixed to the femur and tibia. Then, a CT scan was made and the images were processed to identify anatomical landmarks and their position with respect to the reflective markers. Thus, an anatomically relevant coordinate system could be defined for each bone. During a squat, the motion of the markers was continuously measured. Several load conditions were considered for each specimen. The data obtained enabled us to calculate the motion of the femur and tibia with respect to each other and present that in clinically relevant terms. After testing, a second CT scan was made to check the position of the implant with respect to the original articular surfaces and also for a control of the position of the <b>marker</b> <b>frames.</b> The results show that kinematics of the natural knee joint are more variable than expected.

The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results).

Results: The results showed that nose-bridge markers had minimal displacements but the middle- and side-face markers had large displacements. Conclusions: It appears that markers on the frontal nose bridge are good alternatives to transoral rigid devices for measuring mandibular motion, compared to optical <b>frame</b> <b>markers</b> and other skin markers on the face. The results of the current study will be helpful for establishing guidelines for marker placement when measuring mandibular movements in patients with potential temporomandibular disorders...|$|R

However, their integration in real settings {{is complicated by}} cost and fixed location. In this respect, building table-like environments using several handheld devices such as tablets or smartphones provides a promising alternative but is limited to touch interaction only. We propose instead another kind of “around-device” interaction (ADI) technique using the built-in front camera of these devices and fiducial <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> which presents advantages including better awareness and less interference. This paper contributes {{a first step in}} exploring the potential of this interaction technique by conducting a usability test comparing several ergonomic factors that may {{have an effect on the}} very first operation of the interaction: the acquisition of the marker...|$|R
