40|$|The report {{covers the}} work {{which has been}} done in {{conjunction}} with the design, manufacturing, integration and testing of an integrated linearized transmitter unit (ILS). The test results are all within the specifications. The integrated linearized transmitter unit consists of a short TWT (30 dB saturation gain) and an integrated linearizing front end (70 dB gain) with the EPC. The integration of the Linearizing Front End (LFE) ind the EPC reduces the <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> and increases the efficiency and improves the EMC characteristics. The new smart integrated linearized transmitter unit (ILS) has a higher efficiency, lower mass and smaller <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> on the platform in comparison with the solution of single equipment (i. e. channel amplifier, linearizer, TWT and EPC) hitherto used.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of flip chip technology {{with regard to}} electrical performance and reduced <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> are well-known. Unfortunately most of the available dice are not designed for flip chip applications with an area arrangement of the bond pads.

If the die size is determinded by the peripheral, shrinking the size requires a reduction in pitch. A reduced pitch may limit use as a flip chip, hence Chip Scale Packages (CSPs) offer a solution of this problem...|$|E

40|$|Many arcjet DC power {{supplies}} use PWM full bridge converters with large arrays of parallel FET's. This report investigates an alternative supply using a variable frequency series resonant converter with small arrays of parallel MCT's (metal oxide semiconductor controlled thyristors). The {{reasons for this}} approach are to: increase reliability by {{reducing the number of}} switching devices; and decrease the surface <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> of the switching arrays. The variable frequency series resonant approach is used because the relatively slow switching speed of the MCT precludes the use of PWM. The 10 kW converter operated satisfactorily with an efficiency of over 91 percent. Test results indicate this efficiency could be increased further by additional optimization of the series resonant inductor...|$|E
40|$|The MGB housing of a {{helicopter}} had cracked by fatigue. The fatigue crack had initiated at the radius region of the cutout adjacent to the booster <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> and propagated progressively in the vertical web over {{a distance of about}} 30 mm. The nature, location and length of the crack in this MGB housing were found to be similar to those observed in the MGB housings of helicopters PPA- 01 and PPA- 02. No metallurgical or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for fatigue crack initiation and fatigue appeared to be stress related. The most probable reason for fatigue crack initiation appears to be the high stress concentrations at the cutout surface. It also appears that with the existing design, the fatigue cracking of MGB housing is unavoidable. Certain design modifications are suggested to tackle this problem...|$|E
40|$|A {{microscopic}} translation {{device for}} a microelectromechanical system includes {{a pair of}} linear stator assemblies disposed in spaced relation to define an elongate channel.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a single-chip network-interface LSI that integrates a 500 V capacitive isolated digital coupler, a 5 V / 100 mA voltage regulator and a 1 -Mbps CAN transceiver. The coupler uses high-voltage, on-chip-isolator technology including trench isolation with buried oxide on SOI (Silicon On Insulator). The switching-voltage regulator of a step-down DC-DC converter that {{is connected to the}} network power line (11 to 25 V) supplies a constant 5 V voltage to the transceiver circuit. In addition, a network-power-supply state-monitoring function, which reports the voltage drop to a CAN controller through the insulated barrier, is provided. By connecting the SOI substrate to the network-power supply line, the electric potential that the transceiver is referenced to can follow the electric potential shift of the network by common mode noise and thus enable a dependable operation. The physical-layer interface LSI can reduce the power consumption to 20 % and reduce the <b>mounting</b> <b>area</b> of the interface circuit to 50 %...|$|E
40|$|Two cracked Main Gear-Box (MGB) {{housings}} of {{a particular}} type of helicopter were referred to the laboratory for analysis. A fatigue crack of length about 35 mm was observed in the MGB housing of helicopter PPA- 01 on the vertical web adjacent to the booster <b>mounting</b> <b>area.</b> The fatigue crack was found to start at one of the edges of the cutout and propagated progressively over a period of time. The nature, location and length of the crack in MGB housing of the helicopter PPA- 02 were found similar to that observed in helicopter PPA- 01. Since the fatigue crack origin in both the housings was lost due to surface grinding prior to opening the cracks, inference was drawn from other evidences that fatigue was stress related. The most probable reason for fatigue crack initiation appears to be the high stress concentrations at these locations. Certain design modifications are suggested to reduce the stress concentrations and thereby enhancing the fatigue life of the component...|$|E
40|$|The Cambridge Stereoscan {{electron}} microscope facilitates detailed examination of nematode cuticle. Specimens {{must not be}} covered and all volatile liquid must be removed. The least distorted specimens were those impregnated with anhydrous glycerol or polyethylene glycol (400) the excess of which was drained from the surface before they were mounted and plated with gold/palladium in a vacuum chamber The Cambridge "Stereoscan " {{electron microscope}} scans the outer surface of specimens with a focussed beam of electrons in an evacuated chamber. A signal due to reflected primary electrons and emitted secondaries is collected and used to modulate the brightness of a cathode ray tube scanned in synchronism with the beam (Oatley, Nixon & Pease, 1965). This gives a picture with great depth of focus. The surface of the sample must be electrically conducting to prevent charge build-up due to the electron beam; resolutions down to 200 A. U. can then be achieved in some cases. The specimen holder used has a 12 mm diameter mounting disc of alluminium alloy.
