5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many of his <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the telegraph had resulted in a trail that could be followed for interstate travel, {{but it was a}} haphazard route which only the <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> motorists would take. Many travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services; they would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism. In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see the road as important enough for its involvement.|$|E
5|$|Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney {{developed}} an early interest in drawing. He took art classes {{as a boy}} and {{got a job as}} a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became <b>more</b> <b>adventurous,</b> introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.|$|E

5|$|Headley {{made his}} Jamaica debut against Lord Tennyson's XI at Sabina Park on 9 February 1928, in a match won easily by the home team. Batting at number three, his first innings yielded 16 runs, {{but in the}} second innings, he scored 71, {{reaching}} fifty runs in as many minutes. In the second game against Lord Tennyson's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February, Headley scored his maiden first-class century. Having scored 22 not out after the first day's play, he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> shots. He hit the bowling of Alan Hilder for four consecutive fours and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a row. At one point, thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four. He was finally out for 211, the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team. After the innings, Tennyson compared Headley to Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney, batsmen considered among the best who ever played. Headley concluded the series against Tennyson's team with innings of 40 and 71, {{to give him an}} aggregate of 409 runs at an average of 81.80. He also took his maiden first class wicket.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are {{protected}} by flood doors. These consist of a single pair of mitre gates that are designed to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain. Several of these are navigable to the <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> boater. The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau, which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford. At Antons Gowt, a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains, a system of drainage ditches which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston. Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth, and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils, the Inland Waterways Association, the Environment Agency, Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership.|$|E

5000|$|The work, first {{performed}} in 1858, {{is said to}} be the first classical full-length operetta. [...] Offenbach's earlier operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France did not allow full-length works of certain genres. Orpheus was not only longer, but <b>more</b> musically <b>adventurous</b> than Offenbach's earlier pieces.|$|R

25|$|Duthart pioneered a {{new style}} of pipe band {{drumming}} {{at a time when}} pipe bands were becoming <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> in their musical selections.

50|$|The work is even <b>more</b> harmonically <b>adventurous</b> and contrapuntally {{complex than}} Bartók's {{previous}} two string quartets and explores {{a number of}} extended instrumental techniques, including sul ponticello (playing with the bow {{as close as possible}} to the bridge), col legno (playing with the wood rather than the hair of the bow), and glissandi (sliding from one note to another).|$|R
50|$|Appel is {{generally}} credited for his aggressive tactics in getting Springsteen's career started, although his production abilities {{have often been}} criticized. However, Appel is also sometimes credited with fostering the looser, <b>more</b> musically <b>adventurous</b> and lyrically romantic approach of Springsteen's first two albums. After Landau took over, Springsteen's work became more tightly focused in musical terms and more political in content.|$|R

25|$|The {{choir of}} men and boys sing the {{traditional}} Anglican repertoire as well as <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> fare. The cathedral also possesses a four manual pipe organ, the largest cathedral organ in Australia, which hosts many recitalists from across the world: Pearson's design (and stone-vaulting) creates a five-second reverberation making organ-music particularly resonant.|$|E
25|$|The wing-back role {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{physically}} demanding positions in modern football. Wing-backs are often <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> than traditional full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and then defend effectively against an opponent's attack down the flanks. A defensive midfielder is usually fielded to cover the advances of an opponent's wing-back.|$|E
25|$|Other works include {{keyboard}} canzonas {{in five or}} six voices (perhaps <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> harmonically than Froberger's four voice canzonas and capriccios, but contrapuntally less complex; {{a rarity}} for their time {{because of the number}} of voices) and instrumental pieces (sonatas, canzonas) that feature harmonic experiments in the vein of Valentini's motets. The 1621 chamber music collection, Musica di camera, includes pieces built on ostinato patterns such as the passamezzo, romanesca and ruggiero.|$|E

25|$|Despite Virgin Records' {{disappointment}} {{with the poor}} sales of Rushton's compilation, the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in Europe for both the music and its producers. Ultimately, the release served to distinguish the Detroit sound from Chicago house {{and other forms of}} underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period during which techno became <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> and distinct.|$|E
25|$|The album {{remained}} in the Australian charts for 171 weeks. It retained their live energy but was <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> and radical than previous work. Their ascendancy was signalled {{by a series of}} concerts on the release of the album at Sydney's Capitol Theatre, one of which was filmed and recorded and later released on their 2004 Best of Both Worlds DVD. The band also played their first shows outside Australia during this time, with the album being released in US on Columbia Records, where it charted in 1984 on the Billboard 200; in the UK it was released on CBS.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of guitar-playing gradually improved; the early trovadors, being self-taught, had rather limited techniques. Later, some tapped into classical guitar techniques {{to revive the}} accompaniment of the trova. Guyún (Vincente Gonzalez Rubiera, Stgo de C. 27 October 1908Havana, 1987) studied under Severino Lopez, and developed a modern concept of harmony, {{and a way to}} apply classical technique to popular Cuban music. He became <b>more</b> <b>adventurous,</b> yet still in Cuban vein, and in 1938 stopped performing to devote himself to teaching the guitar. This bore fruit, and two generations of Cuban guitarists bear witness to his influence.|$|E
50|$|With {{the support}} of {{community}} organisations such as the Lions Clubs and The Smith Family, OBA offer several programs {{to the general public}} including one aimed at young adults (Navigator Program), a <b>more</b> physically <b>adventurous</b> course (Pinnacle Program) and a lengthy 26-day adventure course (Summit to Sea) which takes participants from Tharwa in Australia's Capital Territory, to Mount Kosciuszko finally ending up on Victoria's southern coast along the Snowy River.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{his foreign policy}} became <b>more</b> <b>adventurous.</b> At first he sought to gain Russian support to acquire Norway from Denmark. When Catherine the Great refused to abandon her ally Denmark, Gustav {{declared}} war on Russia in June 1788, while it was deeply engaged in a war with the Ottoman Empire to the south. In embarking on a war of aggression {{without the consent of}} the estates, Gustav violated his own constitution of 1772 – which led to a serious mutiny, the Anjala Conspiracy, among his aristocratic officers in Finland. Denmark declared war in support of its Russian ally, but was soon neutralized through British and Prussian diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|This Oamaru Hotel {{is one of}} Lawson's <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> {{forays into}} {{classical}} architecture. Forsaking Palladian-influenced temple-like columns and porticos, he initially took as his inspiration the mannerist palazzi, which were {{a reaction to the}} more ornate high renaissance style of architecture popular in early 16th century Italy. There are even some minor similarities between this building and the Palazzo del Te. Just as at street level the palazzi often have a ground floor of rusticated stone, so did this hotel. Massive blocks of ashlar were used to create an impression of strength, supporting the more delicately designed floor above; this feeling of strength was further enhanced by double pilasters serving merely to imply a need to support the great weight above.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a <b>more</b> <b>adventurous</b> spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E
