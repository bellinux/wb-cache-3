40|$|One of {{the lessons}} {{in the history of}} {{international}} trade in commodities is the emergence - sooner or later - of an international price reference, most commonly known as an international <b>marker</b> <b>price.</b> In the area of oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) plays the role of a marker for sour crudes traded in the Atlantic basin. Brent oil fulfils this function for sweet crudes traded in Europe. Another important aspect in the area of global commodities is that the emergence of a <b>marker</b> <b>price</b> is not always necessarily related to the relative share of production or exports of the commodity, but primarily to the existence of an organized market for this commodity.

40|$|In {{the future}} European energy system, with high {{penetrations}} of uctuating renewable energy generation {{along with the}} increased demand for rapid reduction of fossil-based energy and the growing disinclination towards and phase-out of nuclear-based power, the development of reliable technologies, which can cope with the system's rapidly altering profile becomes increasingly important. In this context, the necessary services to support the transmission of energy through the power network is a potential economic market. While electrofuels are a promising alternative to fossil-based fuels, their production process might prove prosperous in terms of addressing the challenges faced by the modern power systems. This project addresses {{the impact of a}} large-scale employment of this technology on the composition and operation of Swedish power market, where supply of ancillary services is regarded as a potential source of income. In this context, three services, namely reactive power regulation, congestion release, and reserve services in form of demandresponse, have been studied. The possibility of investment {{in each of the four}} Swedish <b>marker</b> <b>price</b> areas with regard to these three ancillary services have been examined. The results for all the three services are in favor of investment in electrofuels, and Sweden's Stockholm area (SE 3) is found to be the most suitable location for large-scale investments in the technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to adapt the classical spot/futures relationship stemming from the theory of storage to the case of the North Sea crude oil market. Brent (and other North Sea crude oil grades) is waterborne and these logistical issues mean that a true spot market for Brent does not exist. As a result, the dated Brent (BFO) price, one of the most widely quoted ‘spot’ crude oil <b>marker</b> <b>prices</b> in the world, is in reality a short-term forward contract price. A new arbitrage relationship is constructed to take account of this and a new formulation for the convenience yield is calculated. Comparison is made with the classical convenience yield in the light of historic price behaviour in both Brent (BFO) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) markets...|$|R
50|$|Triggers are the player's {{primary means}} of {{interacting}} with the marker. The amount of force required to fire the marker, {{as well as the}} distance the trigger travels before actuating, called the throw, has a marked effect upon the player's ability to achieve high rates of fire. Many <b>markers,</b> especially higher <b>priced</b> <b>markers,</b> use electronic trigger frames with a variety of sensing methods, including micro-switches, hall effect sensors or break-beam infra-red switches. These triggers have short throws, allowing a high rate of fire. Non-electronic markers sometimes use carefully set pneumatic to achieve a light and short trigger pull.|$|R

40|$|Mechanization {{no longer}} {{appears to be}} a {{priority}} in agricultural development strategies in Africa, although 60 % of farm work is still carried our manually. Mechanization has had a bad press. Only the failures of experiments and past projects are seen, highlighted by pictures of fleers of rusting equipment; the successes are forgotten. Mechanizarion is also accused, rightly or wrongly, of destroying the land or creating unemployment in the rural environment. However, mechanization can increase farm productivity and hence profirabiliry: the main aim of a mechanization policy should be to enhance economic efficiency. But mechanization is only one factor in agricultural production, since its effectiveness depends on the use made of other factors (fertilizer, seed, pesticide, irrigation erc.) : mechanization is nor an end in itself, but is one of the means of improving agriculture. Mechanizarion policies must have two main characteristics in order to be long-laying: one physical, the other economic. Firstly, the development of mechanization is practical only if it does nor degrade natural resources (vegetation, soil, water sources) which constitute the farmer's heritage. Secondly, mechanization is practical economically only if farmers can buy, maintain and replace equipment at <b>marker</b> <b>prices.</b> The Committee for Regional Agricultural Information Programmes and Srraregies (CRAIPS) for agricultural information activities in Central Africa has requested CTA to address this important issue in agricultural development. In response CTA has commissioned a study to identify appropriate means of increasing the awareness of the various people involved, (farmers, political decision-makers. national and regional insrirutiolls) about the contribution which mechanization can make to agricultural development in Africa. National and regional strategies for agricultural mechanization will be proposed, with particular reference to small and medium-sized farms.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{for the stock market}} volatility, considered as a <b>marker</b> of inefficient <b>pricing</b> of stock shares and insufficient functionality of the financial markets, has increased during the recent years. This is evidenced by the increasingly risky nature of stock investments and the stock market due to the increase in volatility of the stock prices. The objective {{of this study is to}} model and analyze stock return volatility for BIST- 100. To fulfill that objective, stock return volatility for BIST- 100 1997 : 01 – 2015 : 03 period was modeled using ARCH, GARCH, EGARCH and TARCH models. It was concluded that the most suitable model for BIST- 100 return series was the EGARCH (1, 1). Results demonstrated that while the leverage effect was significant for BIST- 100, negative news that affect the markets also increase the volatility. Another finding showed that BIST- 100 volatility demonstrated continuity...|$|R
40|$|Within a {{woody plant}} species, {{environmental}} heterogeneity {{has the potential}} to influence the distribution of genetic variation among populations through several evolutionary processes. In some species, a relationship between environmental characteristics and the distribution of genotypes can be detected, showing the importance of natural selection as the main source of differentiation. Nothofagus dombeyi (Mirb.) Oerst. (Nothofagaceae) is an endemic tree species occurring both in Chile and in Argentina temperate forests. Postglacial history has been studied with chloroplast DNA and evolutionary forces shaping genetic variation patterns have been analysed with isozymes but fine-scale genetic diversity studies are needed. The study of demographic and selection histories in Nothofagus dombeyi requires more informative markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Genotyping-by-Sequencing tools now allow studying thousands of SNP <b>markers</b> at reasonable <b>prices</b> in nonmodel species. We investigated more than 10 [*]K SNP loci for signatures of local adaptation and showed that interrogation of genomic resources can identify shifts in genetic diversity and putative adaptive signals in this nonmodel woody species...|$|R
30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) is an {{important}} agronomic crop, also a model monocot plant. The recent completion of the whole genome sequence and the genetic tools available for rice, such as <b>marker</b> maps (<b>Price</b> et al. 2002; International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005; Salunkhe et al. 2011), proteomic analysis (Rabello et al. 2008; Choudhary et al. 2009; Degenkolbe et al. 2013), and microarrays (Rabbani et al. 2003; Rensink and Buell 2005; Degenkolbe et al. 2009, Degenkolbe et al. 2013), are advantages to researchers who are studying the drought tolerance of this plant. Microarray technology {{has been applied to}} profile gene expression in response to abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, cold, or ABA treatments in several model plants including Arabidopsis and rice (Kreps et al. 2002; Seki et al. 2002; Rabbani et al. 2003; Lenka et al. 2011). When microarray technology was initially applied, individual gene expression related to abiotic stress was more or less of interest. Rabbani et al. (2003) analyzed stress-inducible genes in rice using a microarray containing approximately 1700 rice cDNAs. A total of 73 genes were reported as stress-inducible, including 58 novel unreported genes in rice. Among them, 36, 62, 57, and 43 genes were induced by cold, drought, high salinity, and ABA; respectively. The gene expression profile of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice cultivars that were treated for 18  days of drought stress in climate chamber was also surveyed with the 20  K NSF oligonucleotide microarray (Degenkolbe et al. 2009). Localizing all expressed genes on the rice genome map, genes with significant genotype × environment (G × E) interaction co-localized with quantitative trait loci regions for drought tolerance. Microarray analysis was also utilized to profile genome expression changes in rice organs such as shoot, flag leaf, and panicle under drought or high-salinity conditions (Zhou et al. 2007). Patterns of gene expression in response to drought or high-salinity stress showed significant overlap within a particular organ type and unique patterns among different organs.|$|R
40|$|Dubai {{became the}} main <b>price</b> <b>marker</b> for the Gulf region by default {{in the mid}} 1980 s, when {{it was one of}} the few Gulf crudes {{available}} for sale on the spot market. Also, until very recently, Dubai allowed oil companies to own equity in Dubai production – unlike other countries in the Gulf such as Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. When the Dubai market first emerged, few trading companies participated in it, with little volume of trading taking place. This, however, changed during the period 1985 – 87 when many Japanese trading houses and Wall Street refiners started entering the market. But the major impetus came in 1988 when key OPEC countries abandoned the administered pricing system and started pricing their crude export to Asia on the basis of Dubai crude. Over a short period of time, Dubai became responsible for pricing millions of barrels on a daily basis, and the Dubai market became known as the ‘Brent of the East’. Despite the existence of other regional crudes with a much larger physical base, more than 25 years have now passed, and most cargoes from the Gulf destined for Asia are still priced against Dubai or Oman or a combination of these crudes. Nevertheless, the nature of the Dubai benchmark has evolved and many of the institutional and pricing details have witnessed major transformations, driven in large part by the decline in Dubai’s oil production and innovations in the pricing mechanisms introduced in the 2000 s. Perhaps what remains from the 1980 s pricing system is just the brand name ‘Dubai’. </p...|$|R

Predvsem podjetja morajo slednje dobro poznati, saj morajo vnaprej predvideti, v katero smer bo šel razvoj. Zagotavljati morajo zadostne količine dobrin, ki so jih potrošniki pripravljeni kupiti in bi jih s primernim trženjem tudi kupili. Opredelili smo različne oblike in vloge potrošnika pri nakupovanju, opisali smo proces nakupnega odločanja in posamezne dejavnike, ki nanj vplivajo. Ti so: izdelek in njegova kakovost, blagovna znamka, somatski markerji, cena, pomen in pomembnost oglaševanja ter trženja, slovenski nacionalni karakter kot marketinški dejavnik, puščanje odprtih možnosti, vpliv okolja in modne muhe, poreklo izdelka, prodajno mesto ter ponakupne aktivnosti. Opredelili smo tudi dejavnike, ki na samo potrošnjo vplivajo negativno. S pomočjo opredeljenih dejavnikov v teoretičnem delu smo sestavili anketni vprašalnik, s katerim smo preverili, kateri izmed posameznih dejavnikov imajo na potrošnike največji oziroma najmanjši vpliv.
