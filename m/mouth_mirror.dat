AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : This study describes and compares the incidence and status of dental caries and the number and type of oral mucosal lesions in hospital outpatients with these data in institutionalized children who had accepted a dedicated oral and dental management programme for HIV-infected patients. DESIGN : This was a retrospective, descriptive cross-sectional study in which existing medical records were reviewed and a clinical examination performed. METHODS : The oral cavity of each patient was examined by two calibrated clinicians who used <b>mouth</b> <b>mirrors</b> under artificial light.

50|$|PMVr or F5 {{is often}} studied {{with respect to}} its {{role in shaping the}} hand during {{grasping}} and in interactions between the hand and the <b>mouth.</b> <b>Mirror</b> neurons were first discovered in area F5 in the monkey brain by Rizzolatti and colleagues. These neurons are active when the monkey grasps an object. Yet the same neurons become active when the monkey watches an experimenter grasp an object in the same way. The neurons are therefore both sensory and motor. Mirror neurons are proposed to be a basis for understanding the actions of others by internally imitating the actions using one's own motor control circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Two sets of {{evidence}} suggest that mirror neurons in the monkey {{have a role}} in action understanding. First, the activation of mirror neurons requires biological effectors such as hand or <b>mouth.</b> <b>Mirror</b> neurons do not respond to the action with tools like pliers. Mirror neurons respond to neither the sight of an object alone nor an action without an object (intransitive action). Umilta and colleagues [...] demonstrated that a subset of mirror neurons fired when final critical part of the action was not visible to the observer. The experimenter showed his hand moving toward a cube and grasping it, and later showed the same action without showing later part grasping the cube (placing the cube behind the occluder). Mirror neurons fired on both visible and invisible conditions. On the other hand, mirror neurons did not discharge when the observer knew that there was not a cube behind the occluder.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dental caries is a {{multifactorial disease}} with varying {{clinical}} picture and its diagnostic criteria is complicated, when initial lesion is considered. Hence, {{there is a}} need for an index which measures cavitated, non-cavitated, and initial lesion in dental caries. So, the purpose of this study was to compare the of def index with Nyvad′s new diagnostic criteria. Materials and Methods: A total of 249 school children in the age group of three to six years were selected for the study from Sajjan Rao School at Bangalore city. Children teeth were cleaned and dried with cotton rolls and chip blower. The dental caries examinations were conducted under standardized conditions using plane <b>mouth</b> <b>mirrors</b> and explorers with the help of artificial illumination.

The instruments were divided into two groups - Group I with oral rinse-set A (0. 01 % chlorhexidine gluconate) and set B (0. 025 % betadine) and Group II (included sets C and D without oral rinse). The instruments of set A, B and C were microwaved at 2, 450 MHz, 800 W for 5 min, whereas, set D was microwaved for 10 min at the same above mentioned specifications.

40|$|Background: Detection and {{evaluation}} of dental caries is of epidemiological importance. Its early detection is important to commence appropriate treatment planning.

Objectives: The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the caries experience in schoolchildren using decayed-missing-filled teeth (DMFT) /decayed-extracted-filled teeth (deft), International Caries Detection and Assessment System-II (ICDAS-II), and Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment (CAST) systems. Materials and Methods: An epidemiological survey was carried out among 1550 schoolchildren (37, 644 teeth) between the age ranges of 4 and 14 years. American Dental Association type III examination was performed using plane <b>mouth</b> <b>mirrors</b> and community periodontal index probes using DMFT/deft, ICDAS II, and CAST indices. Results: Out of 37, 644 teeth examined, 2, 718 teeth had shown caries. Caries experience with DMFT/deft index was 5. 54 %. Highest score of DMFT was observed in deciduous dentition period (59. 02 %).

The agonising fact is that despite several efforts towards total eradication, dental caries is still prevalent. As the prevalence of dental caries is very high among school children {{and there is a}} paucity of such data in Coimbatore and the literature review does not reveal many such studies from this area, the study was conducted in the school going children in Sulur.

Aims: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess dentition status and treatment needs, oral hygiene status, and traumatic dental injuries among institutionalized children attending special schools for the visually impaired in eastern Odisha.
