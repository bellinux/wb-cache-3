5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of <b>memory</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|E

25|$|I/O {{addresses}} are for {{compatibility with}} the Intel x86 architecture's I/O port address space. Although the PCI bus specification allows burst transactions in any address space, most devices only support it for <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> and not I/O.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of these definitions, a byte is the {{smallest}} primitive; each <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> specifies a different byte. The <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> of the initial byte of a datum is considered the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> (or base <b>memory</b> <b>address)</b> of the entire datum.|$|R

25|$|Visualising <b>memory</b> <b>{{addresses}}</b> {{from left}} to right makes little-endian values appear backwards. If the addresses are written increasing towards the left instead, each individual little-endian value will appear forwards. However strings of values or characters appear reversed instead.|$|E
25|$|A buffer {{overflow}} occurs when data written to a buffer also corrupts data values in <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> {{adjacent to the}} destination buffer due to insufficient bounds checking. This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.|$|E
25|$|More {{recently}} {{deep learning}} {{was shown to}} be useful in semantic hashing where a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors is obtained from a large document set. Documents are mapped to <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> {{in such a way}} that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing other nearby addresses.|$|E

50|$|The source operand can {{be either}} an XMM {{register}} (xmm) or a <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> (m64). When the source operand is an XMM register, the destination operand must be a <b>memory</b> <b>address.</b> When the source operand is a <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> the destination operand must be an XMM register.|$|R

25|$|Randomization of {{the virtual}} <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> at which {{functions}} and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, but not impossible. It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of internet worms. A similar but less effective method is to rebase processes and libraries in the virtual address space.|$|E
25|$|We {{can assume}} that as we write text left to right, we are {{increasing}} the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> âˆ’ as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E
25|$|Approaches that {{represent}} previous experiences directly {{and use a}} similar experience to form a local model are often called nearest neighbour or k-nearest neighbors methods. Deep learning is useful in semantic hashing where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. Documents are mapped to <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> {{in such a way}} that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. Unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1000-bit addresses, semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture.|$|E
50|$|This {{evolutionary}} implementation (repeated in z/Architecture) had {{the characteristic}} {{of solving the}} most urgent problems first: relief for real <b>memory</b> <b>addressing</b> being needed sooner than virtual <b>memory</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In paging the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> {{space is}} divided into equal-sized blocks called pages. Using virtual memory hardware, each page can reside in any {{location}} of the computer's physical memory, or be flagged as being protected. Virtual memory {{makes it possible to}} have a linear virtual <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> space and to use it to access blocks fragmented over physical <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> space.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{instruction}} on line 3 has a RAW {{dependence on the}} [...] {{instruction on}} line 2, and the [...] instruction on line 5 has a RAW dependence on the [...] instruction on line 4. Both load instructions read the <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> that the preceding stores wrote. The stores were the most recent producers to that <b>memory</b> <b>address,</b> and the loads are reading that <b>memory</b> <b>address's</b> value.|$|R
25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} {{compatibility with}} older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained {{part of the}} PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 286 processor, which could address up to 16 MB of memory in Protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained {{as long as the}} 286 was running in Real mode, since DOS required Real mode which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in Real mode such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, because they have no awareness of physical <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of available RAM addresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special <b>memory</b> <b>addresses</b> which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|E
5000|$|An IOMMU {{also allows}} {{operating}} systems to eliminate bounce buffers needed to {{allow themselves to}} communicate with peripheral devices whose <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> spaces are smaller than the operating system's <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> space, by using <b>memory</b> <b>address</b> translation. At the same time, an IOMMU also allows operating systems and hypervisors to prevent buggy or malicious hardware from compromising memory security. Both AMD and Intel have released their IOMMU specifications: ...|$|R
