500|$|Dean and Knapp {{write that}} the theatre's history was [...] "enlivened and envenomed by a <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> controversy, pursued in pamphlets, broadsheets, sermons and prefaces to librettos... and by {{financial}} crises which persisted {{on and off}} throughout the sixty years of its existence". A preponderance of biblically inspired works in the earliest years was soon replaced by a range of more secular subjects, often drawn from Roman history and myth, or from recent {{events such as the}} 1683 siege of Vienna. [...] Performances tended to be of considerable length, often extending to six hours. [...] The 18-year-old Handel entered this hectic environment in mid-1703, to take up a place in the theatre's orchestra as a ripieno (ensemble) second violin.|$|E
500|$|In January 1646, amid ongoing peace negotiations, Charles {{attempted}} {{to separate the}} Independents from other factions by proposing in letters to Vane an alliance with his faction against the Presbyterians. [...] Vane was not amused by this, and responded {{by pointing out that}} he preferred the rights of [...] "tender consciences" [...] to be granted by Parliament than by the duplicitous king (papers exposing the king's negotiating positions as facades had been captured at Naseby, and had largely silenced the Royalist elements in Parliament). [...] The Vane estates were not spared in the <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> war; Vane's father reported that Raby Castle had been [...] "visited four times", suffering damages of £16,000. [...] In September 1645, the Vanes succeeded in getting Parliamentary approval to fortify Raby.|$|E
500|$|... "Bang Bang" [...] {{received}} a positive reception from critics on its release. Gigwise praised it saying: [...] "The song is Green Day at their punky best. It's far {{more in line}} with the intensity of stuff on Dookie than the ballads on American Idiot". Thomas Smith at NME observed: [...] "Musically, it's classic Green Day; limited power chords used to furious effect, a <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> abrasive punk rock that's aided by Mike Dirnt's rumbling bass and Tré Cool's on-point drumming. On this evidence, Green Day {{have found a way to}} stay relevant." [...] Joseph R. Atilano, of Inquirer.net, concurred and said the song [...] "does not sound 'glossy', 'too clean cut around the edges' nor overly polished". He added that it [...] "sounds aesthetically right," [...] especially for those who [...] "want to hear the 'Green Day of old' once more".|$|E

Although Maelstrom sometimes treated Deathurge {{as if he were}} a lackey, Deathurge served only at Oblivions behest, for Oblivion perceived within Maelstrom the potential to drastically tip the scales between existence and non-existence in his favor.|$|R

It {{must have been the}} wind--the heat before the fire. He seemed to see through it, but there was nothing beyond, only opaque, dim, mustering clouds. Hot puffs shot forward into his face. His eyes smarted and stung. His ears hurt and were growing deaf. The tumult was the rear <b>of</b> avalanches, <b>of</b> <b>maelstroms,</b> <b>of</b> rushing seas, of the wreck of the uplands and the ruin of the earth. It grew to be so great a roar that he no longer heard. There was only silence.|$|R
500|$|From Maiorescu, Filitti {{borrowed}} the essential sociological concept of [...] "forms without content", criticizing all modernization {{which did not}} take into account local realities, writing: [...] "After seven decades of bourgeois forms, without a bourgeoisie, with all that <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> laws and regulations, which has grown to cover 20,000 pages , the tally shows that [...] the villages of all places have registered no profit, although [...] Romania is, at heart, nothing but one giant village." [...] In his post-Junimist studies, Filitti angrily noted that the PNL regime had only increased the ranks of the bureaucracy (and implicitly enlarged their political machine), perpetuating etatism. He proposed measures to counter this trend by encouraging a [...] "rural bourgeoisie", [...] "self-reliant", determined to reemerge [...] "from the darkness and routine" [...] of country life, and, in time, capable of supporting a national industry.|$|E

[...] Other reviewers felt the effects were not outstanding; IGN's Erik Brudvig said the explosions looked like [...] "bloody snot". [...] Finding the <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> color contrails distracting, Justin Hoeger wrote in his article for The Sacramento Bee that he was dogfighting [...] "garish, neon-colored contrails" [...] instead of enemy fighters, a sentiment shared by several others.

50|$|For many centuries, the Norwegian Sea was {{regarded}} as {{the edge of the}} known world. The disappearance of ships there, due to the natural disasters, induced legends of monsters that stopped and sank ships (kraken). As late as in 1845, the Encyclopædia metropolitana contained a multi-page review by Erik Pontoppidan (1698-1764) on ship-sinking sea monsters half a mile in size. Many legends might be based on the work Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus of 1539 by Olaus Magnus, which described the kraken and <b>maelstroms</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian Sea. The kraken also appears in Alfred Tennyson's poem of the same name, in Herman Melville's Moby Dick, and in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne.|$|R

500|$|Meyszner {{arrived in}} Belgrade in late January 1942, {{inserted}} {{into a political}} <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> conflicting lines of command and authority. Even the military lines of command were confusing. One branch of the military staff {{was responsible for the}} administration of the occupied territory and another was responsible for military operations against the insurgents. A few weeks after Meyszner's arrival, the two military positions were finally combined into the Commanding General and Military Commander in Serbia, in the person of General der Artillerie (Lieutenant general) Paul Bader, who had previously been the Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia. Bader reported to the Wehrmacht Commander in South-East Europe, General der Pioniere (Lieutenant general) Walter Kuntze, who reported directly to Hitler. The military chain of command considered Meyszner's appointment [...] "a very peremptory organisational change". Kuntze's chief of staff described Meyszner as one [...] "for whom we did not ask".|$|E
500|$|Along with Davis' other 1970s records, Dark Magus was {{received}} ambivalently by contemporary critics but became {{an inspiration to}} late 1970s noise rock acts and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s. Its 1997 reissue was ranked by Christgau as the 10th best {{album of the year}} in his list for The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. In 2001, Q named it one of the [...] "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time" [...] and called it [...] "a <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> uncut improvisational fury... arguably the furthest out Miles ever got". David Keenan placed it on his all-time 105 best albums list for the Sunday Herald and said by ornamenting heavy grooves with tribal percussive instruments, wah-wah effects, and otherworldly trumpet bursts, Davis had instinctively fused the most advanced elements of modern African-American music. According to CODA critic Greg Masters, Davis created among the most darkest and radical auras, feelings, and moods in 20th-century music on Dark Magus.|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} to A Weekend in the City was mixed, but generally positive; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 65% based on 30critical reviews. Louis Pattison of NME described the album as [...] "tender and reflective, edgy and embittered; {{a difficult and}} emotional beast that jolts with nervous electricity" [...] and pointed out that its notable achievement is that it finds moments of genuine contentment amidst [...] "a <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> anger and confusion". Allmusic's Heather Phares did not find the album as immediate as Bloc Party's earlier work, but noted that [...] "its gradual move from alienation to connection and hope is just as bold as Silent Alarm, and possibly even more resonant". Drowned in Sound's Mike Diver called it [...] "dirty, dishevelled, unsure and paranoid; fearful, easily distracted, boisterous and ashamed; reckless, wild, nervous and terrified; graceful, thought-provoking, clumsy and contradictory... and very nearly perfect." [...] Jeff Miller of the Chicago Tribune concluded, [...] "For Bloc Party, Silent Alarm was a baby step {{and this is a}} giant leap." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{work under}} review is the twelfth volume {{in the series}} ‘Languages of the Greater Himalayan Region’.

The Order of the Twin Adder, Gridania's Grand Company, is led by Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna, an even-headed child of the forest who is blessed with the power of prophecy. Ul'dah's Immortal Flames are led by Flame General Raubahn Aldynn, a Highlander from Ala Mhigo and bodyguard of reigning sultana Nanamo Ul Namo. Raubahn climbed out of poverty through his martial skill while fighting in the Coliseum. The <b>Maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> Limsa Lominsa is led by Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, a cunning former pirate who instituted a harsh conscription service to bring the pirate fleets under her command.

500|$|Noé {{initially}} {{asked the}} Daft Punk member Thomas Bangalter, who had composed {{the music for}} Irréversible, to create an original soundtrack for Enter the Void. Bangalter was occupied with work on [...] and had to decline. As a compromise, he provided Noé with an arrangement of ambient sounds and samples from existing experimental music, from which Noé compiled what he envisioned as [...] "a <b>maelstrom</b> <b>of</b> sounds." [...] Bangalter is billed in the credits as sound effects director, and the film features his track [...] "Désaccords" [...] originally composed for Irréversible. One {{of the sources of}} inspiration for the soundtrack was [...] "Revolution 9" [...] by The Beatles, a sound collage which Noé describes as a work [...] "where you catch the beginning of a note, or of a melody and then it's already somewhere else." [...] The two main musical themes of the film are [...] "Freak" [...] by the British electro artist LFO, which is played during the opening credits, and a recording by Delia Derbyshire of Johann Sebastian Bach's [...] "Air on the G String", which serves as the theme for Oscar's childhood and his relationship with Linda. The beginning of [...] "ANS" [...] by the British band Coil is heard during Oscar's first DMT trip. The Throbbing Gristle song [...] "Hamburger Lady" [...] plays as Oscar tries to deliver drugs to Victor at the bar.
