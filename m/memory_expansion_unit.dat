50|$|The 5161 was an {{expansion}} chassis that used an identical case and power supply as the XT but had {{instead of a}} system board a backplane with 8 card slots (and no microprocessor). The 5161 came with a 10 MB hard drive and had room for another one. The 5161 {{was connected to the}} 5160 using an Extender Card in the system unit and a Receiver Card in the <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit,</b> connected by a custom cable. The <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit</b> could also contain extra memory, but the Extender card inserted wait states for <b>memory</b> in the <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit,</b> so it was preferable to install memory onto the XT system board or on memory cards in slots plugged into the XT system board directly. The 5161 could be connected to either an XT or to the earlier 5150 (the original IBM PC). This expansion feature was not available for later machines like the IBM PC AT and in fact the 5161 is completely incompatible with anything but an 8088-based PC.|$|R

40|$|The ITER {{electron}} cyclotron heating {{transmission lines}} {{will consist of}} 63. 5 -mm-diameter corrugated waveguides, each carrying 1 MW of 170 GHz microwaves. These transmission lines must include <b>expansion</b> <b>units</b> to accommodate <b>expansion</b> and contraction along the path from the gyrotron microwave sources to the tokamak. A numerical mode matching code has been developed to calculate power losses due to mode conversion of the operating mode, HE 11, to higher order modes {{as a result of}} the radial discontinuities in a sliding joint. Two <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> designs were evaluated, a simple gap <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> and a more complex tapered <b>expansion</b> <b>unit.</b> The gap <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> demonstrated loss that oscillated rapidly with expansion length, due to trapped modes within the <b>unit.</b> The tapered <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> has been shown to effectively suppress these trapped modes at the expense of increased fabrication complexity. In a gap <b>expansion</b> <b>unit,</b> for a waveguide step size of 2. 5 mm, loss can be kept below 0. 1 % to a maximum expansion length of 17 mm. <b>Expansion</b> <b>units</b> without corrugation on interior walls were also evaluated. <b>Expansion</b> <b>units</b> that lack corrugations are found to increase mode trapping within the units, though not beyond useful application. The mode matching code developed in this paper was also used to estimate mode conversion loss in vacuum pumpouts for the ECH lines; the estimated loss was found to be negligibly small. United States.
