5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, {{when it was}} replaced by a <b>Mark</b> 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by a <b>Mark</b> 3 main armament fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two <b>Mark</b> 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two <b>Mark</b> 3s and three <b>Mark</b> 4 secondary armament.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a <b>Mark</b> 38 main battery fire control system with <b>Mark</b> 13 and 27 radars, a <b>Mark</b> 37 secondary battery fire control system with <b>Mark</b> 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a <b>Mark</b> 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a <b>Mark</b> 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|By November 1942, North Carolina had an {{additional}} <b>Mark</b> 4 and a SG surface search radar added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and <b>Mark</b> 8s to direct its main battery. All of the <b>Mark</b> 4s remained for the secondary battery, {{and one of}} the older <b>Mark</b> 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the <b>Mark</b> 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and <b>Mark</b> 12s and 22s superseded the <b>Mark</b> 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades.|$|E
