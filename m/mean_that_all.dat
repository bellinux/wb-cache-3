5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test {{to determine if a}} differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific {{to just a few}} engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the entire class was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Congress was {{dominated}} by southern Congressmen, as apportionment was based on three-fifths {{of the number of}} slaves being counted in population totals. They passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> states welcomed free blacks. For instance, Indiana, whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver {{some of it}} less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger cracking pressure to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the interstage pressure decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, {{in at least one}} regulator design, once the interstage pressure has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the residual gas to escape until the cylinder pressure has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} the radical tendency is {{a variant of}} liberalism. Sometimes it is less doctrinaire and more moderate; other times it is more extreme. In Victorian era Britain the Radicals {{were part of the}} Liberal coalition, but often rebelled when the more traditional Whigs in that coalition resisted democratic reforms. In other countries, these left-wing liberals have formed their own radical parties with various names, e.g. in Switzerland and Germany (Freisinn), Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands but also Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Chile and Paraguay. This does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> radical parties were formed by left-wing liberals. In the French political literature it is normal to make a clear separation between liberalism and radicalism in France. In Serbia both radicalism and liberalism have had their distinctiveness during the 19th century, with the Radical Party being the dominant political party throughout the entire multi-parliamentary period before the unification of Yugoslavia. It had cracked in 1903 when the Independent Radical Party had left, leaving the old People's Radical Party straying far from liberalism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. The Independents had created the Democratic Party, whereas the Radicals of today are a far-right political group.|$|E

25|$|Adam Air {{is being}} sued by Indonesian {{consumer}} and labour groups over the accident, {{for a total}} of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid {{to the families of the}} victims. According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder control valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s. They have explained that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the rudder control valves.|$|E
500|$|In construing {{the concept}} of {{equality}} in Article 12, the Court held that equality does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Chief Justice Yong Pung How arrived at this conclusion by considering the history that underpinned the notion of equality. The Court traced the origin of Article 12 back to the 40th article of the Magna Carta which reads, [...] "To none will we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we delay right or justice." ...|$|E

[...] The title is also based on gambling terminology that would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> love is a risk.|$|E
