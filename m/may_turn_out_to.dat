5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E

25|$|The social {{stigma of}} the drug also {{complicated}} studies of PCE; researchers labored under the awareness that their findings would have political implications.

25|$|One {{reason for}} the drop {{in public and private}} {{investment}} in research is the economic slowdown. After peaking at 7.5% annual growth in 2010, the economy slowed before dipping into recession in 2015 (-3.7% growth). The government has been forced to adopt austerity measures and is now less able to collect revenue through the sectorial funds, since company profits are down in many quarters. Industrial output declined by 2.8% between November and December 2014 and by 3.2% over the entire year. The most recent data indicate that 2014–2015 <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the worst years in decades for industry, especially for the transformation subsector of the manufacturing industry’.|$|E
25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else is willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E

On 28 February 2008, Sony made a similar announcement, of impending sale to a consortium led by American investment banking giant (now bank holding company) Morgan Stanley. Both deals were finalised {{by the end of}} March 2008. Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they might have found much harder to sell at a later date, just when they needed the cash the most.|$|E

Van Morrison's exploration of spirituality is discussed in the book, including his experiences with mysticism, Christianity, and Dianetics.

500|$|Despite the {{designation}} [...] "possible", {{someone with a}} visceral AVM and a family history but no nosebleeds or telangiectasias is still extremely likely to have HHT, because these AVMs are very uncommon in the general population. At the same time, the same cannot be said of nosebleeds and sparse telangiectasias, both of which occur in people without HHT, {{in the absence of}} AVMs. Someone's diagnostic status may change in the course of life, as young children may not yet exhibit all the symptoms; at age 16, thirteen percent are still indeterminate, while at age 60 the vast majority (99%) have a definite diagnostic classification.

The threat to push b2–b4 must be taken seriously by Black, who typically answers 6...a5. But in the 1980s {{it was discovered that}} the push a7–a5 was actually a very useful one for Black, as it allows the Ra8 to be developed along the sixth rank. Meanwhile, the push a2–a3 is less useful for White, as he {{will not be able to}} easily push b2–b4. As Tseitlin puts it, [...] "the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside, whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it".
