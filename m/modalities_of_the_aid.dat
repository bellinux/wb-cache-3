The paper goes on to explore how current initiatives to improve aid transparency can best support better budgets and accountability in aid dependent countries. These efforts provide an important opportunity to enhance <b>the</b> effec-tiveness <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> recipient governments’ own spending and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> they receive from donors. Research related to this paper has been funded by the International Budget Partnership and Publish What You Fund, with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> informing and influencing <b>the</b> International <b>Aid</b> Transparency Initiative (IATI) – an ongoing proc-ess to build an international standard for aid information as a follow on from the resolutions in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. Why are budgets important in <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>aid?</b> A large proportion of aid to developing coun-tries is provided to, and spent by, <b>the</b> govern-ments <b>of</b> those countries – whether in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> budget support, projects or other <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> importance <b>of</b> delivering <b>aid</b> through government systems has been emphasised and formalised through the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action. Budgets are the link between policies and their implementation, between political visions or programmes and their delivery, allocating resources {{both in terms of}} money and time to plans. A typical government implements policies through its departments, agencies and local governments. These institutions, and their managers, are accountable to the political leadership. Politicians, in turn, are account-able to the citizenry for <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> national policies for health care and education, for example. If this cycle of accountability is not carefully observed and supported in <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> {{it is likely to be}} undermine...|$|R

This study was done in frame of survey research model. <b>The</b> subjects <b>of</b> this study were 642 sixth grade students and their 20 English teachers who were working at fifteen different primary schools in <b>the</b> central district <b>of</b> Edirne in 2010 - 2011 academic year. In order to determine <b>the</b> learning <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and the teachers, Grasha-Riechmann Learning Styles Inventory; and for <b>the</b> teaching <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers Grasha Teaching Styles Inventory was used. Both scales were adapted to Turkish by the researcher. The obtained data were analyzed in the SPSS package program. To analyze the data collected, frequency, percentage, mean values were calculated and the independent t- test, one-way ANOVA and correlation tests were used. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study indicated that i) the students’ collaborative and participant learning modalities are more dominant than the other learning modalities, ii) gender {{is an important factor}} for avoidant, collaborative, dependent and participant learning modalities, iii) socio-economic status is not an important factor affecting the learning modalities, iv) students’ report card marks are determining factor for just the avoidant, dependent and participant learning modalities. When <b>the</b> learning <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers were investigated, it was revealed that teachers’ participant and dependent learning modalities are more dominant than <b>the</b> learning <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> collaborative, competitive, independent and avoidant.

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{literature}} compares various biometric <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{face for}} human identification. The common criterion used for comparison is <b>the</b> recognition rate <b>of</b> different face <b>modalities</b> {{using the same}} recognition algorithms. Such comparisons are not completely unbiased as the same recognition algorithm or features may not be suitable for every <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face. Moreover, an important aspect which is overlooked in these comparisons is <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> variation present in each modality which will ultimately effect the database size each modality can handle. This paper presents such a comparison between the most common biometric <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face namely visible, thermal infrared and range images. Experiments are performed on the Equinox and the FRGC databases with results indicating that visible images capture more interpersonal variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human face compared to thermal IR and range images. We conclude that under controlled conditions, visible face images have a greater potential of accommodating large databases compared to long-wave IR and range images. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether anticipatory attention - i. e. attention {{directed towards}} an upcoming stimulus {{in order to}} facilitate its processing - is realized at the neurophysiological level by a pre-stimulus desynchronization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensory cortex corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticipated stimulus, reflecting then opening of a thalamocortical gate in the relevant sensory modality. It is argued that a technique called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) of rhythmic 10 -Hz activity is well suited to study the thalamocortical processes that are thought to mediate anticipatory attention. In a series of experiments, ERD was computed on EEG and MEG data, recorded while subjects performed a time estimation task and were informed about <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> their time estimation by stimuli providing Knowledge <b>of</b> Results (KR). <b>The</b> <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KR stimuli (auditory, visual, or somatosensory) was manipulated both within and between experiments. The results indicate to varying degrees that preceding <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KR stimuli, ERD is present over the sensory cortex, which corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KR stimulus. <b>The</b> general pattern <b>of</b> results supports <b>the</b> notion that a thalamocortical gating mechanism forms <b>the</b> neurophysiological basis <b>of</b> anticipatory attention. Furthermore, the results support the notion that Event-Related Potential(ERP) and ERD measures reflect fundamentally different neurophysiological processes...|$|R

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed.
