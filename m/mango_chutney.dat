25|$|The roti wrap is {{the commercialization}} of roti and curry {{together}} as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin and spinach as well a variety of local condiments; pepper sauce (hot sauce) and <b>mango</b> <b>chutney</b> being the most popular.|$|E

2500|$|Another item {{prepared}} like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake {{seems to}} be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes {{from other parts of the}} West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs ("western" [...] style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies including Trinidad, Barbados and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a [...] "bake and shark" [...] is a popular street food sandwich in which fried shark is sandwiched between two halves of a sliced bake with a plethora of local condiments. Pepper sauce, shado beni, garlic sauce, tamarind and <b>mango</b> <b>chutney</b> are most common as well as lettuce, tomato and cucumber for fillers.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{literature}} review {{that aims to}} describe marketing contexts for mango production in Kenya. The institutional conditions {{in the country are}} not well developed for marketing purposes, which causes many difficulties and problems for the society. In Kenya most mango producers are poor small-scale farmers with limited resources. Mango is a perishable commodity and to keep its value and quality it is essential {{to have the opportunity to}} sell the mangos in the right time. Inefficient and undeveloped infrastructure and marketing systems hinders the mangos to reach the market in time though, which causes large losses of produce. The Kenyan mango production has increased during the last decade but due to market losses for the producer, the small-scale farmers‟ profits have not improved. The farmers' margins are low and losses of profit and produce strikes them hard. An important factor in the mango farmer's context is corruption. Kenya is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and the corruption highly affects the situation for the small-scale farmer negatively. There is great potential to reduce poverty in Kenya by for example improving the mango production and sales of mango. One possibility to keep the mango's quality is to process the fruit and by that add value. Examples of processed <b>mango</b> products are <b>chutney,</b> dried fruits, and juice. Marketing strategies always need to be adapted to the specific situation and context. A possible marketing strategy suitable for the Kenyan context is perceived in the opportunity for small-scale farmers organizing into cooperatives. In such cooperatives financial resources and knowledge are gathered, which improves the opportunities, power and influence for the farmers'. By using a Base of the Pyramid (BOP) perspective in marketing, where the basis for all business activities is to develop among the poorest of the poor, new opportunities and solutions are shaped for their reality. Cooperatives and BOP have a united aim to strengthen the weak and increase their wealth. The weak infrastructure emphasizes the needs for new solutions. Like cell phone services, which is an example of new solutions adjusted for the poor that works as a BOP strategy. Increased and improved education and knowledge for the farmers are essential factors for rural development. Educated farmers that have more knowledge about their production will gain power towards the middlemen...|$|R
