5|$|The brigade was {{the first}} of the US Army's Engineer Brigades to be {{converted}} to a <b>modular</b> <b>design.</b> This means that the Brigade can be deployed and sustain itself independently, without a division or corps level command supporting it. Additionally, the brigade's design allows it to take command of additional units within a theatre of operations, allowing for greater versatility on the battlefield.|$|E

40|$|Collaboration in {{large-scale}} projects introduces challenges involving both coordination (the ability to collaborate) {{as well as}} cooperation (the willingness to do so). Existing research has shown how <b>modular</b> <b>designs</b> can improve the challenge of coordination by concentrating interdependencies within rather than between different subsystems. Based on an in-depth case study of collaboration in a large-scale infrastructure project, our study highlights an effect of modularity on collaboration that previously has been overlooked. Specifically, we show that while <b>modular</b> <b>designs</b> may help overcome coordination challenges by reducing interdependencies between modules, it can in turn hamper cooperation by emphasizing specialization within modules. Therefore, though existing work typically perceives modularity and integration as opposites, we show how they can act as complements. Specifically, we show how firms need to complement <b>modular</b> <b>designs</b> with integration practices that stimulate cooperation. Overall, we contribute to the literature on collaboration and modularity by showing when and how organizations can combine modularity and integration {{in the context of}} complex collaboration...|$|R

5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a <b>modular</b> <b>design,</b> with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|The 3.1 Sarge {{release was}} made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the {{software}} and included over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a <b>modular</b> <b>design,</b> Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} most {{important}} result of the raid was the technical knowledge that British scientists gained.

This was confirmed during the interrogation of the captured German technician, who proved to be less well trained than his British counterparts.|$|E

40|$|The {{method and}} {{implementation}} of <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> is too complicated, time consuming and not popular among architects. Thus, this thesis will do a detailed investigation of <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> method {{to find out what}} has made this method so difficult to use. At the end of the study, this thesis will present a solution and introduces a computer aided <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> system. The Malaysian government has promoted the application of Modular Coordination for the purpose of making the Open Building System a reality. Currently, the response towards the implementation of Modular Coordination has not been encouraging although there have been efforts by the government to ensure its success. The reason is because it must conform to MS: 1064 standard and specification where space and building components have to be designed in accordance with specific positioning and dimensioning. The use of computer as a support tool has always been regarded as ubiquitous solution to solve complex design problems and therefore, has the potential to aid <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design.</b> The research started with literature review and initial survey to assess design facts and to identify the level of complexity in <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design.</b> It is followed by interviewing six architects to ascertain how the conventional <b>design</b> process for <b>Modular</b> Coordination is currently done. Consequently, after the findings and conclusion, a solution to overcome the problem is presented where a computer aided <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> is proposed. To simulate and show how the system works, REVIT software was customised for this system. The system is later implemented for a government quarters project which was designed earlier using conventional <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> method to identify its strength and weakness. The study found that <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> rule is posing a lot of constraints and tends to restrict architects during the early design stage, and the use of computer does not help the architects in conforming to the rule. To overcome these problems, a computer aided <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>Design</b> System that complies with the Modular Coordination rule is introduced which initiated the design process with parametric objects. A comparison between both design methods found that the <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>design</b> that uses the proposed system has more advantages that includes; conforming to Modular Coordination rule at the early design stage, easier to use and takes less time to produce. The thesis has proposed a Computer Aided <b>Modular</b> Coordination <b>Design</b> System for architects to aid design implementation according to the Modular Coordination rules at ease...|$|R

25|$|VLC, {{like most}} {{multimedia}} frameworks, {{has a very}} <b>modular</b> <b>design</b> which {{makes it easier to}} include modules/plugins for new file formats, codecs, interfaces, or streaming methods. VLC 1.0.0 has more than 380 modules. The VLC core creates its own graph of modules dynamically, depending on the situation: input protocol, input file format, input codec, video card capabilities and other parameters. In VLC, almost everything is a module, like interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, scalers, codecs, and audio/video filters.|$|E
25|$|Early on, the {{decision}} to adopt four engines for a feeder airliner rather than two was viewed as atypical by some commentators. Advantages of adopting the four engine configuration include greater redundancy and superior takeoff performance from short runways, {{as well as in}} hot and high conditions.
