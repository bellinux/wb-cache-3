5|$|The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for {{the first}} time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> were practiced and then finally the <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who, despite {{evidence}} to the contrary, deny that the moon landings took place. The Apollo <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> hoax claims helped propel conspiracy theories into a quasi-political narrative.|$|E
5|$|When President Kennedy first {{chartered}} the <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> program, {{a preliminary}} cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess {{of what could}} not possibly be determined precisely, and James Webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.|$|E

Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.|$|R
5|$|Gilruth asked Jeannette {{to work as}} a {{consultant}} at NASA. She accepted and lived in a house in Houston she shared with another woman. Jeannette spoke to the scientific community and to the public at NASA about the space program from 1964 to 1970, when Project Apollo was created and Apollo 11 made the first manned <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> in 1969. Gilruth then noticed a shift in her interests, away from space and towards religion.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, ILC {{was sold}} to Stanley Warner Corporation for $15 million($ in modern dollars). The {{following}} year, {{it was the first}} to advertise under-garments on network television. In 1962, the industrial division of Playtex was awarded a contract to develop space suits for the Apollo mission to the moon. Two years prior to the 1969 <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> that used its latex suits, Playtex's industrial division was spun off, eventually becoming ILC Dover.|$|E
5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing {{the development of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E

5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to {{the lunar surface}} and spent {{two and a half}} hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Tides are the {{movement}} of water across Earth's surface caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun, and the rotation of Earth which manifest in the local {{rise and fall of}} sea levels. Tides are driven by the relative positions of the Earth, Sun, <b>Moon,</b> <b>land</b> formations, and relative location on Earth.In the lunar month, the highest tides occur roughly every 14 days, at the new and full moons, when the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun are in alignment. These highest tides in the lunar cycle are called spring tides.|$|R

5|$|Beatrice Alice Hicks (January 2, 1919– October 21, 1979) was an American {{engineer}}, {{the first}} woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric, and both co-founder and {{first president of the}} Society of Women Engineers. Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> missions.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage {{that had to be}} converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E

5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's 1961 {{commitment}} to a staffed <b>moon</b> <b>landing</b> {{before the end of}} the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of unstaffed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for staffed missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program produced the first close-up pictures; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9. The staffed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and staffed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first staffed mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E

In Austria, the album debuted at number three and was certified Gold in its first week, achieving Platinum certification a month later. In France, Prism debuted in the Top 10, spending a dozen weeks in the Top 40, and has sold over 130,000 copies according to SNEP. In the United Kingdom, it peaked {{at the top of}} the charts, where it was certified Platinum and went on to sell 433,000 copies by February 2017. In The Netherlands and Denmark, the album debuted and peaked at number four. As of August 2015, Prism has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Nixon ended American {{involvement}} {{in the war in}} Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home, and ended the military draft. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 <b>moon</b> <b>landing,</b> which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 when he defeated George McGovern.|$|E

As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} <b>moon</b> <b>landing.</b> As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's <b>Moon</b> <b>landing</b> goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
