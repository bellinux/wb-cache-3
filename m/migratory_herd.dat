40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the Pen Islands Herd of caribou, the largest aggregation of caribou in Ontario (it also occupies a portion of northeastern Manitoba). Photographic counts showed the herd had a minimum population of 2300 in 1979, 4660 in 1986, 7424 in 1987 and 10 798 in 1994. Throughout the 1980 s, the Pen Islands caribou exhibited population behaviour similar to migratory barren-ground caribou herds, although morphology suggests they are woodland caribou or possibly a mixture of subspecies. The herd had well-defined traditional tundra calving grounds, formed nursery groups and large mobile post-calving aggregations, and migrated over 400 km between tundra summer habitats and boreal forest winter habitats. Its migration took it into three Canadian jurisdictions (Ontario, Manitoba, Northwest Territories) and {{it was important to}} residents of both Manitoba and Ontario. It is clear that the herd should be managed as a <b>migratory</b> <b>herd</b> and the critical importance of both the coastal and variable large winter ranges should be noted in ensuring the herd's habitat needs are secure...|$|E
40|$|Livelihood {{systems that}} depend on mobile {{resources}} must constantly adapt to change. For people living in permanent settlements, environmental changes that affect the distribution of a migratory species may reduce {{the availability of a}} primary food source, with the potential to destabilize the regional social-ecological system. Food security for Arctic indigenous peoples harvesting barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) depends on movement patterns of migratory herds. Quantitative assessments of physical, ecological, and social effects on caribou distribution have proven difficult because of the significant interannual variability in seasonal caribou movement patterns. We developed and evaluated a modeling approach for simulating the distribution of a <b>migratory</b> <b>herd</b> throughout its annual cycle over a multiyear period. Beginning with spatial and temporal scales developed in previous studies of the Porcupine Caribou Herd of Canada and Alaska, we used satellite collar locations to compute and analyze season-by-season probabilities of movement of animals between habitat zones under two alternative weather conditions for each season. We then built a set of transition matrices from these movement probabilities, and simulated the sequence of movements across the landscape as a Markov process driven by externally imposed seasonal weather states. Statistical tests showed that the predicted distributions of caribou were consistent with observed distributions, and significantly correlated with subsistence harvest levels for three user communities. Our approach could be applied to other caribou herds and could be adapted for simulating the distribution of other ungulates and species with similarly large interannual variability in the use of their range...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} food, weather and {{predation}} are compared between sedentary and <b>migratory</b> caribou <b>herds.</b> Sedentary herds disperse (space out) at calving time while the cows of <b>migratory</b> <b>herds</b> move in masse (space away) to calving grounds to reduce predation risk. The sedentary ecotype calves on ranges near open water if tree cover is present or in rugged topography {{in the absence}} of tree cover. The migratory ecotype aggregates on calving grounds located on alpine mountain plateaus or on the tundra north of the Arctic tree line. The two herds with the greatest densities in North America, the sedentary Slate Islands <b>Herd</b> and the <b>migratory</b> George River <b>Herd</b> both had changes in abundance that followed summer food problems. The hypothesis that winter lichen supplies determine abundance and set the carrying capacity is rejected. Lichens are not a necessary food for caribou. A review of the mortality of young calves documented in the past 30 years provides no support for the hypothesis that hypothermia is a common mortality problem. Young calves documented can be born inviable at birth if their dams are severely malnourished. The migratory caribou in North America reached peak numbers in the 1980 s after wolf populations were heavily harvested in the 1970 s. The sedentary ecotype is frequently regulated by wolf predation that affects both recruitment (R) and the mortality of adults (M). The balance between R/M schedules commonly occurs when R (calves) represents, about 15 % of the herd and when numbers (prorated to the area of the dispersed annual range) approximate 0. 06 caribou/km 2. Population limitation of <b>migratory</b> <b>herds</b> by predation has occurred in the NWT and in several herds in Alaska but only when wolf densities were &gt; 6. 5 / 1000 km 2. Wolf predation halted the growth of the George River Herd in 1980 but then wolves contracted rabies and the herd again increased and degraded spring/summer ranges. The reduced summer phytomass resulted in lower birth rates and increased the vulnerability of calves and possibly adults to wolf predation. Stabilizing mechanisms for <b>migratory</b> <b>herds</b> include movements between herds above tree line and range contractions/expansions with resultant changes in demography. It is hypothesized that the most important ecological variable in all seasonal distributions of caribou is predation risk rather than to maximize forage supplies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Conservation and {{management}} of Alaska’s caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herds are important for ecologi-cal, cultural, social, and economic reasons. While most research is directed towards the large <b>migratory</b> <b>herds,</b> smaller herds {{that may or may}} not be migratory can be an equally valuable component of the state’s faunal resources; but for many of these smaller herds, basic information on herd size, demographics, space use and movements is lacking. We compiled Very High Frequency (VHF) telemetry data collected from 1994 - 2009 on 2 such herds in central Alaska, the Hodzana Hills Herd (HHH) and the Ray Mountain Herd (RMH) and estimated abundance, survival, resource selec-tion and seasonal home ranges to inform future management of these herds. We found that both herds were relatively small and stable with approximately 1000 – 1500 individuals; annual survivorship of adult females was high (93 % and 94 % for RMH and HHH, respectively) and comparable to other stable or increasing herds in Alaska. Both herds were non-migratory maintaining seasonal ranges with substantial overlap. Additionally, despite their close proximity, we did not document any exchange of individuals between the 2 herds.

30|$|The {{difference}} in mean {{could be explained}} by the {{difference in}} the number of livestock holdings, livestock herding practices and availability of prey species. WCNP has an average livestock holding of 74 stock per herd, while in Tobesa gewog, it has only 3 stock per household. This is because all respondents in WCNP are nomads who depend entirely on livestock husbandry where as in JSWNP and Tobesa, they are farmers who rear livestock just as a part of farming practices. In WCNP, herders practice the traditional <b>migratory</b> <b>herding</b> pattern while in Tobesa and JSWNP, they practice a sedentary herding system. In the traditional migratory pattern, the livestock are grazed in different zones in different seasons, which exposes livestock to different predators.
