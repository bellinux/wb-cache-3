5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent <b>majority</b> across different groups as distinguished from a numerical <b>majority.</b> A concurrent <b>majority</b> is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a <b>majority</b> that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E

5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the <b>majority</b> value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The <b>majority</b> problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the <b>majority</b> state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a <b>majority.</b>|$|E

5|$|The new {{constitution}} {{led to the}} gradual erosion of the Democratic <b>majority.</b> In 1854, the Republican Party was established and drew {{in many of the}} former Whigs. That year the General Assembly was split with no party attaining a <b>majority.</b> The Democrats held the largest number of seats, but the Whigs and Republicans caucused to form a <b>majority</b> and control the assembly. The result was deadlock on most issues because Republicans and Whigs could not agree on most major issues. By 1858, the Whigs were almost completely disempowered and the Republicans gained enough seats to become the largest party, but not enough to form a <b>majority</b> on their own. That year Governor Ashbel P. Willard called the first special session of the General Assembly because they had been unable to pass an appropriations bill. Democrats regained a small <b>majority</b> by gaining the votes of the disaffected Whigs in the 1860 election.|$|E

40|$|Producción CientíficaIn social choice voting, <b>majorities</b> {{based on}} {{difference}} of votes and their extension, <b>majorities</b> based on difference in support, implement the crisp preference values (votes) and {{the intensities of}} preference provided by voters when comparing pairs of alternatives, respectively. The aim of these rules is declaring which alternative is socially preferred and to that, they require the winner alternative to reach a certain positive difference in its social valuation {{with respect to the}} one reached by the loser alternative. This paper introduces a new aggregation rule that extends <b>majorities</b> based on difference of votes from the context of crisp preferences to the framework of linguistic preferences. Under linguistic <b>majorities</b> with difference in support, voters express their intensities of preference between pairs of alternatives using linguistic labels and an alternative defeats another one when a specific support, fixed before the election process, is reached. There exist two main representation methodologies of linguistic preferences: the cardinal one based on the use of fuzzy sets, and the ordinal one based {{on the use of the}} 2 -tuples. Linguistic <b>majorities</b> with difference in support are formalised in both representation settings, and conditions are given to guarantee that fuzzy linguistic <b>majorities</b> and 2 -tuple linguistic <b>majorities</b> are mathematically isomorphic. Finally, linguistic <b>majorities</b> based on difference in support are proved to verify relevant normative properties: anonymity, neutrality, monotonicity, weak Pareto and cancellativeness.

40|$|Data {{from the}} 2006 CCGA {{national}} survey once again {{indicate that the}} American public is much more multilateralist than U. S. foreign policy officials. Large <b>majorities</b> of Americans favor several specific steps to strengthen the UN, support Security Council intervention for peacekeeping and human rights, and favor working more within the UN even if it constrains U. S. actions. Large <b>majorities</b> also favor the Kyoto agreement on global warming, the International Criminal Court, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the new inspection agreement on biological weapons. Large <b>majorities</b> favor multilateral uses of U. S. troops for peacekeeping and humanitarian purposes, but <b>majorities</b> oppose most major unilateral engagements.
