[...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why?

500|$|Filming Émile Zola's La Bête Humaine {{inspired}} Renoir to [...] "make a break, {{and perhaps}} {{get away from}} naturalism completely, to try to touch on a more classical, more poetic genre." [...] While shooting, Renoir began listening to baroque music by Louis Couperin, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jean-Baptiste Lully and André Grétry. He later said [...] "Little by little, <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> took shape and the subject got simpler. I kept living on baroque rhythms, {{and after a few}} more days, the subject became more and more precise." [...] He also said he began imagining Simone Simon [...] "moving to the spirit of the music." [...] This preoccupation with baroque music during filming led to Renoir's original idea of adapting Les Caprices de Marianne into a film.|$|E

The track {{was intended to be}} pressed in limited numbers for New York club DJs. However, Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis liked the mix and gave the release wide distribution in the UK. Morrissey publicly disowned the mix, and urged fans not to purchase copies. Travis later claimed, [...] "it was <b>my</b> <b>idea,</b> but they agreed. They said 'Go ahead', then didn't like it so it was withdrawn." [...] He also said, [...] "Nothing that ever happened in the Smiths occurred without Morrissey's guidance; there's not one Smiths record that went out that Morrissey didn't ask to do, so there's nothing on my conscience." ...|$|E
500|$|Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar {{were chosen}} to style the film's characters. Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job {{challenging}} because {{she had to make}} everything as authentic as possible. Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases. Initially, she was a [...] "hep" [...] character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai. According to Dhody, Chopra's look is [...] "very contemporary and a very much today's look, but <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> was to streamline and take it to the classic side [...] than making it trend-based".|$|E

Although Field avoids making Streep look like Wintour, she dresses her in generous helpings of Prada (By Field's own estimate, 40% of the shoes on Streep's feet are Prada). [...] "I know her character was originally based on Anna Wintour," [...] Field said, [...] "but I didn't want to copy someone's style." [...] But, like Wintour and her Vogue predecessor Diana Vreeland, the two realized that Miranda needed a signature look, which was provided {{primarily by the}} white wig and forelock she wore {{as well as the}} clothes the two spent much time poring over look-books for. [...] "n choosing her wardrobe <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> was that she's a chief fashion editor, she has her own style," [...] Fields told Women's Wear Daily in 2016. [...] "We're creating an original character." ...|$|E
500|$|Business {{leaders also}} took {{inspiration}} from the event, admiring its risk-taking and creative freedom, {{as well as the}} trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers. In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he [...] "wanted them to seek {{inspiration from the}} opening ceremony of the London Olympics" [...] which, he said, [...] "had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands." [...] Steve Coogan told Frank Cottrell Boyce that he felt it was [...] "like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date", and Russell T Davies told Boyce: [...] "It changed <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> of the possible." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} begins with Moon's {{simultaneous}} drum break and scream and launches in different, hard rock direction. [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> {{to cut off}} in the middle, Yardbirds-style", Beck commented, [...] "Keith upped the tempo and gave it an extra kick. [...] It's like {{a bit of the}} Who, a bit of the Yardbirds and a bit of me". The amply-distorted guitar provides [...] "a thick-toned, descending riff", according to Power. [...] He also describes the break, inspired by the Yardbirds' rave-up technique, as [...] "eerily presag the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal". [...] The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills. [...] The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects, including phasing, echo, and controlled feedback. [...] It concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock-style lead guitar and an abrupt ending.|$|E

Harris felt that the series' mediocre sales might have been partly his fault: [...] "The cover concepts were one of my editorial duties. Rich Buckler turned <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> into {{the best he could}} do, but I never felt as if <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> were good enough for his art.

It was subsequently released by Sire Records in the United States on 14 May and on CD in Europe and the United States on 24 August 1984. The album was marketed as [...] "the greatest album ever made" [...] and McCulloch later {{said it was}} because they believed it was. Although he also said it was meant as a joke when he said, [...] "That wasn't <b>my</b> <b>idea!</b> I was on the phone to , just joshing and I said 'Oh, it's the greatest album ever made.' And he used it on the poster." [...] In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, Sergeant asked, [...] "Why not?".

500|$|Moving to {{the commune}} with Hirsig, Shumway, and their {{children}} Hansi, Howard, and Poupée, Crowley described the scenario as [...] "perfectly happy... <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> of heaven." [...] They wore robes, and performed rituals to the sun god Ra at set times during the day, also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass; {{the rest of the}} day they were left to follow their own interests. Undertaking widespread correspondences, Crowley continued to paint, wrote a commentary on The Book of the Law, and revised the third part of Book 4. He offered a libertine education for the children, allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic. He occasionally travelled to Palermo to visit rent boys and buy supplies, including drugs; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life, and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity. There was no cleaning rota, and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building, which soon became unsanitary. Poupée died in October 1920, and Ninette gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea, soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{military}} and loyal militia mopped up {{the remnants of}} the rebellion in Wexford and other counties, the atrocities and sectarian violence left a mark on Cornwallis. He wrote that [...] "the life of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland comes up to <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> of a perfect misery; but if I can achieve the great object of consolidating the British Empire, I shall be sufficiently repaid." [...] In early July he issued a proclamation offering amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and took an oath to the crown, and he cracked down on the sometimes arbitrary courts martial held in the field by requiring the review of all sentences in Dublin. [...] However, not all of Ireland received this treatment: areas that were still [...] "disturbed" [...] were exempted from the requirement, Lord Castlereagh, Cornwallis' Chief Secretary, reported that [...] "numbers were tried and executed" [...] without the lord lieutenant's review. One principal stronghold of the rebels was the Wicklow Mountains, through which the army began construction of a road facilitate its operations. [...] The Wicklow Military Road survives today as the R115 road in Wexford and Dublin.|$|E

[...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} The Understudy {{was written}} by Andres Heinz; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream (2000) and described it as [...] "All About Eve with a double, set in the off-Broadway world." [...] After making The Fountain (2006), Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy; Aronofsky said McLaughlin [...] "took <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [...] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan." [...] When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures, the studio decided to fast-track development of the project in January 2007. The project [...] "sort of died, again" [...] according to Aronofsky, until after the making of The Wrestler (2008), when he had Mark Heyman, director of development of Aronofsky's production company Protozoa Pictures, write for Black Swan [...] "and made it something that was workable." [...] By June 2009, Universal had placed the project in turnaround, generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions, particularly with actress Portman attached to star. Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions, the latter financing the film. In July 2009, Kunis was cast.|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E
