30|$|In sum, our paper shows that, {{despite being}} {{associated}} with higher birth rates among relatively older women and with a higher prevalence of <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> infertility <b>insurance</b> {{does not have a}} statistically significant effect on womenâ€™s fertility {{at the end of their}} reproductive lives. The reason lies, as we further show, in the fact that infertility insurance mandates also appear to delay motherhood among relatively younger women and, hence, make conception more difficult because fecundity decreases with age.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the rise in <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and its {{influence}} on trends of low birth weight (LBW) rates in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Methods: This is a registry-based study of live births from 1994 to 2005 obtained from the national live birth information system. Chi-square tests for trends were assessed for LBW and <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates. The impact of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> on LBW trends was assessed by sequential modelling, including year and further adjustment for <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> Risk factors for <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> were assessed using the Poisson regression. Results: A total of 263 252 live births were studied. The LBW rate increased from 9. 70 % to 9. 88 % (p < 0. 001) and the <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rate rose from 1. 95 % to 2. 53 % (p < 0. 001). LBW rate increased among twins, from 57. 14 % to 63. 46 % (p = 0. 001). The twin birth rate rose by 24. 7 %, while the rate of triplets or higher-order increased by 150 %. <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> may be responsible for 23. 9 % of the increase in the LBW rate over the period. Mothers with higher levels of schooling, older mothers and mothers delivering in private hospitals were more likely to deliver <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> Conclusions: It seems that both the increase in <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and in the LBW among <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> contributed to this rise in overall LBW rate...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the increase in}} risk of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> associated with ovulation induction and calculated the proportion of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> attributable to this treatment. METHODS: Cases were 350 <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and controls were 737 single births enrolled from April 1993 to March 1994 in the Mercurio Project, an investigation of reproductive outcomes in Italy. RESULTS: Ovulation induction was used in 45 case births (12. 9 %) and 24 control births (3. 3 %); the adjusted odds ratio was 4. 1 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 4, 6. 9). The odds ratio for triplet or higher order births was 72. 2 (95 % CI = 25. 7, 202. 8). When unlike-sexed <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> were considered, the odds ratio increased for twin births, but not for triplet or higher births. The highest odds ratios were found when ovulation induction was used with assisted reproduction. The proportion of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> attributable to ovulation induction was 9. 7 % overall, 5. 4 % for twin births, and 69. 8 % for triplet or higher births.

SETTING: Academic university hospital-based infertility center and private general gynecology clinic. PATIENT(S) : Four hundred sixty-four female patients with infertility who presented for their initial visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Demographic characteristics, infertility history, desire regarding <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> knowledge of the risks of <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> and goals of infertility evaluation and treatment were determined by using a 41 -question survey.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Prevailing {{hypotheses}} {{about the causes}} of ovarian carcinogenesis predict that women with a history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> (twins, triplets, etc.) should be at increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the scant available evidence suggests that they may actually be at lower risk. To resolve this issue, we pooled data from eight studies involving 2859 parous women with epithelial ovarian cancer (case patients) and 7434 parous women without ovarian cancer (control women). In addition to assessing their history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> (and the sex of the children, where available), we obtained information on age, parity, oral contraceptive use, and other reproductive factors for each woman. Details of tumor histology were available for all case patients. We estimated the relative risks of various histologic types of ovarian cancers associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> by using multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for matching and confounding variables. RESULTS: Among these parous women, 73 case patients (2. 6 %) and 257 control women (3. 5 %) had a history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> The adjusted summary odds ratio (OR) for developing all types of epithelial ovarian cancer that are associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> was 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 61 - 1. 08). We found no evidence that risks associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> differed among women with borderline or invasive tumors and among women with same-sex and opposite-sex offspring from <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> The risk reductions appeared specific for nonmucinous tumors (n = 2453; summary adjusted OR = 0. 71 [95 % CI = 0. 52 - 0. 98]); in contrast, associations with mucinous tumors (n = 406) were heterogeneous across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Parous women with nonmucinous ovarian cancer are no {{more likely to have a}} history of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> than other parous women, counter to the predictions of current hypotheses for causes of ovarian cancer...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> are an {{important}} subgroup to consider in trials aimed at reducing preterm birth or its consequences. Including multiples results in a unique mixture of independent and clustered data, which has implications for the design, analysis and reporting of the trial. We aimed to determine how <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> were {{taken into account in}} the design and analysis of recent trials involving preterm infants, and whether key information relevant to <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> was reported. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of multicentre randomised trials involving preterm infants published between 2008 and 2013. Information relevant to <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> was extracted. RESULTS: Of the 56 trials included in the review, 6 (11 %) excluded multiples and 24 (43 %) failed to indicate whether multiples were included. Among the 26 trials that reported multiples were included, only one (4 %) accounted for clustering in the sample size calculations and eight (31 %) took the clustering into account in the analysis of the primary outcome. Of the 20 trials that randomised infants, 12 (60 %) failed to report how infants from the same birth were randomised. CONCLUSIONS: Information on <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> is often poorly reported in trials involving preterm infants, and clustering due to <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> is rarely taken into account. Since ignoring clustering could result in inappropriate recommendations for clinical practice, clustering should be taken into account in the design and analysis of future neonatal and perinatal trials including infants from a <b>multiple</b> <b>birth.</b> Lisa Nicole Yelland, Thomas Richard Sullivan, Maria Makride...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and cost-effectiveness of different induction protocols involving gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review of 648 IUI cycles. Some patients had gonadotropin injections alone before {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (hCG) and IUI (human menopausal gonadotropin protocol); others were given oral medications, then gonadotropins before hCG and IUI (combination protocol). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates, endometrial thickness, number of ovarian follicles, injection days, ampules of gonadotropins and cost. RESULTS: The combination protocol was more cost-effective. In first cycles, pregnancy rates, <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates, number of large follicles produced and cancellation rates were similar. The combination group had fewer days of injections and fewer ampules used. When all cycles were analyzed, the <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rate was lower in the combination group. Comparing the different oral medications in the combination protocols, letrozole yielded higher pregnancy rates than tamoxifen or clomiphene. <b>Multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates were similar for all oral medications. CONCLUSION: Combination protocols are less costly and equally effective, with potentially fewer <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> than with gonadotropins alone.

Result(s) Of 134, 381 ART transfer cycles performed in 2012, 51, 262 resulted in live births, of which 13, 563 (26. 5 %) were multiple births: 13, 123 twin and 440 triplet and higher order births. Almost half (46. 1 %) of these <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> resulted from the following four cycle types: two fresh blastocyst transfers among favorable or average prognosis patients less than 35 years (1, 931 and 1, 341 <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> respectively), two fresh blastocyst transfers among donor-oocyte recipients (1, 532 <b>multiple</b> <b>births),</b> and two frozen/thawed ETs among patients less than 35 years (1, 452 <b>multiple</b> <b>births).</b> More than half of triplet or higher order births resulted from the transfer of two embryos (52. 5 % of births among fresh autologous transfers, 67. 2 % of births among donor-oocyte recipient transfers, and 42. 9 % among frozen/thawed autologous transfers).

40|$|AIM: To review {{trends in}} <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> and {{associated}} mortality in England and Wales since 1975, {{in the light}} of trends for earlier years; to assess, within the limitations of the available data, the extent of any association between <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates and assisted conception and drugs used for subfertility. METHODS: Data collected routinely in England and Wales, between 1975 and 1994, were retrospectively reviewed. These comprised Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) data collected at the registration of live and stillbirths and deaths occurring under the age of 1 year in England and Wales from 1975 onwards. Department of Health data about NHS prescriptions dispensed outside hospitals within England for drugs which could be used in the medical management of subfertility were also included. RESULTS: The proportion of pregnancies that resulted in a registered <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> increased from a low of 9. 9 per thousand in 1975 to 13. 6 per thousand in 1994. Up to 1992, the increase was seen in all age groups except for women under 20, with the most substantial increase being in women aged 35 to 39. The rise in the rate of triplet and other higher order births was much steeper than that for all <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> increasing from 0. 13 sets of triplets per thousand maternities in 1975, to 0. 41 in 1994. Prescriptions dispensed for selected drugs that may be used for the medical management of subfertility and assisted conception became more common over this period. The fragmented nature of the data precluded direct comparison with changes in <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates, however. CONCLUSIONS: Although the causes of the rise since 1980 in <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> rates in general, and the dramatic rise in the triplet rate in particular, cannot be ascertained or quantified directly from routinely collected data, drugs used for subfertility and more recently, assisted conception, probably had a major role...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} benefits of increasing reproductive rate indicate a need to determine the feasibility of increasing the frequency of twinning in cattle, either by selection or by an artificial method. Rate of reproduction has {{a major impact on}} life cycle costs of production for different meat animal species and, thus, upon the production resources for which different species are competitive. For example, the average beef cow is capable of producing about. 7 of her body weight per year in progeny market weight, but the comparable multiple is 8 in pigs and more than 70 in meat chickens. The objectives of this project focus on gaining the understanding needed to develop a technology for increasing the frequency of twinning in cattle.
