5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid <b>mater</b> and the more delicate inner pia <b>mater.</b> Between the arachnoid <b>mater</b> and the pia <b>mater</b> is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia <b>mater,</b> is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E

5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura <b>mater,</b> the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid <b>mater.</b> Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia <b>mater.</b> Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
