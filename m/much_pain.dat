5|$|Parts of {{the pain}} {{sensation}} and processing system may not function properly; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a pap smear {{should not}} cause <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> {{but it can}} if the woman has certain {{untreated}} vaginal problems such as cervical stenosis or vaginismus, or if the person performing it is too harsh, or uses the wrong size speculum.|$|E

25|$|A {{more romantic}} legend {{tells of a}} giant named Arogo who was {{extremely}} powerful and youthful. Arogo {{fell in love with}} Aloya, who was a simple mortal. Aloya's death caused Arogo <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> and misery, and in his sorrow he could not stop crying. When his tears dried, the Chocolate Hills were formed.|$|E
25|$|On {{his fifth}} day in custody, Heirens {{was given a}} lumbar {{puncture}} without anesthesia. Moments later, Heirens was driven to police headquarters for a polygraph test. They tried {{for a few minutes}} to administer the test, but it was rescheduled for several days later after they found him to be in too <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> to cooperate.|$|E
25|$|For 60 days, my {{body was}} used as a {{thoroughfare}} for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so <b>much</b> <b>pain.</b> They raped me in front of my six children... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS.

25|$|It is now {{accepted}} that the neonate responds more extensively to pain than the adult does, and {{that exposure to}} severe pain, without adequate treatment, can have long-term consequences. Despite the difficulty of assessing how <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> a baby is experiencing, and the practical problem of prescribing the correct dosage or technique for treatment, modern medicine is firmly committed to {{improving the quality of}} pain relief for the very young.|$|E
25|$|Jim Laker {{announced}} his retirement from First Class cricket {{at the start of}} the tour because of his arthritic spinning finger, which was at times immobile and sometimes caused him so <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> that he could not sleep at night. Laker retired from bowling in one match, missed the next due to sunstroke and the Fourth Test because of arthritis, but played in the Fifth Test despite having a sore throat and high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Secretary Rumsfeld {{assured the}} world that the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were going to be treated in a manner {{consistent}} with the treatment of Geneva Convention POWs. In 2004, confidential memos surfaced that discussed the limits to how <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> discomfort and fear could be used in the interrogation of detainees in the global war on terror. The memos showed that debate within the Bush administration had been resolved in favor of what was later legally determined to be torture.|$|E

25|$|That July while {{swimming}} in the Starnbergersee Erb was dashed against a rock by the sea and found later on the beach by Frau Ivogün. By luck his life was saved, but the convalescence was long and painful and he never fully recovered. In January 1930 he reappeared before the public with Ivogün, and still in <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> travelled to the Netherlands to sing Florestan. In June 1930, he made his last operatic appearance, a performance worthy of his powers, at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Oper under Furtwängler, as Florestan. In April 1931, Erb and Ivogün were divorced, torn apart by deep and conflicting feelings. Two years later, he learnt that she had married Michael Raucheisen, his former accompanist, {{with whom he had}} hoped to work again: it was a doubly crushing blow.|$|E
25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind {{the eye to}} reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light. These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive {{for a few hours}} while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain blurry {{for the rest of the}} day. Though there should not be <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|According to Berdella, Pearson {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{cooperative}} of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an iron rod to render him submissive, Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse; as a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he (Berdella) would not continue to inflict as <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, in order that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or being returned to the basement.|$|E

25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How can an essentially non-toxic venom that causes so <b>much</b> <b>pain,</b> described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts {{are invited}} to Rosings Park, the {{imposing}} home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy's extremely wealthy aunt. She expects Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy managed to save a friend from a bad match by convincing the friend of the lady's indifference. Elizabeth realizes the story must refer to Jane and is horrified that Darcy has interfered and caused her sister so <b>much</b> <b>pain.</b> Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, has {{fallen in love with}} Elizabeth and proposes to her. She rejects him angrily, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Mr. Wickham unjustly. The latter accusation seems to anger Mr. Darcy, and he accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself. They part, barely speaking.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} to {{make it all the way}} to the NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk for the next few days. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN is one of the many websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E

Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so <b>much</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too <b>much</b> <b>pain</b> in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E
