5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E

Nor did they search the woods behind the apartments, and they only returned later to search one other apartment in the complex. They did not seem to canvass the area, either, never knocking on doors and asking residents what they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments.|$|E

25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E
25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They kept an eye for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E

25|$|The History {{of early}} Islamic Tunisia opens {{with the arrival}} of the Arabs who brought their {{language}} and the religion of Islam, and its calendar. The Arab conquest followed strategy designed by the Umayyad Caliphate regarding its long-term conflict with the Byzantine Empire. The native Berbers eventually converted to Islam. They <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> some similarities between themselves and the Arabs, in similar cognate culture, such as familiarity with a pastoral way of life. The first local Islamic ruling house, the Aghlabids, consisted primarily of rule by leading members of this Arab tribe. Fundamental elements of Islamic civilization were established. Although accepting Islam, many Berbers nonetheless resisted rule by the Arabs, establishing the Rustamid kingdom followiing the Kharijite revolt. Next in Ifriqiya (Tunisia) arose the Shia Fatimids, inspired by a few immigrants from the east yet consisting for the most part of Ifriqiya Berbers. The Fatimids later expanded their rule east, through conquest by Berber armies of Egypt, and established their caliphate there which came to include Syria and the Hejaz.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

500|$|Son of God ran for {{a single}} series of three episodes, each of which focused on a {{different}} stage of Jesus's life. The first episode, [...] "The Real Man", looked at the historical evidence {{for the existence of}} Jesus, and documented his life from his birth to his temptation. Episode two, [...] "The Mission", discussed how Jesus became popular among Jews and Greeks, and why the Pharisees of the area <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him as a threat. [...] "The Final Hours", the third and final episode of Son of God, looked at Jesus's crucifixion, and presented some ideas as to how the traditional views of the crucifixion may conflict with how it really occurred. The episode concluded with the construction of a computer-generated animation of how Jesus may have appeared.|$|E
500|$|Episode two, [...] "The Mission", {{discusses}} how Jesus {{became popular}} {{and why the}} Pharisees <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him as a potential threat. Bowen visits the Dome of the Rock, the site of Jerusalem's temple, and discusses how Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee to recruit his disciples. He speaks with Orna Cohen, a conservator of antiquities who led the excavation of the Sea of Galilee Boat, who suggests that the boat may have been similar to one owned by Saint Peter. Bowen then travels to Capernaum and visits the House of Peter, where he speaks to Mordechai Aviam, an archaeologist from the Israel Antiquities Authority. Aviam states that first-century Greek [...] "graffiti" [...] in the house suggests that the house belonged to Peter. Bowen visits the tomb of a first-century scholar and miracle-worker named Hanina ben Dosa, and contrasts Hanina's life with that of Jesus's: for example, while Jesus was executed, Hanina was not.|$|E
500|$|This {{characterisation}} of the Scots {{was often}} politically motivated, {{and many of}} the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots: [...] "cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery." [...] A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade, who encountered Scots and wrote that: [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid." ...|$|E

500|$|Jean Holm (The Times Higher Education Supplement) too {{noted the}} fast growth of {{conservative}} Christian schools {{but added that}} the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices. Richard V. Pierard (Christian Century) felt that Peshkin wrote with [...] "deeply respect" [...] for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was [...] "disturbed" [...] by the community's [...] "indoctrinated" [...] values—"biblical absolutes" [...] that are [...] "part of a conservative program that has been read into Scripture". Paul F. Parsons (Christianity Today) noted that Peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms, with standardized tests, orderly climate, and [...] "fun-loving" [...] students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn [...] "choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [...] dissent". Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as [...] "remarkably representative" [...] based on his own visits to [...] "Christian schools in 60 cities", though others are less absolutist. And while Julian McAllister Groves (Journal of Contemporary Ethnography) described the text as [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "poetic", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted as they said, and felt that Peshkin <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> more [...] "role distance" [...] and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.|$|E
