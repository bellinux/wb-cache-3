25|$|MPS IV, <b>Morquio</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is {{estimated}} to occur in 1 in 700,000 births. Its two subtypes result from the missing or deficient enzymes N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) (Type A) or beta-galactosidase (Type B) needed {{to break down the}} keratan sulfate sugar chain. Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include spinal nerve and nerve root compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas. Intelligence is normal unless hydrocephalus develops and is not treated.|$|E

Skeletal abnormalities include a bell-shaped chest, a flattening or curvature of the spine, shortened long bones, and dysplasia of the hips, knees, ankles, and wrists. The bones that stabilize the connection between the head and neck can be malformed (odontoid hypoplasia); in these cases, a surgical procedure called spinal cervical bone fusion can be lifesaving.

40|$|Cardiac {{involvement}} is well recognised in most {{forms of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses but there is poor documentation of abnormalities specific to <b>Morquio's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (type IV mucopolysaccharidosis). Ten patients with the classic form or type A <b>Morquio's</b> <b>syndrome</b> with a median age of 12. 5 years underwent echocardiographic assessment. Abnormalities were detected in six (60 %) cases with mitral valve involvement in five patients and aortic valve disease in four. One patient had severe mitral leaflet thickening {{to the point of}} mitral stenosis. Two patients had evidence for myocardial involvement by way of echocardiographic ventricular hypertrophy. The cardiac lesions were haemodynamically mild. A cardiac murmur was audible in only three of the six cases. It is concluded that there is a high prevalence of silent cardiac abnormalities in patients with <b>Morquio's</b> <b>syndrome</b> with predominantly left sided valve involvement.

50|$|Luis Morquio (September 24, 1867 - June 19, 1935) was a Uruguayan {{physician}} and professor. A medical condition, <b>Morquio</b> <b>syndrome</b> (mucopolysaccharidosis IV), is named in his honor.|$|E
30|$|Patients with “classic” <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> {{generally}} have very short stature. Although growth is typically normal during infancy, growth velocity usually starts to decline {{after the age}} of 1 year [27]. By the age of 3  years, growth delay is evident. As a result, standard atlases cannot be used to stage growth in these patients. Patients with “non-classic” <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> often present with normal stature that fails to stay within normal limits during the pre-adolescent growth spurt [15]. Consequently, determination of bone age and growth potential is difficult and must be considered when formulating treatment plans. Growth charts for <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> have been developed and can offer some guidance in this regard [27]. Familiarity with the phenotypic variability in <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> is required for interpretation of these growth charts.

40|$|Glycosaminoglycans were {{isolated}} from the urine of three patients with Hurler's, Hunter's and <b>Morquio's</b> <b>syndromes</b> and also from the liver and spleen of the case of Hurler's syndrome by a procedure avoiding further degradation. A method of determining the proportions of dermatan sulphate, heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate in each preparation is described. The relative proportions of these glycosaminoglycans in the urine and organs of the case of Hurler's syndrome were very similar. Glycosaminoglycans from the organs were of much lower molecular weight than normal, consisting of single chains of molecular weight about 5000 together with multiples of up to four such chains attached to peptide moieties. The linkage region normally attaching glycosaminoglycan chains to protein in whole protein–polysaccharides of connective tissue was degraded progressively towards serine. The total output and relative proportions of abnormal glycosaminoglycans in the urine were compared in two brothers with Hunter's syndrome examined on two occasions 4 years apart. At comparable ages they excreted about the same amount, and the relative proportions of each glycosaminoglycan remained essentially constant. The composition and chromatographic behaviour of the glycosaminoglycan in the urine from the case of <b>Morquio's</b> <b>syndrome</b> indicated that it consisted of material containing about one-third keratan sulphate and two-thirds chondroitin sulphate {{as part of the}} same molecule, as in proteoglycans of cartilage.

30|$|With {{the recent}} {{availability}} of ERT for <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome,</b> early and accurate diagnosis becomes critical for improved patient outcomes. Because skeletal abnormalities are common initial presenting symptoms and typically bring {{a patient to}} medical attention, orthopedic surgeons are uniquely positioned to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of this disorder. Classic clinical signs and symptoms include marked short stature, genu valgum, kyphoscoliosis, pectus carinatum, abnormal gait and joint laxity. These findings are frequently not evident until {{the third or fourth}} year of life. Typically, the earliest musculoskeletal manifestation is the characteristic thoracolumbar gibbus, which is often evident in the first 6  months. Familiarity with the radiographic manifestations of dysostosis multiplex aids the recognition of a possible MPS disorder [24]. Classic radiographic findings include abnormally shaped vertebral bodies with anterior beaking, posterior scalloping, platyspondyly, dens hypoplasia, short ulna, steep radius, short and broad metacarpals with proximal rounding, delayed carpal bone maturation, rounded iliac wings, inferiorly tapered ilia, and hypoplastic epiphyses [24, 25, 26]. In practice, however, there is wide variability in presentation, leading to the potential for a delayed or missed diagnosis. In patients with non-classic phenotypes, the radiographic manifestations associated with dysostosis multiplex may be subtle or absent, and epiphyseal and/or vertebral changes may resemble those of other skeletal disorders/dysplasias [25]. Recent case series that highlight the challenges of diagnosing <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> suggest that MPS should be considered in suspected cases of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and bilateral Perthes-like disease [15, 16]. Consideration of the overall clinical picture is also important, as non-skeletal manifestations such as corneal clouding, umbilical hernias and cardiac valve disease can yield vital clues for achieving a correct diagnosis. Once clinical suspicion of an MPS disorder has been established, the patient should be referred to a geneticist for biochemical testing. Diagnostic enzyme testing is required for a definitive diagnosis of <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome,</b> since urinary glycosaminoglycan analysis alone can be misleading [15, 16, 26]. Significantly reduced or absent GALNS enzyme activity in isolated leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts is diagnostic of Morquio A syndrome; however, additional enzyme analyses to rule out <b>Morquio</b> B <b>syndrome</b> and multiple sulfatase deficiency are highly recommended for definitive diagnosis [26]. Molecular analysis can also be useful in confirming a diagnosis of <b>Morquio</b> A <b>syndrome</b> if two known causative mutations can be identified [26]. A diagnostic testing algorithm has recently been published to streamline this complex process [26].|$|R
