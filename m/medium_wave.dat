5|$|The {{format of}} this wave of pirate radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time.

5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{considers}} {{the problems of}} providing radio communication in area of the Northern Sea Route as the main route for petroleum and gas products transportation from the Arctic shelf region of Russian Federation. The conclusion is made that thanks to the stationarity of the <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> channel {{and the possibility of}} radio communication at distances which are significantly higher than the zone of direct visibility because of the diffraction and refraction, the using of <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> can be considered as a reserve system, being secondary micro waves radio connection system and requiring less expenditures for its deployment...|$|R

40|$|Wave {{patterns}} in lambskin hair follicles {{are an important}} factor determining the quality of sheep's wool. Hair follicles in lambskin from Hu sheep, a breed unique to China, have 3 types of waves, designated as large, medium, and small. The quality of wool from small wave follicles is excellent, while the quality of large waves is considered poor. Because no molecular and biological studies on hair follicles of these sheep have been conducted to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of different wave patterns is currently unknown. The aim {{of this article was}} to screen the candidate microRNAs (miRNA) and genes for the development of hair follicles in Hu sheep. Two-day-old Hu lambs were selected from full-sib individuals that showed large, <b>medium,</b> and small <b>waves.</b> Integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles employed high-throughout sequencing technology. Approximately 13, 24, and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between small and large <b>waves,</b> small and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> and <b>medium</b> and large <b>waves,</b> respectively. A total of 54, 190, and 81 differentially expressed genes were found between small and large <b>waves,</b> small and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> and <b>medium</b> and large <b>waves,</b> respectively, by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology and pathway analyses. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport, and were associated with MAPK and the Notch signaling pathway. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of differentially-expressed miRNA and genes were consistent with sequencing results. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression indicated that, compared to small waves, large waves included 4 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 8 upregulated genes and 3 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn influenced 13 downregulated genes. Compared to small <b>waves,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> included 13 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 64 upregulated genes and 4 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn had regulatory effects on 22 downregulated genes. Compared to <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> large waves consisted of 13 upregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 48 downregulated genes. These differentially expressed miRNAs and genes may {{play a significant role in}} forming different patterns, and provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of hair follicles of varying patterns...|$|R
5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Global {{announced}} on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, {{a move that}} coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and {{to replace it with}} a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday 23 November 1978 {{the station}} moved to two new <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> {{frequencies}} (275m and 285m) which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved {{coverage of the}} UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> only until the early 80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency {{for a number of}} hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings.

40|$|Hu sheep {{lambskin}} is {{a unique}} white lambskin from China that exhibits three types of flower patterns, including small <b>waves,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> and large waves, with small waves considered the best quality. However, {{our understanding of the}} molecular mechanism underlying flower pattern formation in Hu sheep lambskin is limited. The aim {{of the present study was}} to further explore the relevance between candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) and developmental characteristics of hair follicles and screen miRNAs for later functional validation. Herein, we employed Illumina Hiseq 2500 to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in hair follicles of different flower patterns with small, <b>medium,</b> and large <b>waves</b> to construct a comprehensive sequence database on the mechanism of hair follicle development. Paraffin sections of lambskin tissue were prepared to assess the structure of different hair follicles. Expression levels of candidate miRNAs in different flower patterns were analyzed by relative quantitation using real-time PCR, combined with histological observation and micro-observation technologies, and the correlation between expression levels of candidate miRNAs and histological properties of hair follicles was analyzed by using SPSS 17. 0. A total of 522 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and RNA-seq analysis detected 7, 266 target genes in different groups of flower patterns. Gene ontological analysis indicated these target genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, apoptosis, and ion transport, and 14 miRNAs, including miR- 143, miR- 10 a, and let- 7 were screened as candidate miRNAs in Hu sheep hair follicle growth and development. In the same field of vision, variance analysis showed that the number of secondary follicles in small waves was significantly larger than that in large and <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> (P< 0. 01); the diameter of the primary and secondary follicles in large waves was respectively larger than those in <b>medium</b> and small <b>waves</b> (P< 0. 01). Combined with correlation analysis between miRNA expression and histological properties of hair follicles, highly significant differences in miRNA- 143 expression levels between large and small waves were observed (P< 0. 01), and significant differences in the miRNA- 10 a expression levels between large and small waves (P< 0. 05) and in let- 7 i expression levels between large and <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> were observed (P< 0. 05). Significant differences in the expression of novel miRNAs of NW_ 004080184. 1 _ 6326 between <b>medium</b> and large <b>waves</b> were detected (P< 0. 05), and highly significant differences between <b>medium</b> and small <b>waves</b> were observed (P< 0. 01). Highly significant differences in the expression level of NW_ 004080165. 1 _ 8572 between medium and large and small waves (P< 0. 01), in that of NW_ 004080181. 1 _ 3961 between <b>medium</b> and small <b>waves</b> (P< 0. 01), and in that of NW_ 004080190. 1 _ 13733 between <b>medium</b> and large <b>waves</b> were observed, whereas no significant differences in the other miRNAs among large, <b>medium,</b> and small <b>waves</b> were detected. Overall, the present study showed that miRNA- 143, miRNA- 10 a, let- 7 i, NW_ 004080184. 1 _ 6326, NW_ 004080165. 1 _ 8572, NW_ 004080181. 1 _ 3961, and NW_ 004080190. 1 _ 13733 could be considered as important candidate genes, indicating these seven miRNAs may play significant roles in hair follicle growth and development in Hu sheep lambskin...|$|R

25|$|The Copenhagen Frequency Plan of 1948 {{resulted}} in Norway only being allocated one <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> and one long wave frequency. The audio quality diminished as Norwegian transmitters {{were forced to}} share frequencies with foreign channels. This could be overcome by installing a network of FM broadcasting transmitters. The Telegraphy Administration rejected FM, stating that this would require the entire country to buy new radios. A 1949 plan proposed a new long wave transmitter at KlÃ¸fta and a national network of <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> transmitters. NRK accepted the transmitter at KlÃ¸fta, but rejected the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> transmitters. As {{twenty percent of the}} population lacked acceptable radio coverage, NRK decided in 1953 to build FM transmitters in Western Norway and Agder to reach these areas. An advantage of building FM transmitters was that they could be co-located with television transmitters, reducing the roll-out costs.|$|E

40|$|The <b>medium</b> scale {{planetary}} <b>wave</b> regime, consisting {{largely of}} zonal wavenumbers 5 - 7, frequently dominate the summer Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation. We {{perform a diagnostic}} study of this circulation as simulated by the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) general circulation model (GCM). The analysis of Hovmoller diagrams, space-time and zonal wavenumber spectra shows that the CCC GCM is able to simulate the observed <b>medium</b> scale <b>wave</b> regime. The zonally averaged meridional eddy heat and momentum transports and the associated baroclinic and barotropic energy conversions are also examined. The distributions of the transports on the vertical plane agree well with observations. When compared to the observed summer 1979 distributions, some quantitative differences remain: the vertical structure of the heat transport is too baroclinic, while the momentum transport tends to be too weak. The baroclinic and barotropic conversions all show a <b>medium</b> scale <b>wave</b> signal. The time evolution of the Richardson number of the mean flow suggests that the <b>medium</b> scale <b>wave</b> {{is due to a}} finite amplitude baroclinic instability...|$|R
50|$|Because {{at these}} {{frequencies}} atmospheric noise is {{far above the}} receiver signal to noise ratio, inefficient antennas much smaller than a wavelength {{can be used for}} receiving. For reception at frequencies below 1.6 MHz, which includes long and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> loop antennas are popular because of their ability to reject locally generated noise. By far the most common antenna for broadcast reception is the ferrite-rod antenna, also known as a loopstick antenna. The high permeability ferrite core allows it to be compact enough to be enclosed inside the radio's case and still have adequate sensitivity.|$|R
