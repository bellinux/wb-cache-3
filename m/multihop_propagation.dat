2500|$|The {{ionosphere}} is {{a region}} of the upper atmosphere, from about 80km to 1000km in altitude, where neutral air is ionized by solar photons and cosmic rays. When high frequency signals enter the ionosphere obliquely, they are back-scattered from the ionized layer as scatter waves. If the midlayer ionization is strong enough compared to the signal frequency, a scatter wave can exit {{the bottom of the}} layer earthwards as if reflected from a mirror. Earth's surface (ground or water) then diffusely reflects the incoming wave back towards the ionosphere. Consequently, like a rock [...] "skipping" [...] across water, the signal may effectively [...] "bounce" [...] or [...] "skip" [...] between the earth and ionosphere two or more times (<b>multihop</b> <b>propagation).</b> Since at shallow incidence losses remain quite small, signals of only a few watts can sometimes be received many thousands of miles away as a result. This is what enables shortwave broadcasts to travel all over the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In multi-hop {{wireless}} sensor networks {{the need}} for remote reprogramming is created by evolving application requirements and software errors. In this context, resource-awareness, time-efficiency, and the integration of appropriate security solutions are keys to the success and acceptance of a code update mechanism. To satisfy this demand, this work provides a dependable data dissemination protocol for time-efficient and secure code updates in large-scale {{wireless sensor networks}}. The <b>multihop</b> <b>propagation</b> scheme is based on security-enhanced fountain codes and means from fuzzy control theory. In a simulation study our approach was found to perform substantially faster than the current de-facto standard Deluge. The applied distributed fuzzy control strategy allowed mitigating the hidden-terminal problem.

40|$|International audienceIntervehicular {{communication}} (IVC) is {{an important}} emerging research area {{that is expected to}} considerably contribute to traffic safety and efficiency. In this context, many possible IVC applications share the common need for fast <b>multihop</b> message <b>propagation,</b> including information such as position, direction, and speed. However, it is crucial for such a data exchange system to be resilient to security attacks. Conversely, a malicious vehicle might inject incorrect information into the intervehicle wireless links, leading to life and money losses or to any other sort of adversarial selfishness (e. g., traffic redirection for the adversarial benefit). In this paper, we analyze attacks to the state-of-the-art IVC-based safety applications. Furthermore, this analysis leads us to design a fast and secure multihop broadcast algorithm for vehicular communication, which is proved to be resilient to the aforementioned attacks...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the network}} behaves {{differently}} in different traffic phases, a single transmission mode may not perform stably under the changing VANET environment. Ducourthial et al. [5] suggest that better performances {{could still be}} obtained with some context-aware conditions, forged with a program {{that takes into account}} the traffic road characteristics. The experiment results in [6] also clearly indicate that designing a smart message dissemination strategy is fundamental in order to implement fast and reliable <b>multihop</b> message <b>propagation.</b> Based on the available traffic states, a routing algorithm adaptive to different traffic flows is proposed in this paper to improve forwarding performance. The point-to-point transmission is adopted in traffic jam to avoid broadcast storm in a stable networking environment. Owing to fragile connectivity in free traffic flow, the point-to-multipoint mode is used to guarantee a certain reliable transmission. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can improve packet delivery ratio and throughput under the scenarios with different traffic flows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A network {{programming}} protocols {{provide an}} {{efficient way to}} update program images running on sensor nodes without having physical access to them. Securing these updates, however, remains a challenging and important issue, given the open environment where sensor nodes are often deployed. Several approaches addressing these issues have been reported, but their use of cryptographically strong protocols means that their computational costs (and hence, power consumption and communication costs) are relatively high. I propose a novel scheme to secure a multihop network programming protocol through the use of multiple one-way hash chains. The scheme is shown to be lower in computational, power consumption and communication costs yet still able to secure <b>multihop</b> <b>propagation</b> of program images. Features: � A cost-effective security scheme for network programming. � Power consumption evaluation. � A simple but effective method to counter tunnel (wormhole) attack. � Immediate verification. � Extensibility to other broadcast application in WSNs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of the beaconing mechanism underlying active safety vehicular applications in presence of different levels of channel congestion. The importance of this study {{lies in the fact that}} channel congestion is considered a major factor influencing communication performance in vehicular networks, and that ours is the first investigation of the effects of congestion based on extensive, real-world measurements. The results of our study reveal that congestion has a profound impact on the most important beaconing performance metric, namely, packet (beacon) inter reception time, influencing not only the average value, but also the shape of the distribution. Congestion also considerably increases the frequency of potentially dangerous situation-awareness blackouts, with a likely negative impact on the effectiveness of active safety applications. Our study also reveals that <b>multihop</b> <b>propagation</b> of beaconing information can be used as an effective means of lessening the negative impact of congestion on beaconing performance...|$|E
30|$|Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN; Chisham et al. 2007) is {{currently}} the widest high-frequency (HF) (8 – 20  MHz) radar network that actively utilizes ground backscatter (GB) to study ionospheric processes. The use of GB has been given special importance with {{the extension of the}} SuperDARN to mid-latitudes (Baker et al. 2007), where the percentage of ionospheric coherent echoes is sufficiently lower in comparison with polar and sub-polar regions. In contrast to ionospheric echoes, GB has a more regular and predictable behavior and can be successfully used for different scientific and applied purposes, such as monitoring HF propagation condition (Hughes et al. 2002; Bland et al. 2014), testing ionosphere models, and studying traveling ionospheric disturbances (Samson et al. 1990; Bristow et al. 1994; Karhunen et al. 2006; Chisham et al. 2007). The multimode character of GB, which is related to the <b>multihop</b> <b>propagation</b> mechanism and appearance of several HF waveguides, creates difficulties in automatic interpretation of radar data. Another limiting factor is the relatively low accuracy of GB mapping related to HF wave refraction caused by different regular (diurnal and seasonal ionosphere variations, solar activity) and irregular conditions (ionospheric disturbances, geomagnetic activity). Measurement of the elevation angle allows advancements in efficiently solving the mentioned problems (Milan et al. 1997). However, the shortcomings arising from regular ionospheric gradients and the lack of accuracy in mapping techniques remain in the latter case too.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{multihop}} underwater acoustic line network, {{which consists}} {{of a series of}} equal-distance hops connected by relay transceivers in a tandem, is considered. Messages are originated as coded packets from a source node at one end, relayed sequentially hop by hop (decoded and re-encoded), and finally received by a destination node {{at the other end of}} the network. Several key characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, namely, frequency-dependent signal attenuation and noise, interhop interference, half-duplex modem constraint, and large propagation delay, are taken into account in the analysis. Simple transmission protocols with spatial reuse and periodic transmit/receive schedule are considered. Performance bounds and scheduling design are developed to satisfy the half-duplex constraint on relay transceivers in the presence of long propagation delay. To efficiently cope with frequency-dependent channel characteristic and interhop interference, the power spectral density (PSD) of the signaling is analytically optimized in a way analogous to water filling. Furthermore, the problem of determining the minimum number of hops to support a prespecified rate and reliability with and without a maximum coded packet length constraint is examined. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the analysis.

40|$|Abstract—Intervehicle {{communication}} (IVC) {{is emerging}} in research prominence for the interest {{that it is}} generating in all major car manufacturers and for the benefits that its inception will produce. The specific features of IVC will allow the deployment of a wide set of possible applications, which span from road safety to entertainment. Even if, on the one hand, these applications share the common need for fast <b>multihop</b> message <b>propagation,</b> on the other hand, they possess distinct characteristics in terms of generated network traffic. The {{state of the art}} of current research only proposes solutions specifically designed for a single application (or class) that is not directly extendable to a general IVC context. Instead, we claim that a privileged architecture exists, which is able to support the whole spectrum of application classes. To this aim, we propose a novel IVC architecture that adapts its functionalities to efficiently serve applications by quickly propagating their messages over a vehicular network. We conducted an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. As representative case studies, we considered two application classes that, for their network traffic characteristics, are at the opposite boundaries of the application spectrum: safety and entertainment. Index Terms—Intervehicular communication (IVC), multihop broadcasting, networked interactive entertainment, road vehicle safety. I...|$|R
