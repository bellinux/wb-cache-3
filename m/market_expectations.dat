500|$|After a brief pause, Rajinikanth {{starred in}} Baba in 2002, {{for which he}} had also written the screenplay. Released with much fanfare and hype at the time, the film {{featured}} a story revolving around the reforming of a gangster, who is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu saint Mahavatar Babaji, and fights against political corruption. It fell short of <b>market</b> <b>expectations</b> and the high bids reportedly translated to heavy losses for the distributors. Rajinikanth himself repaid the losses incurred by the distributors. The film was received with comments such as [...] "the bloom was off the rose" [...] and that [...] "the gold does not glitter any more". Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader S. Ramadoss condemned him for smoking and posing with beedis in the film. He was criticised for spoiling the Tamil youth by glorifying smoking and drinking.

40|$|In capital <b>markets</b> research, <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> {{of future}} {{earnings}} plays a vital role. However, almost all proxies inevitably measure the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> of future earnings with error, {{which results in}} unsatisfactory empirical outcomes in prior research (e. g., small empirical values of earnings response coefficient and poor quality estimates of expected rates of return). Using analysts' consensus forecasts, this study investigates how noisy measurement of the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> of future earnings affects the predictability of future earnings and stock returns. Based on the errors-in-variables approach, this study first provides a framework to capture cross-sectional variation of the measurement error in analysts' consensus forecasts. With this framework in place, this study documents that analysts' consensus forecasts with more measurement error have less ability to predict future earnings and stock returns, and that incorporating information about cross-sectional variation of the measurement error can improve the predictability of future earnings and stock returns. These findings will be useful to accounting research that relies on the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> of future earnings and to practitioners seeking to forecast profitability and stock returns...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to {{development}} of the crisis it was assumed by both regulators and banks that sovereign debt from the eurozone was safe. Banks had substantial holdings of bonds from weaker economies such as Greece which offered a small premium and seemingly were equally sound. As the crisis developed {{it became obvious that}} Greek, and possibly other countries', bonds offered substantially more risk. Contributing to lack of information about the risk of European sovereign debt was conflict of interest by banks that were earning substantial sums underwriting the bonds. The loss of confidence is marked by rising sovereign CDS prices, indicating <b>market</b> <b>expectations</b> about countries' creditworthiness (see graph).|$|E
2500|$|The {{liquidity}} premium theory is {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] The {{liquidity premium}} theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher {{not just because of the}} liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. [...] The <b>market</b> <b>expectations</b> hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{consumers}} {{increase the}} quantity demanded {{at a given}} price, it {{is referred to as}} an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve D1 to the new curve D2. In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from P1 to the higher P2. This raises the equilibrium quantity from Q1 to the higher Q2. [...] A movement along the curve is described as a [...] "change in the quantity demanded" [...] to distinguish it from a [...] "change in demand," [...] that is, a shift of the curve. [...] there has been an increase in demand which has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. [...] The increase in demand could also come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, <b>market</b> <b>expectations,</b> and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. [...] Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point (Q1, P1) to the point (Q2, P2).|$|E

Therefore, prices fluctuate. Thus, price volatility is due to information arrivals and hence, volatility can be forecast, based on the up-to-date information.

A large sample of Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 firms that meet or exceed their earnings expectation over the period of 1998 to 2007 is analyzed.

40|$|While the US {{dollar and}} Japanese yen are {{considered}} as safe-haven currencies, both their sovereign {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads and exchange rate have varied {{in a wide range}} since late 2007.

This paper shows evidence of information flow from the sovereign CDS market to the dollar-yen currency option market during the sovereign debt crisis from September 2009 to August 2011 when concerns about sovereign credit risks in the developed economies were triggered. The impact of the US sovereign credit risk on the risk reversal is a separable risk factor in driving the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> of the dollar-yen exchange rate after controlling other macro-financial variables.

30|$|We next {{examine whether}} the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> {{on the value}} of the E-index and excess cash differs before and after 2001 by {{including}} a triple interaction term among the E-index, excess cash, and After dummy variable.

In model (5), we use two years of lags in measuring past and future changes in control variables and obtain similar results. The results in models (4)-(5) indicate that the <b>market</b> <b>expectation</b> for the value of ATPs and excess cash did not change, though market participants learned about the value of good governance structure during the 2000 ’s. This suggests that the market did not fully anticipate that cash-rich firms with many ATPs would engage in value-destroying acquisitions, even after they obtained this information.|$|R

40|$|Volatility has {{a central}} role in various {{theoretical}} and practical applications in financial markets. These include the applications related to portfolio theory, derivatives pricing and financial risk management. Both theoretical and practical applications require good estimates and forecasts for the asset return volatility. The goal {{of this study is to}} examine the forecast performance of one of the more recent volatility measures, model-free implied volatility. Model-free implied volatility is extracted from the prices in the option markets, and it aims to provide an unbiased estimate for the <b>market’s</b> <b>expectation</b> on the future level of volatility. Since it is extracted from the option prices, model-free implied volatility should contain all the relevant information that the market participants have. Moreover, model-free implied volatility requires less restrictive assumptions than the commonly used Black-Scholes implied volatility, which means that it should be less biased estimate for the <b>market’s</b> <b>expectations.</b> Therefore, it should also be a better forecast for the future volatility. The forecast performance of model-free implied volatility is evaluated by comparing it to the forecast performance of Black-Scholes implied volatility and GARCH(1, 1) forecast. Weekl...|$|R
