The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

The man they seek will flee and will be found between the Rukn (a corner of the Kaaba containing the Black Stone) and the Maqam of Prophet Abraham (near Ka'ba). He will be forced to accept people's Bay'ah (being chosen as a Leader/Caliph). The number of those offering Bay'ah will be the same as the number of the people of Badr (Muslim fighters who participated in the Battle of Badr at time of Prophet Muhammad).

500|$|In {{the early}} days of street newspapers, people were often {{reluctant}} to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. [...] Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to [...] the general public or the homeless community." [...] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news". [...] Organizations in Montreal and San Francisco have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized as [...] "grim" [...] and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away. Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as [...] "compassion fatigue". On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as The Big Issue, are often targets of criticism for being too [...] "mainstream" [...] or commercial.|$|E

Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will.</b> I might feel I {{have to be a}} bit more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} with sexuality research is that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> not openly admit to acts of infidelity unless they are assured complete anonymity.

2500|$|Notwithstanding any {{position}} or duties retained in Cork, {{by the time}} he died Goold had lived in West Croydon for many years. The 1861 Census shows a married gentleman born in Marylebone called Henry Goold living in Pier Road, North Aylesford, Kent, with his wife Sarah, aged 35. He appears unmistakably on the Census only once: in 1881, living at 8 Canterbury Road, Croydon with a fifteen-year-old servant, Jane Smith. He is 77 years old, described as a married baronet and as a property and landowner. In April 1893, he was summoned before the County Court judge at Croydon to answer for an unpaid debt accrued by himself, but the judge declined to commit him to jail due to his advanced age. The York Herald made its own judgement, saying, [...] "If he is considered too old to be made to pay his debts, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> think he is also too old {{to be in a position}} to incur any." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie {{taking the}} drug crack cocaine {{prompted}} over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent." [...] A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying [...] "I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised {{that there have been}} so many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction.

2500|$|The Harvard Law Review {{published}} a short piece called [...] "In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law", {{much of it}} explaining how [...] "privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged." [...] Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed {{in a manner that}} might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more. [...] For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if they feel it absolutely necessary. [...] The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other. [...] However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person’s privacy by finding out information {{that can be used to}} track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet. [...] Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including iPhones automatically attach the latitude and longitude of the picture taken through metadata unless this function is manually disabled.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{theme parks}} did evolve from more {{traditional}} amusement park enterprises, such as Knott's Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott {{and his family}} sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park. Because of its long history, Knott's Berry Farm currently claims to be [...] "America's First Theme Park." [...] Knott's Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana in 1935 and included Santa's Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions, is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> argue {{that it was the}} first true Theme Park despite Knott's history. In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Celebration City and Wild Adventures.|$|E
