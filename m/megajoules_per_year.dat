40|$|Radiation {{blocking}} sunscreen coatings {{have been}} developed for the protection of elastomer seals used in low-Earth-orbit (LEO). The coatings protect the seals from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and atomic oxygen (AO) damage. The coatings were developed for use on NASA docking seals. Docking seal damage from the UV and AO present in LEO can constrain mission time-line, flight mode options, and increases risk. A low level of adhesion is also required for docking seals so undocking push-off forces can be low. The coatings presented also mitigate this unwanted adhesion. Greases with low collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) and low total mass loss (TML) were mixed with slippery and/or UV blocking powders to create the protective coatings. Coatings were applied at rates up to 2 milligrams per square centimeter. Coated seals were exposed to AO and UV in the NUV (near-UV) and UV-C wavelength ranges (300 to 400 nanometers and 254 nanometers, respectively). Ground based ashers were used to simulate the AO of space. The Sun's UV energy was mimicked assuming a nose forward flight mode, resulting in an exposure rate of 2. 5 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter per day. Exposures between 0 and 147 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter (UV-C) and 245 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter (NUV) were accomplished. The protective coatings were durable, providing protection from UV after a simulated docking and undocking cycle. The level of protection begins to decline at coverage rates less than 0. 9 milligrams per square centimeter. The leakage of seals coated with Braycote plus 20 percent Z-cote ZnO sunscreen increased by a factor of 40 after moderate AO exposure; indicating that this coating might not be suitable due to AO intolerance. Seals coated with DC- 7 - 16. 4 percent Z-cote ZnO sunscreen were not significantly affected by combined doses of 2 x 10 (sup 21) atoms per square AO with 73 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter UV-C. Unprotected seals were significantly damaged at UV-C exposures of 0. 3 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter and DC- 7 - 16. 4 percent Z-cote coated seals were undamaged at all exposures up to the limits tested thus far which were 147 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter UV-C and 245 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter NUV. The coatings decreased adhesion sufficiently for docking seals at temperatures equal to or greater than - 8 degrees Centigrade thus offer a simple and inexpensive way to mitigate adhesion...|$|R

Current and potential biofuel production systems were evaluated from a long-term continuous no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) field trial under differing harvest strategies and nitrogen (N) fertilizer intensities to determine overall environmental sustainability. Corn and switchgrass grown for bioenergy resulted in near-term net greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of - 29 to - 396 grams of CO 2 equivalent emissions <b>per</b> <b>megajoule</b> of ethanol <b>per</b> <b>year</b> {{as a result of}} direct soil carbon sequestration and from the adoption of integrated biofuel conversion pathways.

Co-locating and integrating cellulosic biorefineries with existing dry mill corn grain ethanol facilities improved net energy yields (GJ ha- 1) of corn grain ethanol by > 70 %. A multi-feedstock, landscape approach coupled with an integrated biorefinery would be a viable option to meet growing renewable transportation fuel demands while improving the energy efficiency of first generation biofuels...|$|R

5000|$|Other people {{consider}} that {{the whole idea of}} [...] "the hydrogen economy" [...] is flawed. Compressed hydrogen has an energy density of only 5.6 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> liter. Robert Zubrin looks at the practical problems of using hydrogen as an energy storage medium in Energy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil. He considers that hydrogen is a very poor form of storage, and that batteries, methanol or dimethyl ether would be better. This point is reiterated in Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy and in David MacKay's book described below.|$|R

Even when the fuel is stored as liquid hydrogen in a cryogenic tank or in a compressed hydrogen storage tank, the volumetric energy density (<b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> liter) is small relative to that of gasoline. Hydrogen has three times higher specific energy by mass compared to gasoline (143 MJ/kg versus 46.9 MJ/kg). In 2011, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory and University of Alabama, working with the U.S. Department of Energy, found a single-stage method for recharging ammonia borane, a hydrogen storage compound.|$|R

5000|$|In a maglev {{train the}} primary coil {{assembly}} lies below the reaction plate. There is a 1-10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for {{speeds up to}} 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back. A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 km/h (60 mph) and uses 4 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> passenger mile. The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and fuel use. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes.|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} resistance on a fault during slip controls earthquake dynamics. Friction dissipates heat during an earthquake; therefore, the fault temperature after an earthquake provides {{insight into the}} level of friction. The Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 343 and 343 T) installed a borehole temperature observatory 16 months after the March 2011 moment magnitude 9. 0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake across the fault where slip was ~ 50 meters near the trench. After 9 months of operation, the complete sensor string was recovered. A 0. 31 °C temperature anomaly at the plate boundary fault corresponds to 27 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> square meter of dissipated energy during the earthquake. The resulting apparent friction coefficient of 0. 08 is considerably smaller than static values for most rocks...|$|R
25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but {{the ratio of the}} heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 <b>megajoules</b> <b>per</b> cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot.|$|R

[...] By being mainly located slightly above, on or beneath the ground, a mass driver may be easier to maintain compared with many other structures of non-rocket spacelaunch. Whether or not underground, it needs to be housed in a pipe that is vacuum pumped in order to prevent internal air drag, such as with a mechanical shutter kept closed most of the time but a plasma window used during the moments of firing to prevent loss of vacuum.|$|R
