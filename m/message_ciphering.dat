40|$|Abstract- In {{this modern}} world of communications, {{cryptography}} {{has an important}} role in the security of data transmission and is the best method of data protection against passive and active fraud. Cryptography is an algorithmic process of converting a plain text or clear text <b>message</b> to a <b>cipher</b> text or <b>cipher</b> <b>message</b> based on an algorithm that both the sender and receiver know. There are a number of algorithms for performing encryption and decryption, but comparatively few such algorithms have stood the test of time. The most successful algorithms use a key.

40|$|Steganography and Cryptography are two popular ways {{of sending}} vital {{information}} in a secret way. One hides {{the existence of the}} message and the other distorts the message itself. There are many cryptographic techniques available and among them AES {{is one of the most}} powerful techniques. In Steganography, various techniques in different domains like spatial domain, frequency domain etc are available to hide messages. It is very difficult to detect hidden message in frequency domain and for this domain various transformations like DCT, FFT, Wavelets etc are available. In this paper we propose a new technique in which Cryptography and Steganography are used as integrated part along with newly enhanced security module for transmitting text. Before encryption we are using Huffman compression technique to compress the input plain text and compressed text is encrypted using advanced encryption standard (AES. After encryption, a part of the compressed encrypted <b>message</b> (<b>cipher)</b> is hidden in DCT of an image; remaining part of the cipher is used as a secret key to regenerate the cipher text.
