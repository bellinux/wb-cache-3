5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale.</b> It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse. Numerous fires broke out, mainly from overturned stoves. In Bulgaria, {{the cities of}} Ruse, Varna and Vidin were almost completely destroyed. The force of {{the earthquake}} cracked walls {{as far north as}} Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced severe shaking that registered VIII on the <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> in {{and around}} the city of Christchurch, destroying some buildings and causing additional damage to many structures affected by previous earthquakes. The damaged tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed before dismantling work could be completed. The earthquake downed phone lines and triggered widespread outages, which left around 54,000 households without power. Rebuilding costs in Christchurch increased by NZ$6 billion (US$4.8 billion) owing to the additional damage from the quake. Forty-six people suffered injuries, and one elderly man died after being knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} hit at 13:52:19 IRST, or 1:52 pm (10:22:19 UTC), {{and lasted}} between 10 and 30seconds. It killed 13people and injured 100 on Qeshm Island. In Zirang (Ziranag), a village on Qeshm, 80percent {{of the buildings}} were demolished. Seven villages experienced extensive damage, and 13 villages were destroyed: Tonban, Ramekan, Gevarzin, Khaledin, Direstan, Kushe, Karavan, Turyan, Tom senati, Gorbehdan, Ziranag, Giahdan, and Gourian. There were reports of intensity III effects on the <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> from Bandar Abbas, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah and Ras al-Khaimah; Intensity IV (Light) effects occurred at Sharjah. Shaking from the earthquake was also noted in Oman. No major damage occurred directly at the epicenter; residents of Qeshm reported that the shaking smashed windows, leading citizens to evacuate their homes fearing collapse. In total more than 2,000 people were affected.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{lasted for}} four minutes, according to contemporary accounts. The estimated magnitude of 7.4 {{is taken from}} the extent and degree of the recorded damage, with a very large area that reached X (Extreme) or more on the <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} was {{the last}} large event to occur along {{that portion of the}} San Andreas Fault, and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Modified <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> (MM) near Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains, and along the San Andreas Fault from Mil Potrero (near Pine Mountain Club) in the San Emigdio Mountains to Lake Hughes in the Sierra Pelona Mountains. Accounts of the events' effects varied widely, including the time of the main shock as well as foreshocks that occurred at several locations earlier in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Reports of the quake's {{intensity}} in Christchurch generally ranged from IV to VIII (moderate to severe) on the modified <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale.</b> A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake. Sewers were damaged, and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located {{to the southwest}} of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 {{percent of the city}} was disrupted. Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the quake. About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas. One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread. Damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported. By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres. The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.|$|E

50|$|Starting January 22, Aysén Fjord {{suffered}} {{a series of}} minor earthquakes. The greatest before April 21 reached VI (Strong) on the <b>Mercalli</b> intensity <b>scale</b> and occurred at 3:44 p.m. on April 14. Local fishermen reported seeing steam rising from the fjord. The earthquake expanded to several zones of the country. At 6:22 a.m. (local time) on April 22, an intense earthquake was felt in Santiago, reaching II (Weak) on the <b>Mercalli</b> intensity <b>scale.</b>|$|R
500|$|Owing to the {{moderate}} {{magnitude of the}} quake, significant shaking was felt only in localized parts of Costa Chica, registering strongest at VI (strong) on the <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> in Azoyú and V (moderate) in populous areas around the epicenter. Lighter ground motions (MMIVIII) were perceived in much of Guerrero, including Acapulco and Chilpancingo, with weak tremors (MMII) reported {{as far away as}} in Mexico City, about 300km (187mi) from the epicenter. The capital city rests on a former [...] of largely unconsolidated sedimentary layers, so earthquake shaking in its vicinity is generally amplified.|$|E
500|$|The region {{near the}} triple {{junction}} experiences high seismicity, {{with more than}} 60 earthquakes of intensity VI (Strong) or greater or magnitudes ≥ 5.5 since 1853. The mainshock in the sequence (11:06a.m. Pacific Daylight Time) occurred onshore, [...] west of Petrolia {{at a depth of}} 10.5 kilometers, and was among an infrequent number of earthquakes with fault-plane solutions that conveyed evidence of slip at the Cascadia subduction zone. While the focal mechanism indicated slip on a thrust fault striking N.10°W with a shallow dip of 13° to the east-northeast, the rupture most likely propagated to the west, based on the mainshock location at the southeastern boundary of the aftershock zone. Investigation of more than 1,200 surveys from the North Coast area led to the assignment of an intensity rating of IX (Violent) on the Modified <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> for the region near Petrolia.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{destructive}} earthquake in Santa Barbara history, {{and the first}} destructive earthquake in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, occurred on June 29, 1925, converting much of the town to heaps of rubble. While the quake's epicenter was centered on an undetermined fault offshore, most of the damage came about due to two strong aftershocks which occurred onshore and five minutes apart. [...] The intensity on the Modified <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> {{was determined to be}} VIII for the coast from Goleta, through Santa Barbara, and to Carpinteria.|$|E
