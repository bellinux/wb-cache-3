40|$|Abstract. In power plants, {{several major}} {{components}} such as steam genera-tor tubes, boilers, steam/water pipe lines, water box of condensers {{and the other}} auxiliary components like bolts, nuts, screws fasteners and supporting assemblies are commonly fabricated from plain carbon steels, as well as low and high alloy steels. These components often fail catastrophically due to hydrogen embrittle-ment. A brief overview of our current understanding of the phenomenon of such hydrogen damage in steels is presented in this paper. Case histories of failures of steel components due to hydrogen embrittlement, which are reported in literature, are briefly discussed. A phenomenological assessment of overall process of hydro-gen embrittlement and classification of the various damage modes are summarized.

40|$|The {{need for}} microalloyed steels {{resistant}} to harsh environments {{in oil and}} gas fields, such as pre-salt which contain considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), requires that all sectors involved in petroleum industry know {{the factors that influence}} the processes of corrosion and failures by hydrogen in pipelines and components fabricated with microalloyed steels. This text was prepared from a collection of selected publications and research done at the Electrochemical Processes Laboratory of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department, Polytechnic School, São Paulo University. This document does not intend to be a complete or exhaustive review of the literature, but rather to address the main scientific and technological factors associated with failures by hydrogen in the presence of wet hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), particularly, when related to the Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC) phenomenon. This complex phenomenon that involves several successive stages, HIC phenomena were discussed in terms of environmental and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables.</b> The HIC starts with the process of corrosion of steel, therefore must be considered the corrosive media (H 2 S presence) effect. Moreover, it is necessary to know the interactions of compounds present in the electrolyte with the metal surface, and how they affect the hydrogen adsorption and absorption into steel. The following stages are hydrogen diffusion, trapping and metal cracking, directly related to the chemical composition and the microstructure, factors that depend strongly on the manufacture of steel.

40|$|The. use of high-chromium {{cast irons}} for {{abrasive}} wear resistance is restricted {{due to their}} poor fracture toughness properties. An. {{attempt was made to}} improve the fracture characteristics by altering the distribution, size and. shape of the eutectic carbide phase without sacrificing their excellent wear resistance. This was achieved by additions of molybdenum or tungsten followed by high temperature heat treatments. The absence of these alloying elements or replacement of them with vanadium or manganese did not show any significant effect and the continuous eutectic carbide morphology remained the same after application of high temperature heat treatments. The fracture characteristics of the alloys with these <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> were evaluated for both sharp-cracks and blunt notches. The results were used in conjunction with metallographic and fractographic observations to establish possible failure mechanisms. The fracture mechanism of the austenitic alloys was found to be controlled not only by the volume percent but was also greatly influenced by the size and distribution of the eutectic carbides. On the other hand, the fracture mechanism of martensitic alloys was independent of the eutectic carbide morphology. The uniformity of the secondary carbide precipitation during hardening heat treatments was shown to be a reason for consistant fracture toughness results being obtained with this series of alloys although their eutectic carbide morphologies were different. The collected data were applied to a model which incorporated the microstructural parameters and correlated them with the experimentally obtained valid stress intensity factors. The stress intensity coefficients of different short-bar fracture toughness test specimens were evaluated from analytical and experimental compliance studies. The. validity and applicability of this non-standard testing technique for determination of the fracture toughness of high-chromium cast irons were investigated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thermochemical}} treatment namely carburising on the fatigue behaviour of one carbon and two alloy steels {{has been studied}} in rotating and unidirectional bending. The effect of carbon profile on the unidirect¬ional bending fatigue strength of 63 SA 14 was assessed, and {{it was found that}} single stage carburising with a surface carbon content of 0. 8 % has resulted in a higher fatigue strength than other types of carbon profiles. Residual stresses and other <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> arising from different carbon profiles, were also considered. The highest compressive stresses h~e resulted from boost-diffuse-carburising. On the other hand surface decarburisation was associated with tensile residual stresses and a reduced fatigue strength. Retained austenite was found to be detrimental in unidirectional bending fatigue; however its presence in carburised 83 SAIS did not seem to influence the rotating bending fatigue strength. Carbide particles in globular and/or intergranular form were detrimental to compressive residual stresses; the unidirectional bending fatigue strength is markedly lowered. The highest fatigue strength was accomplished by vacuum carburising. The absence of internal oxidation was the key factor in the increased fatigue strength; the presence of uniformly distributed fine carbide particles did not upset the superior fatigue strength of vacuum carburised pieces. The effect of mean stress on the fatigue strength of carburised 63 SA 14 was studied. Increasing the mean stress as would be expected resulted in a decreased fatigue strength. Carburisation showed its advantages at low mean stress, but at high mean stress it offers little advantage over the uncarburised hardened conditions. Notch effect was also studied in unidirectional bending of carburised 080 MlS. The general trend showed that the fatigue strength decreases with increasing the stress concentration factor. But different carburising conditions have different effect on notch sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is constantly looking at ways to keep costs down in high temperature and high pressure (HPHT) well completions. The use of duplex or super duplex stainless steel (DSS or SDSS) for production tubing rather than high alloy (austenitics or nickel based) steels is one way to achieve this. An effective use of DSS or SDSS requires an understanding of the effects of environmental and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> on the general and localised corrosion behaviour and resistance to environment assisted cracking (EAC) in HPHT well conditions. This research investigates the behaviour of small scale SDSS pipes subject to combined loads in a chloride and sulphide environment which are commonly found in the non-production annulus of oil and gas well completions. The effects of H 2 S (which can sometimes leak from the production fluid) on the chloride-based fluid and ammonium bisulphite in the non-production environment is examined. This is used to provide a realistic assessment of the type of fluid that SDSS production tubing may be exposed to in service. Experimental results are presented for the failure envelope under combined internal pressure and axial tension, and mechanical properties of SDSS pipe over a range of temperatures. A standalone autoclave was designed and commissioned to study the initiation of EAC in SDSS pipes in several aqueous solutions under a range of loading conditions: internal pressure, axial load, and a combination of internal pressure and axial load. The work presented in this thesis shows that corrosion tests can be carried out using small scale pipes for better understanding of the effects of stress state on corrosion behaviour. In particular, the safe working envelope of SDSS in terms of load combination, chloride-sulphide environment and temperature is determined in this thesis. This would help the end user understand and gain better in-service performance of SDSS in oil and gas HPHT environment. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. Materials {{in almost}} all {{components}} are subjected {{to some kind of}} loading that must be correctly predicted to produce reliable designs. The understanding of a material's properties significantly impacts appropriate selection for a structure. This kind of material characterization is also important in the development of improved or new materials for high strength and novel applications. There are numerous <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> (composition and process parameters) that influence the physical and mechanical properties of materials. The aim of this work has been to study the influence of microstructure on mechanical properties of steel, specifically the effect of grain sizes within solid phase mixtures. Parameters for simple models of the variation of material properties with grain size can be determined. These models can then be incorporated in the material data sets of Finite Element Analysis programs which will then allow for structural analysis with zones in a material having different grain sizes. The deformation and damage behaviour of EN 8 steel have been stUdied with emphasis on the effects of grain size on the elastic-plastic response of the material. For that purpose, EN 8 specimens with a range of microstructures (grain size and phase) were prepared by heat treatment The microstructural features were carefully characterized using two different experimental surface microscopy techniques; Light Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope. The deformation and hardness characteristics have been studied with the help of tensile and hardness tests. The mechanical properties were determined as a function of microstructure (grain size and phase). The yield stress followed the classical Hall-Petch relation. The results indicated that tensile strength and hardness increases with decrease in grain size while elongation decreases. The main philosophy behind this research has been the study of the microstructure and information from the iron-carbon phase diagram together with numerical analysis of stress-strain data, in order, to understand the influence of grain size on mechanical behaviour of EN 8 steel. This combination was then used to make general conclusions on mechanical behaviour of EN 8 based on heat treatment history...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{emphasis}} on productivity and quality control has provided an impetus to research on better methodologies for diagnosis, modelling, monitoring, control and optimisation of mineral process systems. One {{of the biggest}} challenges facing the research community is the processing of raw sensor data into meaningful information. Information that to some extent express quality parameters such as chemical assays, size distribution and other <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> in the different process streams. This thesis shows how multivariate statistical methods can be used with great advantage to model process data as well as robust sensor data. The modelling approach has been applied on a large process section, a cobbing plant, as well as a single unit operation, a tumbling mill. The knowledge of conditions inside a tumbling mill are of limited extent, due to a very harsh and wearing environment. A strain gauge sensor that measure the deflection of a lifter bar when it hits the charge inside a tumbling mill is studied for different operating conditions in a pilot scale ball mill. The deflection of the lifter bar during every mill revolution gives rise to a characteristic signal profile that is shown to contain information on both the charge position and grinding performance. The results presented for prediction of grinding performance suggest that the strain gauge signal in combination with wavelet transformation and multivariate data analysis provide promising means for monitoring and control of process fluctuations. The low prediction error achieved for grinding performance clearly highlights the importance of well-planned experimental strategy including experimental design, signal pre-processing, multivariate modelling and validation. Results also demonstrate that different operating conditions is well distinguishable from each other and by that the finding of proper operating regimes are highly feasible. Grinding parameters that are normally measured in the laboratory are now readily modelled from the on-line signal. As a consequence this opens new possibilities for real time monitoring and control of the grinding process. A further objective of this work is to link computational results to the experimental data obtained from the instrumented pilot ball mill. The approach taken is to simulate the behaviour of a rubber lifter when it is exposed to forces from the grinding load in a two-dimensional Distinct Element Method (DEM) mill model. Typically walls in a DEM model are made up of rigid bodies where the equations of motion are not satisfied for each individual wall - i. e., forces acting on a wall do not influence its motion. Here the instrumented rubber lifter is represented as an assembly of bonded particles rather than walls in order to simulate deflection. The deflection profile obtained from the DEM simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to the pilot mill measurements. The difference is attributed to the fact that time-dependent behaviour of the rubber lifter is ignored, resulting in rapid relaxation of the lifter when the exerted force is released. Mill charge features such as toe and shoulder position of the charge are well marked. However, DEM prediction shows lower values compared to measurements which is most likely an effect of the two dimensional model used and the inability to model the effect of slurry present in the mill. The news value of the thesis work is in the method for analysing the signal profile as well as the experimental verification in both pilot and full scale operation. The result is a contribution to improved mill lifter design and continuous monitoring of the grinding process. Godkänd; 2005; 20061004 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} the work performed during the research activities {{developed in the}} three-years course of scientific training for the attainment of the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The research was mainly focused {{on the study of}} the physical metallurgy of Duplex stainless steels, a particular class of stainless steels having a biphasic austeno-ferritic microstructure, with the aim to characterize their microstructural stability as a consequence of heat treatments and cold plastic deformation. The choice of the research topic was dictated by the increasing use of these steels for industrial applications, being able to provide high-strength features and elevated performances against corrosive attacks, making them particularly suitable and competitive in aggressive environments, also as structural materials. However, there are limitations to the use of Duplex steels, owing to the occurrence of microstructural modifications, either during high-temperature exposures or as a result of cold working, which can compromise their interesting features. The thesis is organized into three main parts; the first chapter is focused on properties, problems and applications of Duplex stainless steels, providing a general introduction about these materials and in which particular emphasis was given to those <b>metallurgical</b> <b>variables</b> that affect the production process and the microstructural stability. In Chapter 2 and 3, the research activities concerning the effects of heat treatments (Chapter 2) and cold rolling (Chapter 3) the on the Duplex properties are presented and discussed. It was considered appropriate to report a brief summary of literature {{at the beginning of the}} second chapter, aimed to provide the reader with the “state of art” on the effects of thermal cycles on Duplex steels properties, whereas the remaining sections of the chapter are a constitutive part of the research activities. In addition, the experimental part discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 has been integrated with a section devoted to the study of Duplex application at an industrial scale (Appendix A), aimed to the employment of these materials in marine environment. Finally, Appendix B reports the results concerning archaeometallurgical studies, which has contributed to the scientific training of the candidate, even if it was not related to the main research topic. Experiments and training courses were mainly carried out in facilities and laboratories pertaining to the Industrial Engineering Department (DII) of the University of Padua – and particularly those belonging to the DII “metallurgy group” – under the supervision of Prof. Irene Calliari and Prof. Emilio Ramous. However, certain specific activities have required the involvement of other structures external to the University of Padua; among these, the neutron diffraction measurements were carried out in the INES diffractometer, located at the ISIS facility in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Didcot, UK), in collaboration with Dr. Antonella Scherillo and Dr. Francesco Grazzi (CNR of Florence), while the magnetic measurements were performed in the laboratories of the University of Budapest (BME), in collaboration with Prof. István Mészáros.

Marco Pizzo (Unilab Laboratori Industriali srl), in the Exova CTR srl laboratories. The results of the studies pertaining to the research period and reported in this thesis have contributed to enhance the knowledge about Duplex stainless steels, in relation to the effects that microstructural modifications can induce on the materials properties, and were of appropriate scientific relevance to allowing their presentation in international conferences and their publication in scientific journals...|$|R

A mechanistic understanding of high temperature tensile deformation of this alloy has already been presented in an earlier investigation. The current investigation has been focused on the evaluation of crack-growth behavior, fracture toughness, stress-corrosion-cracking and creep deformation of this alloy as functions of different <b>metallurgical</b> and mechanical <b>variables.</b> The results of crack-growth study under cyclic loading indicate that this alloy exhibited greater cracking tendency with increasing temperature at a constant load ratio (R). However, the effect of temperature on crack-growth-rate was more pronounced within a temperature range of 100 - 150 °C when the R value was kept at 0. 1. The fracture toughness of this alloy in terms of J IC was significantly reduced at 100 °C compared to those at higher temperatures. As to the cracking susceptibility of this alloy in an acidic solution, the average crack-growth-rate was gradually reduced with increasing exposure time probably reaching a near threshold value following eight months of testing. Limited data on creep testing suggest that Alloy 276 may be capable of withstanding time-dependent deformation at 750, 850 and 950 °C under sustained loading equivalent to its 10 percent yield strength values at these temperatures.

40|$|The {{performance}} optimisation of overhead conductors {{depends on}} the systematic investigation of the fretting fatigue mechanisms in the conductor/clamping system. As a consequence, a fretting fatigue rig was designed and a limited range of fatigue tests was carried out at the middle high cycle fatigue regime in order to access an exploratory S-N curve for a Grosbeak conductor, which was mounted on a mono-articulated aluminium clamping system. Subsequent to these preliminary fatigue tests, {{the components of the}} conductor/clamping system, such as ACSR conductor, upper and lower clamps, bolt and nuts, were subjected to a failure analysis procedure in order to investigate the <b>metallurgical</b> free <b>variables</b> interfering on the fatigue test results, aiming at the optimisation of the testing reproducibility. The results indicated that the rupture of the planar fracture surfaces observed in the external At strands of the conductor tested under lower bending amplitude (0. 9 mm) occurred by fatigue cracking (I mm deep), followed by shear overload. The V-type fracture surfaces observed in some At strands of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm) were also produced by fatigue cracking (approximately 400 mu m deep), followed by shear overload. Shear overload fracture (45 degrees fracture surface) was also observed on the remaining At wires of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm). Additionally, the upper and lower Al-cast clamps presented microstructure-sensitive cracking, which was folowed by particle detachment and formation of abrasive debris on the clamp/conductor tribo-interface, promoting even further the fretting mechanism. The detrimental formation of abrasive debris might be inhibited by the selection of a more suitable class of as-cast At alloy for the production of clamps. Finally, the bolt/nut system showed intense degradation of the carbon steel nut (fabricated in ferritic-pearlitic carbon steel, featuring machined threads with 190 HV), with intense plastic deformation and loss of material. Proper selection of both the bolt and nut materials and the finishing processing might prevent the loss in the clamping pressure during the fretting testing. It is important to control the specification of these components (clamps, bolt and nuts) {{prior to the start of}} large scale fretting fatigue testing of the overhead conductors in order to increase the reproducibility of this assessment.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by a desire to}} understand more about the fatigue properties of HRLC and HSLA steels and the manufacturing and <b>metallurgical</b> property <b>variables</b> which influence fatigue response. This knowledge was needed by the steel industry to improve the resistance of hot rolled strip steels to fatigue failure, and by the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to improve methods of design against fatigue failure in components made from these steels. A review of the literature identified a fatigue design methodology, the local strain approach to fatigue design, which was most suited to accurate fatigue life prediction. A vital input to this design method was strain controlled fatigue test data. To provide these data, the fatigue properties of a group of ten steels, representative of the commercially available range of H R L C and HSLA strip steels available in Australia have been characterised in this study. The steel grades chosen were, two low strength steels, XA 1010 and C 1012 W, four Australian HSLA Xtraform steels, and four Japanese steels. Characterisation of fatigue properties was performed using the Ramberg-Osgood cyclic stress-strain relationship, and the Coffin-Manson cyclic strain-life relationship. The fit of these relationships was found to be quite good. However, an improved fit was obtained by using a modification to the traditional relationships proposed by Weng. These relationships also had the advantage of recognising the fatigue limit phenomenon. By characterising of the fatigue properties of the steels, the goal of providing industry with the needed input data for fatigue design, was satisfied. While, other researchers established that a steel grade could be characterised by sampling from a single position in a coil, and from a single heat, the effects of strip thickness, skin passing, and anisotropy of properties on fatigue response were unclear and have consequently been examined in the present study. Thus, integral with the process of characterising the fatigue properties of the steels, was the testing of several variants of each steel, which were chosen to represent various treatments levels of these manufacturing variables. In this way, the effects of these variables on fatigue properties were examined. The test results were arranged into a series of balanced factorial experimental designs to facilitate linear regression statistical analysis. The Ramberg-Osgood relationship was used as the basis of the cyclic stress-strain analysis, and an alternative description to the Coffin-Manson formulation was developed for the cyclic strain-life relationship. A notional (Neuber) stress-life analysis, which compared steels under similar service conditions was also employed. The effect of strip thickness was examined in 3. 2 and 5. 0 mm thickness C 1012 W and XA 1010 steels. The lack of a significant thickness effect in either the cyclic stress-strain or strain-life behaviour in these steels suggested that thickness does not have a large effect on the properties of hot rolled strip steels. Test piece orientation had a significant effect on cyclic stress-strain behaviour. In each case, the cyclic strength of the transverse test pieces w a s higher than that of the longitudinal test pieces. There was no significant effect of orientation on cyclic strain-life behaviour, however, when compared on the basis of notional stress amplitude, the transverse test pieces also had longer lives. While no significant effect of skin passing was observed on cyclic stress-strain behaviour in the Xtraform steels, a significant effect was observed in cyclic strain-life behaviour. The effect was to slightly reduce fatigue lives in the two lower strength grades. However, in the high strength grades, while fatigue lives were reduced by skinpassing at higher stress/strain amplitudes, at low stress/strain amplitudes fatigue life was improved. Consequently, the conjecture that skin-passing is beneficial to fatigue life has been demonstrated only for Xtraform 400, although implied for Xtraform 500. Equivalent Xtraform and Japanese steels were compared on the basis of notional stress-life response, however, no steel w a s clearly superior to its counterpart. Thus this part of the study achieved the goal of developing and applying methods of statistical analysis which could discriminate between the fatigue responses of. similar steels, and provide a systematic analysis of the influence of manufacturing variables on fatigue response. Since uncertainty also existed about the influence of hardness, strength, composition, and microstructure on fatigue response, these effects were examined. The goal achieved {{in this part of the}} study was to develop methods to predict difficult to obtain fatigue properties from readily available measurements such as the non-fatigue variables listed above. These relationships would be of value both in alloy design and in design against fatigue. Relationships with the parameters which define both the Ramberg-Osgood, and W e ng forms of the cyclic stress-strain relationship, including a number of reputedly successful relationships, were examined. None of these potential relationships with the non-fatigue variables, were found to hold. Relationships between 0. 2 % cyclic proof strength and hardness, tensile strength, and proof strength were, however, found. It w a s also established that stress amplitude at 0. 1 % and 0. 4 % plastic strain amplitude could be effectively related to a combination of composition variables and proof strength. This pair of relationships then allowed the prediction of the cyclic stress-strain relationships in the absence of data derived from fatigue tests. Despite the reported relationships between the parameters of the Coffin-Manson form of the cyclic stress-strain relationship and strength, in the present study none of these relationships, nor those with the other available non-fatigue variables, proved to hold. Relationships were, however, found with elastic, plastic and total strain amplitudes at various lives allowing the cyclic strength and cyclic ductility relationships to be estimated. For the fatigue strength line, relationships were found at short and long endurances. At short life, the relationship w a s with tensile strength, while at long life, the relationship was with a combination of composition variables and hardness. Additional relationships were used to identify the locus of the fatigue ductility line. Transition life could be estimated from a relationship with yield strength, and the strain at this life estimated from the fatigue strength relationship. The fatigue ductility relationship could then be estimated either by applying the average value for fatigue ductility exponent, or by estimating the locus of a point at one million cycles, from relationships with total and elastic strain, at this life. This estimation method, while not particularly accurate, w as found to be quite acceptable where no fatigue data were available experimentally. In summary, this study has characterised the fatigue properties of the formable hot rolled strip steels, available in Australia. In addition, methods have been developed, and used to determine the effects of the manufacturing variables, thickness, orientation to rolling direction, and skin-passing, on fatigue performance. Finally, relationships have been developed between fatigue properties and the more readily determined material properties, strength, hardness, composition and microstructure. These relationships provide insight into the best choices for design of fatigue resistant alloys, and allow the prediction of fatigue properties in the absence of fatigue test data...|$|R
