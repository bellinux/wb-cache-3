In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric <b>measurement</b> <b>system</b> in the United States.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} the concept of third generation performance <b>measurement</b> <b>systems.</b> First generation <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> {{were based on the}} assumption that financially biased <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> should be supplemented with non-financial indicators, including intangibles. Whilst this was a valuable development, the problem with these first generation approaches was that they were static and failed to illustrate adequately the linkages between different performance measures. Second generation <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> addressed this issue by using strategy and/or success maps to take into account the dynamic nature of performance and the transformation processes linking objectives and resources. Third generation <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> will build on these developments and seek to link explicitly the non-financial and intangible dimensions of business performance to the generation of free cash flow...|$|R

25|$|Having {{difficulties}} in communicating with German scientists, the Scottish inventor James Watt, in 1783, {{called for the}} creation of a global decimal <b>measurement</b> <b>system.</b> A letter of invitation, in 1790, from the French National Assembly to the British Parliament to help create such a system using the length of a pendulum as the base unit of length received the support of the British Parliament, championed by John Riggs Miller, but when the French overthrew their monarchy and decided to use the meridional definition of the metre as their base unit, Britain withdrew support.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{background}} research, development, and practical application of the Integrated Performance <b>Measurement</b> <b>Systems</b> and the associated audit methods.

A number of existing models and concepts have been used to provide a framework which facilitates the integration of various models, concepts, and practices into a single model. Performance <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> should be dynamic and they should change and adapt with the changing internal and external environment. There is little evidence of recognition of this need for dynamic systems within the practitioners and there is little theory and technology to facilitate creation of truly dynamic performance <b>measurement</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamics of performance <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> should be an area of focus for future research. měření výkonnosti, performance measurement, strategické řízení, strategy management, výkonnostní ukazatele, performance indicator...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} many partial {{discharge}} (PD) <b>measurement</b> <b>systems</b> on the market. There are systems that measure according to the IEC 60270 standard (conventional <b>measurement)</b> and <b>systems</b> that don’t, the so called ‘’unconventional measurement systems’’.

25|$|Fibers {{have many}} uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber {{is used to}} connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a <b>measurement</b> <b>system.</b> Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, {{or the fact that}} no {{electrical}} power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer.|$|E

Todar Mal's reforms were resisted by large land holders in India, following which the land of these zamindars was placed {{under the control of}} the Mughal treasury. Mughal surveying parties used standardised bamboo rods with iron joints to clearly record land according to the standard imperial land measures.
