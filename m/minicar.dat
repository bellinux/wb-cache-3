25|$|Progressive {{development}} of the <b>Minicar</b> and <b>Minicar</b> Deluxe continued until the more significant introduction of coil sprung independent rear suspension and the much-needed Triplex Safety glass windscreen. (The Triplex windscreen was subsequently offered by Sharp's Commercials as a retro-fit kit for the earlier <b>Minicar.)</b> This provided an ideal opportunity to relaunch the car as the Bond <b>Minicar</b> (Mark B) in July 1951.|$|E
25|$|The EB was a RWD <b>minicar,</b> but {{production}} was prevented by wartime restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Announced on 31 October 1956 as a late {{addition}} to the 1957 range, the Mark E was radically different in design from any previous <b>Minicar.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Japan's Transport and Tourism Ministry allowed local {{government}} to use ultracompact cars as transport for residents and tourists in their limiting areas. The size of ultracompact cars {{will be less}} than <b>minicars,</b> but have engine greater than 50cc displacement and able to transport 1 or 2 persons. Ultracompact cars cannot use <b>minicars</b> standard, because of strict safety standards for <b>minicars.</b> The regulation about running capacity and safety performance of ultracompact cars {{will be published in}} early autumn. Today, there are cars smaller than ultracompact cars, called category-1 motorized vehicles which it has 50cc displacement or less and only one seat for the driver.|$|R
50|$|The IIHS {{has since}} tested family cars, compact cars, <b>minicars,</b> small and midsized SUVs, minivans, muscle cars and large pickup trucks through the small-overlap test.|$|R
50|$|In April 2016, Aikawa led the {{announcement}} that Mitsubishi Motors had falsified fuel economy data for more than 600,000 vehicles made for Nissan and sold in Japan. Aikawa {{said that he was}} personally unaware, yet felt responsible. Bloomberg reported that Aikawa and other MMC executives attended meetings where fuel economy targets for the affected <b>minicars</b> were raised. During development of those <b>minicars,</b> the fuel economy targets were raised five times in two years, from an initial target of 26.4 km per liter to 29.2 km (18.14 miles) per liter.|$|R
25|$|Bond <b>Minicar</b> is {{a series}} of {{economical}} three-wheeled cars manufactured by Sharp's Commercials Ltd (the company was renamed Bond Cars Limited in 1964), in Preston, Lancashire, between 1949 and 1966.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{and early}} cars utilised stressed skin aluminium bodywork, though later models incorporated chassis members of steel. The <b>Minicar</b> was amongst the first British cars to use fibreglass body panels.|$|E
25|$|The last ever <b>Minicar</b> {{produced}} was an Estate painted only in primer in November 1966. The {{production records}} {{do not show}} any engine number for this vehicle but it is recorded as being destined for Greece.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note, as with the NHTSA's frontal impact test, vehicles across different weight categories may not be directly compared. This is because the heavier vehicle is generally considered to have an advantage if it encounters a lighter vehicle or {{is involved in a}} single-vehicle crash. The IIHS demonstrated this by crashing three midsize sedans with three smaller [...] "Good" [...] rated <b>minicars.</b> All three <b>minicars</b> were rated [...] "Poor" [...] in these special offset head-on car-to-car tests, while the midsize cars rated [...] "Good" [...] or [...] "Acceptable".|$|R

25|$|Although public {{response}} at the 1962 Motorcycle show remained encouraging, {{the changes}} to purchase tax meant there was now a much less significant price difference between the <b>Minicar</b> and other small cars and in November production was scaled back with consequential job losses.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the design}} work for the Mark B, in {{particular}} the rear suspension, {{was carried out by}} the engineer Granville Bradshaw. Bradshaw had become involved with the <b>Minicar</b> at the invitation of his brother Ewart Bradshaw, the chairman of Loxhams and Bradshaws Group of which Sharp's Commercials was a subsidiary.|$|E

50|$|As the {{standard}} was revised in <b>minicars,</b> {{the body was}} lengthened to 3,395 mm and the width increased to 1,475 mm, which allowed for improvements in collision safety performance. Safety was increased further by the SRS airbags which are also standard equipment, also in the passenger seat.|$|R
25|$|Sold as the Bond <b>Minicar</b> (the Mark A suffix {{being added}} {{only after the}} Mark B was introduced), the car was advertised as the world's most {{economical}} car. It was austere and simple in design, without luxuries. Production began in January 1949, although 90 per cent of the initial production {{was said to have}} been allocated to the overseas market.|$|E
25|$|Production of the Mark G {{began in}} August 1961 and {{initially}} the Bond 250 G <b>Minicar</b> {{was the only}} version available. The new style roof offered several inches more headroom and incorporated a backward-slanted rear window of the type popularised in the UK by the Ford Anglia. This was initially mirrored by nominal fibreglass tailfins inserted into the aluminium rear wings before the wings became entirely made from fibreglass.|$|E
25|$|As {{things turned}} out, {{demand for the}} Mark D <b>Minicar</b> was such that a {{decision}} was made to delay the introduction of the Mark E until later. Despite one of the prototypes being used for an extensive European tour in the summer of 1957 by one magazine, it was not until other pre-production cars were tested by the factory immediately prior to full production that issues with the car's handling were revealed.|$|E

25|$|Early on, Sharp's {{adopted a}} policy of continual gradual {{upgrading}} of the <b>Minicars,</b> either to simplify or reduce maintenance, to redress noted failings or to improve some aspect of performance. Such changes were usually made available as kits to enable existing owners to upgrade their own cars retrospectively.|$|R
25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B <b>Minicar</b> were very subtle. The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car.|$|E
25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the <b>Minicar</b> was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome side trim and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the side trim and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|E
25|$|Four {{versions}} of the car were offered by the factory: the two/three seater Standard Tourer and Deluxe Tourer and the four seat (two adult front seats and two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats) Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety. The two/three seater models were also available directly from Sharps with a detachable fibreglass hardtop. Similar aftermarket hardtops had been introduced {{earlier in the year}} for every type of <b>Minicar</b> from the Mark A to the Mark C Family by the Sharples Engineering Company, who were also based in Preston.|$|E

25|$|Its first {{enterprise}} came in 1955, when {{it agreed}} to a deal with Yugoslav carmaker Zastava to assemble Fiats for Eastern Europe. The first cars produced by Zastava were its versions of the Fiat 1300 and Fiat 1400. By 1970, Zastava was producing parts for the newer Fiat 124 and Fiat 125 models, which were assembled in Poland. The Zastava 750, launched in 1962, was Zastava's version of the iconic Fiat 600 <b>minicar.</b> It outlived the car on which it was based, with production lasting until 1981. Zastavas were not popular outside of Eastern Europe before the 1980s, although they were exported to the US and several European countries under the Yugo brand during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Sharp's Commercials was {{a company}} {{contracted}} by the Ministry of Supply to rebuild military vehicles. Knowing that the Ministry were ending their contract in 1948, and recognising {{the limitations of}} his existing works {{as a base for}} mass production, Bond approached the Managing Director of Sharp's, Lt. Col. Charles Reginald 'Reg' Gray, to ask if he could rent the factory to build his car. Gray refused, but said that instead, Sharp's could manufacture the car for Bond and the two entered into an agreement on this basis. Bond carried out some further development work on the <b>Minicar,</b> but once mass production was underway, left the project and sold the design and manufacturing rights to Sharp's.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hiatus of}} over a year, Suzuki {{returned}} to the sports <b>minicar</b> market with the new Cervo in October 1977. The SS20 Cervo was mainly a JDM model (although it was also sold as a LHD in Chile) with a 539cc three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The SS20 used the chassis from the 1976 Fronte 7-S, but was equipped with the larger T5A engine (this was the rear-mounted version of the LJ50 used in the Jimny and Fronte Hatch, {{also known as the}} T5B in the FF Alto/Fronte). The body was based on the Giugiaro designed Fronte Coupé, but with a bulge in the front and bigger bumpers which led to the loss of some of the original's grace. Instead of square headlights, the Cervo received round items. The new rear glass hatch added convenience.|$|E
