This stand also justified continued cooperation between Congress and CPI in Kerala.|$|E

For {{the rest of his}} life, Beadle served as an acting judge in special trials where suspected insurgents were tried for terrorist offences carrying the death penalty. In March 1977 he refused to try Abel Mapane and Jotha Bango, two Botswana citizens facing arms charges, ruling that since Rhodesia and Botswana were not at war and the Rhodesian Army had crossed into Botswana to capture the accused, the court had no jurisdiction. [...] "Were it not so it would <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> Court condoned the illegal abduction of Botswana nationals," [...] he explained.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the studio}} version, {{released}} on A Moon Shaped Pool, were also mostly positive. Rolling Stone and Arizona Republic named [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the best song of May 2016; Arizona Republic critic Ed Masley {{wrote that the}} new arrangement [...] "heightens the sense of desperate yearning in Yorke's vocal as he begs his lover not to leave." [...] Pitchfork named it the week's best new track, with critic Jillian Mapes writing: [...] "You don't throw true love away. You don't walk out. People who <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> much to each other wait it out, they fight. We should be grateful that Yorke {{did the same with}} 'True Love Waits'." [...] In December 2016, Pitchfork placed the song #9 in its list of the best songs of the year; critic Nathan Reese wrote: [...] "'True Love Waits' is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead's most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic. The wait was worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
500|$|XXL {{positioned}} it {{at number}} 17 {{on their list}} of the best songs of 2013. They said, [...] "'Bound 2' showed the doubters that he could still give them the soul-soaked laments that everyone wanted, he just decided not to. But that doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> song is a throwaway—the video might be more of one than the song itself—this is Kanye's introspection colliding with his self-doubt {{in a way that}} is eminently relatable to anyone with a pulse." [...] NME ranked [...] "Bound 2" [...] at number 22 on their list of the 50 best songs of 2013; [...] "in Kanye's mind this is what constituted a pop song: sped up '70s soul samples, a totally unconventional structure and lyrical gems." [...] Pitchfork Media positioned [...] "Bound 2" [...] at number 40 on their list of the top 100 tracks of 2013. They commented, [...] "On an album that takes itself awful seriously throughout, [...] "Bound 2" [...] is something that recontextualizes the entire affair, leaving more questions than answers." ...|$|E

The team created the top-down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to [...] "express large bosses that really had an impact". They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels. According to Iwata: [...] "We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search, which is why we composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas. We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and, I <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> in the best possible way, but we wanted the player to have to struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|Over 7,548 unique {{characters}} {{participated in}} the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted {{in the loss of}} 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Onlines history, estimating that the battle cost $300,000–$330,000 in real-world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While direct conversion of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for $20 USD, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> amount of real-world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Onlines economy, stated that [...] "To me, as an economist, that doesn’t really matter. In both cases this is economical value that is created by people’s work, either in real life or in virtual life. They put their blood, sweat and tears into making stuff so they can have an advantage in a battle, because in this battle like in any other battle in meat worlds, in real life, it is the resources you have available." ...|$|E
