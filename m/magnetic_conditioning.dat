40|$|This {{research}} is an innovation proposal for <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> of the aqueous-based polychloroprene contact adhesive {{with the purpose}} of increasing the adherence capacity between the adhesive and the substrate. Today, the aqueous-based polychloroprene contact adhesive presents an adhesion capacity variation between 1. 15 and up to 2. 75 kgf/cm 2. On the other hand, the solvent-based polychloroprene adhesives support average tensions of shearing of 3. 8 kgf/cm 2. To promote an increase in adhesion to the aqueous-based polychloroprene contact adhesive, we formulated one adhesive using a nano-additive, carbon dioxide as catalyst, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> process before the phase of application on the substrates. The results obtained show an average increase of 292 % in the shearing tension of the adhesive magnetically conditioned when compared with an adhesive of same formulation without the <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> and when compared to the commercial aqueous-based polichloroprene adhesive, the increase reaches 122 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} interhemispheric {{interactions between}} the human hand motor areas using transcranial cortical magnetic and electrical stimulation. A magnetic test stimulus was applied over the motor cortex contralateral to the recorded muscle (test motor cortex), and an electrical or <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> stimulus was applied over the ipsilateral hemisphere (conditioning motor cortex). We investigated {{the effects of the}} conditioning stimulus on responses to the test stimulus. Two effects were elicited at different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) : early facilitation (ISI = 4 – 5 ms) and late inhibition (ISI ≥ 11 ms). The early facilitation was evoked by a magnetic or anodal electrical conditioning stimulus over the motor point in the conditioning hemisphere, which suggests that the conditioning stimulus for early facilitation directly activates corticospinal neurones. The ISIs for early facilitation taken together with the time required for activation of corticospinal neurones by I 3 -waves in the test hemisphere are compatible with the interhemispheric conduction time through the corpus callosum. Early facilitation was observed in responses to I 3 -waves, but not in responses to D-waves nor to I 1 -waves. Based on these results, we conclude that early facilitation is mediated through the corpus callosum. If the <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> stimulus induced posteriorly directed currents, or if an anodal electrical conditioning stimulus was applied over a point 2 cm anterior to the motor point, then we observed late inhibition with no early facilitation. Late inhibition was evoked in responses to both I 1 - and I 3 -waves, but was not evoked in responses to D-waves. The stronger the conditioning stimulus was, the greater was the amount of inhibition. These results are compatible with surround inhibition at the motor cortex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany species, from {{bacteria}} to vertebrates, {{have been reported}} to use the geomagnetic field as a major cue for oriented short and long range migration [1 – 10], but the molecular nature of the underlying receptor has remained elusive. One of the main reasons may be that past attempts to train animals to respond to magnetic stimuli proved surprisingly difficult [11]. We present a novel approach to <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning,</b> using a fast, fully automated assay system relying on negative reinforcement. Weak electric impulses were applied to punish fish that failed to escape upon magnetic field alterations (avoidance behaviour). Using this assay we first demonstrate magnetosensation in Mozambique tilapia, a fish migrating regularly between freshwater and the sea. Next we wondered whether non-migratory fish have a magnetic sense, such as zebrafish, the genetic fish model organism. Zebrafish were trained in groups of 4 individuals, and statistically highly significant reactions to magnetic field changes were recorded. The demonstration of magnetosensation in zebrafish opens a possibility to genetically identify the magnetoreceptor and its downstream signalling cascade...|$|E
40|$|R 1393 <b>Magnetic</b> water <b>conditioning</b> {{to prevent}} lime scale {{formation}} {{has a long}} and controversial history. The current interpretation of the working principle is that the magnetic field interferes with crystal nucleation and growth processes resulting in formation of less adherent forms of calcium carbonate. Here we report an observation that sheds {{new light on the}} working principle. We conducted hard water through an orthogonal magnetic field. The application of the magnetohydrodynamic force on the water caused pronounced fragmentation of the natural suspended particles. This formation of suspended nanoparticles provides solution borne nucleation centers for crystallization of calcium carbonate thus preventing limestone deposition on the macroscopic surfaces.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transcranial double {{magnetic}} stimulation on {{the motor}} cortex {{was used to}} investigate central motor tract function in 16 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, five with spinal muscular atrophy, and 16 age matched normal controls. METHODS: Surface EMG responses were recorded from the relaxed abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. RESULTS: Responses to test stimuli were markedly attenuated by a subthreshold conditioning stimulus given at a condition-test (C-T) interval of 1 - 4 ms in normal controls and patients with spinal muscular atrophy, but attenuation was mild in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the normal controls this suppression was caused by activation of the intracortical inhibitory mechanism because responses to electrical test stimuli and the H wave were not suppressed by the same <b>magnetic</b> subthreshold <b>conditioning</b> stimulus. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis {{the effect of the}} conditioning cortical stimulus on the H wave was also in the normal range. CONCLUSION: The intracortical inhibitory mechanism may be impaired in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} {{a simple and}} accurate method to analyze restriction fragments using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The two complementary strands of restriction fragments are separated through hybridization to a capture probe, which is a single-stranded undigested fragment. Using the biotin–streptavidin linkage, the hybrid is immobilized on streptavidin-coated <b>magnetic</b> beads. After <b>conditioning</b> the captured restriction fragments, they are eluted from the probe and their molecular weights are determined. The proposed method greatly improves the quality, and reduces {{the complexity of the}} mass spectrum by analyzing only one of the complementary strands of restriction fragments...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is involved}} in motor learning of new procedures both during actual execution of a motor task and during observational training. These processes are thought {{to depend on the}} activity of a neural network that involves the lateral cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M 1). In this study, we used a twin-coil TMS technique to investigate whether execution and observation of a visuomotor procedural learning task is related to modulation of cerebello-motor connectivity. We observed that, at rest, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> pulse applied over the lateral cerebellum reduced the motor-evoked potentials obtained by stimulating the contralateral M 1, indicating activation of a cerebello-motor connection. Furthermore, during procedural learning, cerebellar stimulation resulted in selective facilitation, not inhibition, of contralateral M 1 excitability. The effects were evident when motor learning was obtained by actual execution of the task or by observation, but they disappeared if procedural learning had already been acquired by previous observational training. These results indicate that changes in cerebello-motor connectivity occur in relation to specific phases of procedural learning, demonstrating a complex pattern of excitatory and inhibitory drives modulated across time...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{have used}} paired {{transcranial}} stimulation of the motor cortex {{to test the hypothesis}} that cortical inhibition is decreased in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The double shock technique was adopted here because it offers a means for highlighting abnormal inhibitory mechanisms. From previous experiments performed on healthy subjects, it is known that a <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> stimulus, of subthreshold intensity, suppresses the MEP in response to a subsequent suprathreshold stimulus delivered after 1 - 4 msec. JME patients were selected as a potential contrast with other forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, because they complain of myoclonic jerks without loss of consciousness, indicating with certainty a dysfunction of the motor cortex. Two patients with sporadic grand mal and one non-epileptic patient were also investigated. Paired stimulation was produced by a Bi-stim (Magstim) stimulator, with a figure-of- 8 coil placed over the hand area of the motor cortex, and a set of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 1 to 6 msec was analyzed. In JME patients there were two indications of abnormality with respect to normal subjects and to the other epileptic patients: (1) the absence of MEP suppression to paired stimulation; (2) a progressive amplitude increase of MEPs to the test stimulus alone. In the two patients with the other form of epilepsy the pattern of inhibition was broadly preserved, even though there was some difference from the normal profile. The results suggest that the loss of MEP inhibition can be regarded as a marker of JME...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of primary constipation in elderly adults usually has a multifactorial etiology. Slow transit constipation and pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) {{are the two}} most commonly seen constipation subtypes in the elderly. PFD is usually a persistent condition that remains unresponsive to treatment in spite of various therapies currently available to relieve constipation. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the usefulness of spinal magnetic stimulation (SMS) in controlling intractable constipation in elderly patients. Methods: Nineteen patients over the age of 65 with intractable constipation were enrolled in this study, and participated in a 12 -session <b>magnetic</b> <b>conditioning</b> protocol consisting of a 20 -minute stimulation session once daily. Colonic transit time (CTT) and the dynamics of evaluation as revealed in defecography were measured, and the Knowles–Eccersley–Scott Symptom (KESS) Questionnaire was administered before the intervention, and after finishing the protocol. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in CTT and defecography following the intervention. The difference in the anorectal angles between resting and evacuation (p =  0. 001) and the changes in pelvic floor descent (p =  0. 011) both reached significance after the intervention. The mean CTT (p =  0. 001), Knowles–Eccersley–Scott Symptom score (p =  0. 001), frequency of bowel movement (p =  0. 005), unsuccessful evacuation (p =  0. 018), and time needed for bowel hygiene (p =  0. 032) all showed marked improvement after SMS conditioning. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that SMS intervention may benefit elderly patients with severe constipation. The amelioration of geriatric bowel dysfunction across the subtypes of slow transit constipation and PFD indicated that SMS, featuring broad-spectrum applications, can be an effective form of adjuvant treatment in the care of elderly adults...|$|E

Some treatments influencing the true sugar beet seed inside the pericarp (conditioning, conditioning with 16 Hz treatment) caused an increase of seed respiration on the 1 st day of germination.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaPrevious {{solid rocket}} motor {{instrumentation}} was inadequate to correlate motor performance with analysis. This is particularly obvious when flight failures occur. The addition of instrumentation, both externally and internally, to the rocket motor has helped solve this problem. External instrumentation has been implemented quite easily with existing technology. However, internal instrumentation {{has been very}} difficult to implement. This has been mainly due {{to the complexity of}} breaching the motor case. A system was developed that transmits power through the case structure to a unique encoder/signal conditioner which then transmits the data back across the case structure for analysis. This was accomplished by magnetic coupling avoiding any disruption of the case structure. A detailed discussion of the <b>magnetic</b> coupling, signal <b>conditioning</b> and encoding functions will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of geomagnetic sensitivity has been suspected {{for a long time}} in a variety of marine and terrestrial animals, many responses reported in the literature have been based on extensive statistical analysis of orientation results or rely on obscure behavioral activities (like cetacean strandings or honey bee waggle dances.) None of these reports have yet approached the level of clarity and simplicity displayed in experiments with the magnetotactic bacteria, which is the best example of geomagnetic sensitivity in any living organism. Furthermore, claims of magnetic effects on living organisms pervade the literature of biomagnetism, but many have failed subsequent attempts at replication. We need to develop simple and easily replicated experiments for marine and terrestrial animals which can be modified to answer basic questions concerning the psychophysics of any geomagnetic sensory system which might be present. In this paper, we report the first replication of the Walker-Bitterman <b>magnetic</b> anomaly <b>conditioning</b> experiment in honey bees, as well as one of our attempts to slightly alter their basic protocol. We also report our attempts to condition honey bees to magnetic direction in simple maze experiments, and the initial results of a pulse-remagnetization experiment designed to test the ferromagnetic transduction hypothesis. We conclude honey bees are sensitive to the geomagnetic field, that the signal processing for it is more complex than previously thought, and that a ferromagnetic transducer is compatible with all known behavioral data...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn awake humans, {{breathing}} {{depends on}} automatic brainstem pattern generators. It is also {{heavily influenced by}} cortical networks. For example, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and electroencephalographic data show that the supplementary motor area becomes active when breathing is made difficult by inspiratory mechanical loads like resistances or threshold valves, which is associated with perceived respiratory discomfort. We hypothesized that manipulating the excitability of the supplementary motor area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation would modify the breathing pattern response to an experimental inspiratory load and possibly respiratory discomfort. Seven subjects (three men, age 25 ± 4) were studied. Breathing pattern and respiratory discomfort during inspiratory loading were described before and after conditioning the supplementary motor area with repetitive stimulation, using an excitatory paradigm (5 Hz stimulation), an inhibitory paradigm, or sham stimulation. No significant change in breathing pattern during loading was observed after sham conditioning. Excitatory conditioning shortened inspiratory time (p = 0. 001), decreased tidal volume (p = 0. 016), and decreased ventilation (p = 0. 003), as corroborated by an increased end-tidal expired carbon dioxide (p = 0. 013). Inhibitory conditioning did not affect ventilation, but lengthened expiratory time (p = 0. 031). Respiratory discomfort was mild under baseline conditions, and unchanged after conditioning of the supplementary motor area.

40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} {{was investigated}} as an efficient, environmentally friendly, flexible alternative to conventional residential vapor compression central air conditioning systems. Finite element analysis (FEA) models of advanced geometry active magnetic regenerator (AMR) beds {{were developed to}} minimize bed size and thus magnet mass by optimizing geometry for fluid flow and heat transfer and other losses. Conventional and magnetocaloric material (MCM) regenerator fabrication and assembly techniques were developed and advanced geometry passive regenerators were built and tested. A subscale engineering prototype (SEP) magnetic air conditioner was designed, constructed and tested. A model of the AMR cycle, combined with knowledge from passive regenerator experiments and FEA results, was used to design the regenerator beds. A 1. 5 Tesla permanent magnet assembly was designed using FEA and the bed structure and plenum design was extensively optimized using FEA. The SEP is a flexible magnetic refrigeration platform, with individually instrumented beds and high flow rate and high frequency capability, although the current advanced regenerator geometry beds do not meet performance expectations, probably due to manufacturing and assembly tolerances. A model of the AMR cycle was used to optimize {{the design of a}} 3 ton capacity magnetic air conditioner, and the system design was iterated to minimize external parasitic losses such as heat exchanger pressure drop and fan power. The manufacturing cost for the entire air conditioning system was estimated, and while the estimated SEER efficiency is high, the <b>magnetic</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system is not cost competitive as currently configured. The 3 ton study results indicate that there are other applications where magnetic refrigeration is anticipated to have cost advantages over conventional systems, especially applications where magnetic refrigeration, through the use of its aqueous heat transfer fluid, could eliminate intermediate heat exchangers or oil distribution issues found in traditional vapor compression systems...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{experiments}} for magnetoreception in eusocial {{insects in}} the last decade are reviewed. Ants and bees use the geomagnetic field to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and along migratory paths. Bees show sensitivity to small changes in <b>magnetic</b> fields in <b>conditioning</b> experiments and when exiting the hive. For the first time, the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles found in eusocial insects, obtained by magnetic techniques and electron microscopy, are reviewed. Different magnetic oxide nanoparticles, ranging from superparamagnetic to multi-domain particles, were observed in all body parts, but greater relative concentrations in the abdomens and antennae of honeybees and ants have focused attention on these segments. Theoretical models for how these specific magnetosensory apparatuses function have been proposed. Neuron-rich ant antennae may be the most amenable to discovering a magnetosensor that will greatly assist research into higher order processing of magnetic information. The ferromagnetic hypothesis is believed to apply to eusocial insects, but interest in a light-sensitive mechanism is growing. The diversity of compass mechanisms in animals suggests that multiple compasses may function in insect orientation and navigation. The search for magnetic compasses will continue even after a magnetosensor is discovered in eusocial insects...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{deficit in}} interhemispheric {{transfer}} was hypothesized in alexithymia more than 30 years ago, following {{the observation that}} split-brain patients manifest certain alexithymic characteristics. However, direct evidence of interhemispheric transfer deficit has never been provided. This study investigated the hypothesis of a transcallosal interhemispheric transfer deficit in alexithymia by means of paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Methods: A random sample of 300 students was screened for alexithymia using the Italian version of the 20 -item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Eight right-handed males and eight females with high alexithymic scores and an age- and gender-matched group with low alexithymic scores were selected. A first (<b>conditioning)</b> <b>magnetic</b> stimulus was delivered to one motor cortex followed by a second (test) stimulus to the opposite hemisphere at different interstimulus intervals for both motor cortices. Motor evoked responses were recorded from the abductor digit minimi muscles. Results: High alexithymic subjects showed reduced transcallosal inhibition as compared to low alexithymic subjects at interstimulus intervals of 10, 12 and 14 ms in the left-to-right and right-to-left interhemispheric transfer directions. Conclusions: Results point to functional differences in transcallosal interactions in high alexithymic as compared to low alexithymic subjects, supporting the hypothesis of an interhemispheric transfer deficit in alexithymia.

40|$|Lesion and {{functional}} imaging studies in humans {{have suggested that}} the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) are involved in orienting attention. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study supplemented by a behavioral experiment examined the effects of 5 Hz repetitive transcranial <b>magnetic</b> stimulation (rTMS) <b>conditioning</b> to the right and left DLPFC on reaction times and synaptic activity as indexed by changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during a cued choice reaction time task. Orienting precues were either correct (valid) or incorrect (invalid) with respect to the subsequent move cue. The effects of real and sham rTMS were compared for each site of stimulation. Invalid trials showed a significant increase in response times and increases in the BOLD signal in right frontal and parietal regions when compared with valid trials. Conditioning left DLPFC with rTMS led to decreased BOLD signal during performance of this reorienting task in areas including left VLPFC and left IPS. Comparing invalid to valid trials after right DLPFC conditioning revealed decreased BOLD signal in right VLPFC. Data from the behavioral study showed that right DLPFC rTMS selectively increases response times in invalid trials. This effect was only present in the first 10 min after rTMS conditioning. No effect was found in either validly or invalidly cued trials with left DLPFC conditioning. These results suggest that 5 Hz rTMS over right DLPFC exerts remote effects on the activity of areas that functionally interact with the DLPFC during attentional processes, particularly when the reorienting of attention is more demanding as in invalid trials...|$|R
