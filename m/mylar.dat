5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation. The offer was rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the <b>Mylar</b> insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed the claim in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red <b>mylar</b> balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} for {{the book}} is made of aluminium, which was Madonna's idea, and is spiral bound and enclosed in a <b>Mylar</b> sheet. Due to the scandalous nature of the photographs and the media mayhem surrounding it from the initial preview of the book, Madonna {{did not have to}} promote Sex, except for a pre-release party and some television specials. Her publishers were extremely apprehensive about the release as well as its commercial potential. Sex was released alongside her fifth studio album Erotica, which went on sale a day earlier.|$|E
25|$|In the Early 1980s a Pterodactyl pilot named Jeff Ballas {{attended}} the Sun-N-Fun fly-in and {{was impressed with}} the <b>mylar</b> covering on the Lazair. He bought a roll of <b>mylar</b> and some tape, went home and re-covered his canard with the clear <b>mylar.</b> This experiment was a success. The handling of an Ascender with the lightweight <b>mylar</b> was much lighter and increased the nimble feeling of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear <b>mylar</b> sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} <b>mylar</b> and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the <b>mylar</b> assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, a <b>mylar</b> balloon floated into a switchyard, {{causing an}} {{electrical}} problem {{resulting in the}} shutdown of Reactor 3.|$|E
25|$|After the war, DuPont {{continued}} {{its emphasis on}} new materials, developing <b>Mylar,</b> Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were {{critical to the success}} of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, <b>Mylar,</b> Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.|$|E
25|$|Troop Leader Development (TLD), {{adapted from}} the White Stag Leadership Development Program, was {{introduced}} in 1974 to train youth leaders. The Cornerstone program was introduced to train adult leaders. Leaders who completed the course were recognized by a special version of the leader's emblem that was embroidered with <b>mylar</b> thread, giving a shiny look.|$|E
25|$|To {{cut down}} on costs, {{the opening of a}} Stargate is often just implied rather than shown, by a costless sound-effect {{followed}} by distinct lighting effects characteristic of light shining through water (as the event horizon is depicted). The DVD commentary for Stargate SG-1 explains that these effects are produced by reflecting light off large sheets of vibrating <b>Mylar.</b>|$|E
25|$|All PVC {{polymers}} are degraded by {{heat and}} light. When this happens, hydrogen chloride is {{released into the}} atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs. Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor {{in the air to}} form hydrochloric acid, polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (<b>mylar</b> is preferable).|$|E
25|$|PET was {{patented}} in 1941 by John Rex Whinfield, James Tennant Dickson {{and their}} employer the Calico Printers' Association of Manchester, England. E. I. DuPont de Nemours in Delaware, USA, first used the trademark <b>Mylar</b> in June 1951 and received registration {{of it in}} 1952. It is still the best-known name used for polyester film. The current owner of the trademark is DuPont Teijin Films US, a partnership with a Japanese company.|$|E
25|$|Typical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing {{an object}} {{on the outer}} edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of <b>mylar</b> are common objects. Also used are {{external}} clip-on muffles that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.|$|E
25|$|After the blast, an {{assessment}} crew {{consisting of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and U.S. Air Force investigators was dispersed to assess the risk to other security compounds in Saudi Arabia, and to offer suggestions for the Khobar Towers complex. It was suggested that <b>Mylar</b> tape be used to coat the windows for a barrier, but the cost, about $4.5 million, was considered prohibitive. It was also suggested that the perimeter be expanded to at least 500 feet to save servicemen from flying glass.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{reasonably}} accurate model of wind speeds within the 18â€“25km band, Google {{claims that it}} can control the latitudinal and longitudinal position of high-altitude balloons by adjusting only the balloon's altitude. By adjusting the volume and density of the gas (e.g., helium, hydrogen, or another lighter-than-air compound) in the balloon, the balloon's variable buoyancy system is {{able to control the}} balloon's altitude. Google has additionally indicated that balloons may be constructed from various materials (e.g., metalized <b>Mylar</b> or BoPET) or a highly flexible latex or rubber material (e.g., chloroprene).|$|E
25|$|Throughout history, {{artificial}} flies {{constructed of}} furs, feathers, and threads bound {{on a hook}} have been created by anglers to imitate fish prey. The first known mention of an artificial fly was in 200AD in Macedonia. Most early examples of artificial flies imitated common aquatic insects and baitfish. Today, artificial flies are tied {{with a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic materials (like <b>mylar</b> and rubber) to represent all manner of potential freshwater and saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans, worms, baitfish, vegetation, flesh, spawn, small reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds, etc.|$|E
25|$|A human-powered {{aircraft}} (HPA) is {{an aircraft}} powered by direct human {{energy and the}} force of gravity. The thrust provided by the human {{may be the only}} source. However, a hang glider that is partially powered by pilot power is a human-powered aircraft where the flight path can be enhanced more than if the hang glider had not been assisted by human power. Invented by designer Paul MacCready and constructed of <b>mylar,</b> polystyrene, and carbon-fiber rods, the Gossamer Condor was the world's first practical and successful human-powered aircraft, staying in the air for 7.5 uninterrupted minutes. By 1979, a cyclist named Byron Allen used McCready's successive model known as the Gossamer Albatross, and won British industrialist Henry Kremer's prize of $214,000 for crossing the 22-mile English Channel.|$|E
25|$|The Solar Challenger was {{designed}} to be sturdier, more powerful, and more maneuverable than the Gossamer Penguin so as to be able to withstand sustained high-altitude flight and normal turbulence. It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3inches wide and 17inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a common shaft to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller. The design incorporated advanced synthetic materials with very high strength to weight ratios, including Kevlar, Nomex, Delrin, Teflon, and <b>Mylar,</b> all supplied by the aircraft's sponsor, Dupont.|$|E
25|$|In offset lithography, which {{depends on}} {{photographic}} processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, <b>mylar</b> or paper printing plates {{are used in}} place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive emulsion. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed {{in contact with the}} emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP (Computer-To-Plate) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.|$|E
500|$|An {{electrostatic}} speaker {{has only a}} frame to support the charged diaphragm. It uses ultra-thin stretched <b>Mylar</b> (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) film as {{the main component of}} its drive units. There are two perforated plates with a potential difference of up to 10,000 volts, between which a very thin film, coated with a mildly electrically conductive substance, is sandwiched. Sound is produced when the audio signal [...] amplified by a step-up transformer [...] sets the film diaphragm into motion. The different charge between the two plates allows the diaphragm to be alternately attracted and repelled by each plate. In the original QUAD, two bass panels flank one treble panel to provide full range sound.|$|E
500|$|No Doubt {{embarked}} on the Tragic Kingdom Tour {{after the release}} of the album. It chose Project X, headed by Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling, to design the stage. No Doubt suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and <b>mylar</b> confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as [...] "a very kinetic performance". The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often strips of aluminum or <b>mylar</b> balloons, which can be packed in with the reentry vehicle (RV), adding little throw weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about [...] to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. Considering a large missile with multiple warheads, a summer 1961 staff report by ARPA suggested a single missile could require four entire Zeus batteries to defeat it, making the system impractical.|$|E
500|$|The KEF B110 SP1003 is a 110mm speaker with a doped Bextrene (a {{proprietary}} type of polystyrene copolymer) cone and a neoprene surround. The KEF T27 SP1032 has a 19mm <b>mylar</b> dome fitted and {{is with a}} perforated protection grille. The loudspeaker has {{an internal}} volume of approximately 5 litres. The speaker cabinet (loudspeaker enclosure) measuring , is made using [...] birch plywood strengthened at every joint with beech braces, and heavily damped. Although there was no specification for the wood of the original LS3/5 cabinets, the BBC closely specified wood types in defining the LS3/5A due to concerns that other hard woods â€“ specifically Parana pine, with which the BBC conducted tests â€“ would cause noticeable colouration (i.e. detract from sonic neutrality) due to interaction with a resonance of the bass drivers.|$|E
500|$|Falcon Acoustics {{was granted}} a licence by the BBC for the 15 ohm version of the LS3/5a in 2013 and {{commenced}} production in 2014 using drive units produced in-house by Falcon Acoustics. The Falcon F B110 bass unit is a re-engineered version using the same components of the original KEF B110 SP1003 with a doped Bextrene cone and a neoprene surround. The Falcon F T27 tweeter again uses the same components as the original KEF T27 SP1032 and has a 19mm <b>mylar</b> dome fitted. Both Falcon units were designed by Malcolm Jones who while employed at KEF between 1962 and 1974 {{was responsible for the}} design of the KEF B110 and T27 units originally used in the LS3/5 and LS3/5a. Both units are graded/selected to meet the BBC specification. Crossovers are close tolerance pair matched versions of the original BBC LS3/5a crossover design [...] using tapped transformers for high frequency adjustments.|$|E
500|$|Acoustical Manufacturing Company had {{launched}} a ribbon-hybrid, horn-loaded [...] "Corner Ribbon Loudspeaker" [...] in 1949, {{but this was}} not commercially successful. The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an electrostatic loudspeaker of his own; this was technologically enabled by the <b>Mylar</b> film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype electrostatic panel speaker (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency infinite baffle speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound Recording Association Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America â€” free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a <b>Mylar</b> bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture booksâ€”perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E
500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in <b>Mylar</b> curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna {{take you to a}} place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared on the stage and the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show â€“ Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground", and raised a rifle above her head. Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E
500|$|Wrapped {{and sealed}} in a {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) <b>Mylar</b> bag, Sex contains 128pages and is spiral bound with an aluminium cover {{that has the}} word [...] "Sex" [...] stamped {{in the middle and}} a warning label. The front page also shows Madonna against a sky blue backdrop. Three different types of paper were used for the printing of Sex and the design was overseen by Madonna and Baron & Baron Inc. (consisting of Fabien Baron and the photographer Siung Fat Tjia) who had previously collaborated with the singer designing the cover art of her fifth studio album, Erotica. As this was the first project for Maverick, the packaging was crucial; however Madonna did not have faith in Warner Book's [...] "mass-market" [...] publication process. Hence Baron suggested to transfer the packaging job to Nicholas Callaway's bespoke Callaway Editions. Charles Melcher, co-publisher with Callaway for the book, said that they usually did [...] "exquisite art books, $100 high end, beautiful things". But it was a challenge for them to process Madonna's ideas into reality. The artist wanted the packaging to be sealed, so that the reader had to tear it up and read. They considered various kinds of clasps before zeroing on the idea of the sealed bag as a reference to a condom package. The metal cover was Madonna's idea, who took the inspiration from the 1979 album, Metal Box by the band Public Image Ltd. Melcher recollects, [...] "We were talking about materials for the cover, and we went into her kitchen. [...] pointed at the metal plate {{at the back of her}} stove and said, 'I want something like this'. I was very impressed with the way she interacted with her world to source things." [...] The company bought about [...] of aluminium, a pound for each book. The designers had to do the front and the back covers, while rolling, stamping and ionizing the metal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Remo Belli and Sam Muchnick {{together}} {{developed a}} polymer head (also known as <b>Mylar)</b> {{leading to the}} development of the Remo drumhead company.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent testing, {{demonstrated}} that the charge transport model, while not perfect, is sound. [...] This testing also clarified that areas of indentation are less negatively charged than surrounding areas. [...] It is this relative difference in potential that causes the toner to be attracted to the areas of indentation, rather than other areas on the <b>mylar</b> surface.|$|E
2500|$|The Skyboy wing {{is built}} from {{aluminum}} extrusions for the spars and wing ribs {{and covered with}} doped aircraft fabric. The wing's leading edge is <b>Mylar</b> covered in fabric, to increase stiffness. The wing is supported by [...] "V" [...] struts and utilizes jury struts. The fuselage is built upon an aluminum main tube that runs from the tail right to the rudder pedals. The wings and horizontal tail surfaces can be folded for trailering or storage. The cabin is constructed from two fibreglass shells, joined together. The rear of the cabin is covered in aircraft fabric. The optional cabin doors open upwards.|$|E
2500|$|Sculpture: Warhol's {{most famous}} {{sculpture}} is probably his Brillo Boxes, silkscreened ink on wood {{replicas of the}} large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of Brillo soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist James Harvey. Warhol's sculpture {{was part of a}} series of [...] "grocery carton" [...] works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases. Other famous works include the Silver Cloudsâ€”helium filled, silver <b>mylar,</b> pillow-shaped balloons. A Silver Cloud was included in the traveling exhibition Air Art (1968â€“1969) curated by Willoughby Sharp. Clouds was also adapted by Warhol for avant-garde choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece RainForest (1968).|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation {{introduced}} keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of {{the first}} keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated <b>Mylar</b> plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other [...] "solid-state switch" [...] keyboards such as inductive and Hall-effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved, and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1969, {{the work}} was fully {{realized}} making use of the composerâ€™s color score as well as newly developed laser technology on loan from Yaleâ€™s Physics Department, by John Mauceri and the Yale Symphony Orchestra and designed by Richard N. Gould, who projected the colors into the auditorium that were reflected by the <b>Mylar</b> vests worn by the audience. The Yale Symphony repeated the presentation in 1971 [...] and brought the work to Paris that year for what was perhaps its Paris premiere at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs Ã‰lysÃ©es. The piece was reprised at Yale once again in 2010 ( [...] , who, with Justin Townsend, has published â€˜Scriabin and the Possibleâ€™).|$|E

2500|$|While {{the project}} was active, Ney and his {{coworkers}} carried out 313 major or experimental balloon flights, published 16 technical reports, and patented approximately 20 inventions. [...] The final report lists 62 major innovations and achievements. [...] The innovations include the duct appendix, the natural shape balloon, the Minnesota launch system, and the tetroon balloon design. [...] The last achievement listed was the post-project flight of a <b>mylar</b> tetroon on September 7, 1956, which reached a maximum height of 145,000 feet (44,000 m) over Minneapolis. [...] At the time, this was a record altitude for balloons, and there was considerable press coverage of the flight. [...] Most of the project's balloons were launched at the University of Minnesota Airport in New Brighton, Minnesota. [...] They were among more than 1000 flights launched here from 1948 until the airport was devastated by a tornado on May 6, 1965.|$|E
