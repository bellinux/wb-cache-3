40|$|Mechanical {{sensitivity}} of a quartz pressure-transducer type <b>microbarogram</b> is examined from simultaneous measurements of vertical motion and barometric pressure change by a co-located seismometer and barometers {{placed on a}} shake table. Our measurement confirms that, by simulating the period and amplitude of the Rayleigh waves of the 2003 Tokachi-Oki earthquake, the mechanical {{sensitivity of}} the microbarometer does not bias the observed pressure change during the 2003 Tokachi- Oki earthquake. ＜論説...|$|E
40|$|The fist major {{outbreak}} of tornadoes of the 1956 season {{took place on}} April 2 - 3, 1956. The majority of these fell in Kansas; however, nine were reported in Oklahoma including a particularly devastating tornado at Drumright, Okla., in the late evening of the 2 d [l]. The 1956 Severe Local Storms Research Network covers most of Oklahoma and Texas, and <b>microbarograms</b> from the network stations were examined covering the perjod of the tornado outbreaks. A well-defined pressure jump line was traced from the western limits of the network, the New Mexico-Texas border, at 1300 CST of the 2 d across the network to extreme eastern Texas at 0300 CST of April 3. The southern extremity of the line was limited by the southern boundary of the network (about Lat. 30 ” N.). The northern extent of t,he system wa...|$|R
