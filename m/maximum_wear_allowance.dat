According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint–casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for casing wear mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the wear depth, exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the casing wear process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the <b>maximum</b> casing <b>wear</b> depth with time was obtained.

Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the wear behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the wear behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real worn area in the wear scar, the change in the wear volume and the <b>maximum</b> <b>wear</b> depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the wear tests showed that the wear volume and the <b>maximum</b> <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the wear scar, it is possible to separate the size of the wear scar from the real worn area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the wear volume has a linear relation with the real worn area rather than the size of the wear scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the wear tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real worn area and the wear behavior at each spring shape...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA wear {{map shows}} wear rate as a {{function}} of the grid-to-rod gap size and the frequency of the excitation force. The critical gap size, which is associated with the <b>maximum</b> <b>wear</b> rate, lies within the harmonic regime. In the no wear region the amplitude of the rod vibration is smaller than the gap size so that no impact between the rod and plate can happen. The curve of the resonant frequency of the system appears to overlap with the peaks in the contour. Grid-to-rod fretting (GTRF) wear is a major cause of fuel leaks. Understanding its mechanism is crucial for improving the reliability of nuclear reactors. In this paper we present a three-dimensional, finite-element based approach, which reveals how the wear rate depends on the size of the gap between the grid and the fuel rod, and on the frequency of the excitation force. We show that these two factors affect the dynamic vibration of the rod, which leads to three different regimes: harmonic, period-doubling and chaotic. The wear rate in the harmonic regime is significantly larger than that in the other two regimes, and reaches a maximum when the excitation frequency is close to the resonant frequency of the system, which is dependent on the gap size. We introduce the concept of a critical gap size that gives the <b>maximum</b> <b>wear</b> rate, and we identify the properties and values of this critical gap size. A wear map is developed as a result of a large number of parametric studies.
