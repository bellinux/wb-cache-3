40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that some magazines targeted at young men – lads’ <b>mags</b> – are normalizing extreme sexist views by presenting those views in a mainstream context. Consistent with this view, young men in Study 1 (n= 90) identified more with derogatory quotes about women drawn from recent lads’ <b>mags,</b> and from interviews with convicted rapists, when those quotes were attributed to lads’mags, than when they were attributed to convicted rapists. In Study 2, 40 young women and men could not reliably judge the source of those same quotes. While these participants sometimes voiced {{the belief that the}} content of lads’ <b>mags</b> was ‘normal’ while rapists’ talk was ‘extreme’, they categorized quotes from both sources as derogatory with equal frequency. Jointly, the two studies show an overlap in the content of convicted rapists’ talk and the contents of contemporary lads’ <b>mags,</b> and suggest that the framing of such content within lads’ <b>mags</b> may normalize it for young men...|$|R

In 2012, JManga licensed and published the eight volumes digitally. The series has also been popularized under the name My Barbaric Girlfriend due to scanlations. Tokyopop's localized volumes appeared on ICv2's monthly top three-hundred selling graphic novels. English reviewers have praised the series' humor with mixed reaction to the plot and characters.|$|E

40|$|Social {{psychologists have}} argued that popular U. K. and U. S. men’s {{magazines}} known as “lads’ mags” have normalized hostile sexism among young men. Three studies develop this argument. First, a survey of 423 young U. K. men found that ambivalent sexism predicted attitudes toward the consumption of lads’ <b>mags,</b> but not other forms of direct sexual consumption (paying for sex or patronizing strip clubs). Second, Study 2 (N 81) found that young men low in sexism rated sexist jokes as less hostile toward women, but not as either funnier nor more ironic, when those jokes were presented within a lads’ <b>mags</b> context. These findings refute the idea that young men readily read lads’ mags’ sexism as ironic or “harmless fun. ” They show instead that placing sexist jokes in lads’ <b>mags</b> contexts makes them appear less hostile. The third study (N 275) demonstrated that young men perceived lads’ <b>mags</b> as less legitimate after attempting to distinguish the contents of lads’ <b>mags</b> from rapists’ legitimations of their crimes. Implications for contemporary studies of masculinities and consumption are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ <b>Mag,</b> and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radić Street exit.|$|E
5|$|The I-10 Reliever, a {{proposed}} east–west freeway, {{has been proposed}} {{in an effort to}} move some West Valley motorists off of I-10 in an attempt to decrease traffic along the frequently congested Interstate. Its western beginning would be at Route 85, and it would run east to encounter proposed Loop 303, and continue through to end at Loop 202's South Mountain Freeway (under construction as of 2017). Construction of the proposed Route 30 (former SR 801), would, if the freeway is approved, begin sometime in the early 2020s, based on funding and planning by the Maricopa Association of Governments. Following the approval of Interstate 11 in the 2012 Surface Transportation Act, a study for a Westward extension of SR30 to I-11 will be conducted by <b>MAG.</b>|$|E

In April 2006, he made his NJPW debut against El Samurai, using the ring name Prince Devitt. Devitt later stated in an interview with PowerSlam <b>Mag</b> that New Japan renamed him Prince Devitt because nobody Japanese could pronounce his actual name. He was originally going to be called King David, until people started questioning why the 24-year-old would be a king already. Eventually, Simon Inoki came up with the name Prince Devitt, which Devitt himself also preferred. In May 2006, New Japan started holding brandexclusive events, and Devitt was assigned to the Wrestle Land brand, debuting under a mask as the second Pegasus Kid, which led to comparisons between Devitt and the original Pegasus Kid, Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Sitric in the Irish Annals is in 917 {{when he and}} Ragnall, another grandson of Ímar, are described as leading their fleets to Ireland. Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Glúndub, overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. The Vikings fought against {{the men of the}} Uí Néill at <b>Mag</b> Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army. This was followed by another at the Battle of Confey (also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait), against Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster, who died in the battle. Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland. Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, where he established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria.|$|E
