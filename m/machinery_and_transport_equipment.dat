The contribution of Famagusta to the country's economic activity by 1974 far exceeded its proportional dimensions within the country. It possessed over 50% of the total hotel accommodation of Cyprus. Whilst its population was only about 7% of the total of the country, Famagusta by 1974 accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus, concentrating mainly on light industry compatible with its activity as a tourist resort and turning out high-quality products ranging from food, beverages and tobacco to clothing, footwear, plastics, light <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment.</b> It contributed 19.3% of the business units and employed 21.3% {{of the total number of}} persons engaged in commerce on the island.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the trends, prospects {{and challenges of}} Malaysia’s export market growth between 1990 - 2001 using the dynamic shift-share method. Two prevalent regional issues {{in the recent years}} that have been the concern of the policy makers in Malaysia have been investigated. First, realizing that Malaysia is highly dependent on its export as the engine of growth, the study analyzed the growth of each export product and international market access of these products at 2 -digit SITC level for four major categories of manufactured exports. The results indicated that overall, Malaysia has a strong net shift in the chemical (SITC 5) <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipments</b> (SITC 7) especially in office <b>machinery</b> (SITC 75) <b>and</b> electrical (SITC 77) products in the major markets. Secondly, due to the growing competition in international trade, the study also assessed the degree of competition between Malaysia, China and ASEAN- 4 countries exporting to the major markets. In general the results revealed that China and other ASEAN countries {{have an impact on the}} position of Malaysia as an exporter of manufactured products. It was concluded that China poses stiff challenges to Malaysia in the major markets such as EU, US and Japan.

40|$|O objetivo deste artigo é analisar a estrutura produtiva da economia paranaense enfatizando o papel das cooperativas agropecuárias no desenvolvimento do Estado nos anos de 1980, 1985, 1990 e 1995. A partir de tabelas de insumo-produto estimadas para o Paraná foi possível constatar que: i) nos anos de 1980 e 1985 o setor Cooperativa foi chave na economia estadual; ii) as cooperativas agropecuárias apresentaram, para todos os anos estudados, coeficientes técnicos de produção bastante similares aos das empresas não-cooperativas, mostrando que aquelas estão incorporando em seus processos produtivos o progresso tecnológico consolidado pelas não-cooperativas; iii) alguns setores da indústria de transformação, tais como Máquinas e Equipamentos, Material de Transporte e, em menor grau, Metalurgia e Material Elétrico/Eletrônico parecem emergir na economia paranaense; iv) a economia paranaense revelou maior diversificação da estrutura produtiva, crescimento das relações externas e, conseqüentemente, incremento da complexidade econômica.

As is common in other empirical work, international outsourcing is measured as imports in intermediate imports. Estimates using OLS first differences show that imported materials from the same industry originating from low-wage countries have a significant and negative impact on total employment. The estimates suggest that rising intermediate imports from low-wage countries may account for an approximate reduction of 0. 25 percentage points in employment per year. Sample split regressions show that {{the impact of}} imported materials from low-wage countries is statistically significant in industries with low skill intensity but not in skill intensive industries such as <b>machinery,</b> electrical, optical <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R

40|$|We collect {{extensive}} data on worldwide trade by transportation {{mode and}} {{use this to}} provide detailed comparisons of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with output versus international transportation of traded goods. International transport is responsible for 33 percent of world-wide trade-related emissions, and over 75 percent of emissions for major manufacturing categories like <b>machinery,</b> electronics <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment.</b> US exports intensively make use of air cargo; as a result two-thirds of its export-related emissions are due to international <b>transport,</b> <b>and</b> US exports by themselves generate a third of transport emissions worldwide. Inclusion of transport dramatically changes the ranking of countries by emission intensity. US production emissions per dollar of exports are 16 percent below the world average, but once we include transport US emissions per dollar exported are 59 percent above the world average. We use our data to systematically investigate whether trade inclusive of transport can lower emissions. In one-quarter of cases, the difference in output emissions {{is more than enough}} to compensate for the emissions cost of transport. Finally, we examine how likely patterns of trade growth will affect modal use and emissions. Full liberalization of tariffs and GDP growth concentrated in China and India lead to transport emissions growing much faster than the value of trade, due to trade shifting toward distant trading partners. Emissions growth from growing GDP dwarfs any growth from tariff liberalization. ...|$|R
