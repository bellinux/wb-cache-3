25|$|GS-X (1999) – Incorporated {{a setting}} table and ball {{accelerator}} redesign that reduced {{the amount of}} parts, the number of adjustments, {{and the amount of}} preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>required.</b> In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative <b>maintenance</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{transports}} {{always took}} off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports {{for a week or}} more at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of <b>maintenance</b> <b>required</b> to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.|$|E
500|$|Fresh water aboard Queen Mary 2 is {{supplied}} by three seawater desalination plants. The plants, {{each with a}} capacity of [...] per day, use multiple effect plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants' energy {{is supplied}} primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional multiple-effect distillation technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that scaling of plates is reduced, vastly reducing <b>maintenance</b> <b>required.</b> The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is [...] per day with a capacity of [...] {{so that there is}} ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants. Potable water tanks have a capacity of , enough for more than three days of supply. If the engines are running on low load (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution (brine) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines. An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit works.|$|E
2500|$|For example, Delta Airlines {{has reduced}} the number of flights it {{operates}} from the United States to Narita International Airport that are intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia. [...] Instead, Delta will utilize twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Total capacity will be cut, but consequentially load factors will increase. [...] In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400 aircraft and replace them either with Airbus A330 aircraft reassigned from cancelled international runs, or with new Airbus A350 aircraft now on order. [...] That will leave just six 747s flying for the airline in 2015. Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased <b>maintenance</b> <b>required</b> of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{topic of}} {{discussion}} {{was the type of}} technician(s) needed. As the hardware became more and more complex, the maintenance technicians needed broad as well as in-depth knowledge. Navy technicians would also be required to make rapid repairs on combat-critical equipment in locations where assistance from the outside – such as technical representatives of industries – would not be available. [...] Modular design, where a failure might be corrected by changing out a module, was not yet in use; thus, <b>maintenance</b> <b>required</b> detailed circuit tracing and knowledge of the circuit theory. It was agreed that the ideal situation would be to recruit persons with an electrical engineering (EE) or similar education and put them through the existing five-month advanced segment of the RMS to learn Navy hardware. This approach, however, was not practical; persons with this background were not only very limited in number but also in high demand by industry and the military.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ground floor}} of the new {{courthouse}} featured six offices each of which was heated with its own fireplace, a large room for Commissioners Court meetings, and a fire-proof vault for archiving county records. The second floor held the courtroom, more offices, a jury room, and a barred detention cell. A many-cupped chandelier lighted the courtroom from its high ceiling. At that time, the judge's bench was merely a flat-topped desk and chair. The half-story third floor served {{as little more than}} an attic with stairs leading to the clock tower. The 1910-model Seth Thomas clock with faces at each of the building's four sides was a pendulum-driven device constituted of metal-coated wooden gears and two rock-filled wooden boxes acting as weights. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>required</b> someone to climb three flights of steps plus two ladders weekly for winding. A [...] bell for striking the hours was also used as a fire signal and designated as an alert, if necessary, during the Mexican Revolution and World War II. The clock resulted in a $1,700 additional expense to the building despite problems with accuracy or even displaying the same time on its four faces. Installed shortly after the building was completed were hail screens to protect the windows and acetylene gas lights utilizing a pressurizing machine in the new jail yard. Although a water well was drilled in the jail yard, the courthouse did not have running water, toilets, or a septic tank until May 1914. Subsequently, a men's restroom was installed on the ground floor while a single women's toilet was placed in the second floor as women were not widely seen as participants in county government before passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|The King George Vs {{were the}} first British battleships to {{alternate}} engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power. The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the 8 machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit {{with a pair of}} engine rooms. Nominal full power was 110,000 shaft horsepower at 230 rpm with [...] steam at [...] The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of 125,000 shp and Prince of Wales [...] "...main machinery steamed at overload powers of 128,000 to 134,000 shaft horsepower with no difficulties..." [...] during the hunt for the Bismarck. The Admiralty boilers operated very efficiently and similar boilers of nearly identical power, fitted to [...] during her rebuilding in 1937, achieved a full power specific fuel consumption [...] of 0.748lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships. During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the <b>maintenance</b> <b>required.</b> [...] By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of oil sprayers and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, oil sprayers and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. These same oil sprayers and burners were used in [...] along with other detail improvements so that Vanguard achieved a full power specific fuel consumption of 0.63lb per shp while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the King George V class.|$|E
