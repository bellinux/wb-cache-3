The FIA is also the governing body for Formula One and other international motorsports.|$|E
5|$|Pryce's {{performances}} in a Formula One car earned him much respect amongst the F1 paddock. David Tremayne named his son after the Welshman. The Tom Pryce Award, {{also known as}} the Tom Pryce Trophy, was instigated, and is given annually to Welsh personalities who have made an outstanding contribution to <b>motoring</b> or transport.|$|E
5|$|Smithfield {{has also}} become a popular venue for {{sporting}} events. Until 2002 Smithfield hosted the midnight start of the annual Miglia Quadrato Car Rally, but with the increased night club activity around Smithfield the UHULMC (a <b>motoring</b> club) decided to move the event's start to Finsbury Circus. Since 2007, Smithfield has been the chosen location of an annual event dedicated to bike racing known as Smithfield Nocturne.|$|E
5|$|The E751 is {{considered}} to be of great importance for the economy and tourist industry of the region, as it links a large number of resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia, providing a significant access route for thousands of <b>motoring</b> tourists. Furthermore, two endpoints of the E751 are located {{in the vicinity of the}} two major Adriatic seaports of Rijeka and Koper.|$|E
5|$|The {{family had}} a modest income, and their {{situation}} became worse when Smith's father was injured in a <b>motoring</b> accident. Smith left school at 14 to join Billy Danter's Funfair, which toured extensively throughout the United Kingdom and also employed his father. He worked out of season as a farmhand, labourer and security guard.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} {{slowed to a}} halt. Private <b>motoring</b> had arrived {{to put an end}} to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E
5|$|From 1893 Dunhill ran {{a company}} selling <b>motoring</b> accessories, and in 1902 opened a shop in Mayfair. He {{developed}} a pipe designed for motorists in 1904. He opened a tobacconist's shop in St James's in 1907, offering tailored tobacco blends. Shops were opened in New York and Paris in the 1920s. With his international ambitions, Dunhill {{helped to create}} the modern luxury goods market. He retired from business in 1929, and married his mistress in 1945, {{following the death of}} his wife.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 2009, Schumacher {{appeared}} on the BBC's <b>motoring</b> programme Top Gear as the Stig. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, and the BBC has since confirmed {{that this is the}} case. Schumacher was there on that occasion because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the one-of-a-kind black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show. The FXX was presented to Schumacher upon his retirement at Monza in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Police District has {{a series}} of special {{divisions}} and task forces which provide aid to all other police districts when necessary. It {{is responsible for the}} two police helicopters, which is mostly used for traffic <b>motoring,</b> search and rescue and apprehension. The Emergency Response Unit is a deployment unit for terrorism, sabotage and hostage incidents, which is separate from the crisis and hostage negotiation service. Oslo's dog patrol service includes the national bomb squad. The departments further has a mobile deployment squad against demonstrations and riots, a Police Negotiation Unit for use against barricades and kidnapping, a mounted police, and the responsibility for protecting high-ranking government and royal officials.|$|E
5|$|The E751 {{route is}} of great {{importance}} for economy and tourist industry of Istria and Slovenian Littoral, as it links {{a large number of}} resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia, providing a significant access route for thousands of <b>motoring</b> tourists. These resorts include Brijuni National Park, Fažana, Rovinj, Poreč, Novigrad, Umag, Piran and Portorož {{on either side of the}} Croatian–Slovenian border. Furthermore, two endpoints of the E751 are located in vicinity of two major Adriatic seaports: the Port of Rijeka and the Port of Koper.|$|E
5|$|The Skyfleet S570 {{aircraft}} in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner. The plane used {{can be seen on}} the BBC <b>motoring</b> programme Top Gear on the Test Track.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{disapproval of}} the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia {{and her mother}} {{to move into the}} Royal Palace on {{condition}} that the marriage remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while <b>motoring</b> near Fontainebleau, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car, while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous <b>motoring</b> behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1985, the C5 was {{unveiled}} at a glitzy launch event but it received {{a less than}} enthusiastic reception from the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and <b>motoring</b> organisations. The vehicle's limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only , a battery that ran down quickly {{and a lack of}} weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won <b>motoring</b> awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|With the popularisation of {{the motor}} car, {{it was found that}} plowing alone was {{insufficient}} for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of gritting vehicles, which used sodium chloride to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of <b>motoring</b> accidents increased, the protests subsided {{and by the end of}} the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. As environmental awareness increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.|$|E
5|$|London {{became the}} largest and most populous {{metropolitan}} area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage. Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies. Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies. At the end of the Phoney War, Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential patterns were altered in England by private <b>motoring,</b> and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local <b>motoring</b> magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
