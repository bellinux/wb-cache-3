25|$|South African National Standard 10019:2008 {{specifies}} {{the colour}} of all scuba cylinders as Golden yellow with French gray shoulder. This {{applies to all}} underwater breathing gases except <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen,</b> which must be carried in cylinders that are Black with a White shoulder. Nitrox cylinders must be identified by a transparent, self-adhesive label with green lettering, fitted below the shoulder. In effect this is green lettering on a yellow cylinder, with a gray shoulder. The composition of the gas must also be specified on the label. In practice this is done by a small additional self-adhesive label with the oxygen fraction, which is changed when a new mix is filled.|$|E

50|$|<b>Medical</b> plastic <b>oxygen</b> {{masks are}} used {{primarily}} by medical care providers for oxygen therapy {{because they are}} disposable and so reduce cleaning costs and infection risks. Mask design can determine accuracy of oxygen delivered with many various medical situations requiring treatment with oxygen. Oxygen is naturally occurring in room air at 21% and higher percentages are often essential in <b>medical</b> treatment. <b>Oxygen</b> in these higher percentages is classified as a drug with too much oxygen being potentially harmful to a patient's health, resulting in oxygen dependence over time, and in extreme circumstances patient blindness. For these reasons oxygen therapy is closely monitored. Masks are light in weight and attached using an elasticated headband or ear loops. They are transparent for allowing the face to be visible for patient assessment by healthcare providers, and reducing a sensation of claustrophobia experienced by some patients when wearing an oxygen mask. The vast majority of patients having an operation will at some stage wear an oxygen mask; they may alternatively wear a nasal cannula but oxygen delivered {{in this way is}} less accurate and restricted in concentration.|$|R
50|$|In commerce, {{liquid oxygen}} is {{classified}} as an industrial gas and is widely used for industrial and <b>medical</b> purposes. Liquid <b>oxygen</b> is obtained from the oxygen found naturally in air by fractional distillation in a cryogenic air separation plant.|$|R

5000|$|Divox [...] is {{breathing}} grade oxygen labelled for diving use. In the Netherlands, pure oxygen for breathing purposes {{is regarded}} as medicinal as opposed to industrial oxygen, such as that used in welding, and is only available on medical prescription. The diving industry registered Divox as a trademark for breathing grade oxygen to circumvent the strict rules concerning medicinal oxygen thus {{making it easier for}} (recreational) scuba divers to obtain oxygen for blending their breathing gas.In most countries, there is no difference in purity in <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen</b> and industrial oxygen, as they are produced by exactly the same methods and manufacturers, but labeled and filled differently.

5000|$|Hospitals in some jurisdictions, {{such as the}} UK, now operate [...] "no-smoking" [...] policies, which {{although}} introduced {{for other}} reasons, support the aim of keeping ignition sources away from <b>medical</b> piped <b>oxygen.</b> Recorded sources of ignition of medically prescribed oxygen include candles, aromatherapy, medical equipment, cooking, and unfortunately, deliberate vandalism. Smoking of pipes, cigars and cigarettes is of special concern. These policies do not entirely eliminate the risk of injury with portable oxygen systems, especially if compliance is poor.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen {{concentrators}} {{are considered}} sufficiently foolproof {{to be supplied}} to individual patients as a prescription item for use in their homes.

50|$|Non-medical oxygen {{concentrators}} {{can be used}} as a feed gas to a <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, such as the oxygen system in a hospital, though governmental approval is required, such as by the FDA, and additional filtering is generally required.|$|E
50|$|Home <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{concentrators}} {{were invented}} in the early-1970s. Manufacturing output {{of these devices}} increased in the late 1970s. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and Bendix Corporation were both early manufacturers. Prior to that era, home <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen</b> therapy required the use of heavy high pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment (DME) industry to rapidly embrace concentrators {{as a way to}} control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially {{as a result of this}} change. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) invented molecular sieve in the 1950s which made these devices possible. UCC also invented the first cryogenic liquid home <b>medical</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Hyperbaric {{medicine}} includes hyperbaric oxygen treatment, {{which is}} the <b>medical</b> use of <b>oxygen</b> at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body; and therapeutic recompression, which involves increasing the ambient pressure on a person, usually a diver, to treat decompression sickness or an air embolism by eliminating bubbles that have formed within the body.|$|R
5000|$|Extrication {{includes}} patient assessment, {{treatment and}} {{removal of the}} patient from vehicle. Some departments only carry with them minimal tools such as one set of jaws of life and are only capable of simply [...] "popping" [...] a door off and then must step away to allow the medical rescuers in or to allow a more dedicated heavy rescue team in who has more equipment. Extrication units are supposed to not only have {{many different kinds of}} extrication tools, but <b>medical</b> equipment, <b>oxygen,</b> and backboards as well. Extrication is the entire process from fire protection, power unit disengagement, vehicle security, patient security and treatment, removal of vehicle from patient, removal of patient, and transfer to ambulance. Extrication is not just simply popping a door off.|$|R

There are back-up generators with built-in power redundancies that allow for 10 days of 100% power, independent of the grid; an advanced ventilation system that blocks potentially contaminated air from reaching beyond the rooms of infectious patients; a system that allows the hospital to create its own <b>medical</b> grade <b>oxygen</b> by pulling {{it out of the}} air and distilling it in-house; an automated air-conditioning that cuts energy consumption costs by monitoring foot traffic and only gives air where needed; and a solar farm that reduces the hospital's energy consumption by almost 50%.|$|R
