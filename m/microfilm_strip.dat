5000|$|Jerald and Sandra Tanner, {{critics of}} the Church, {{obtained}} an unauthorized copy of a <b>microfilm</b> <b>strip</b> containing images of the documents in 1966, and published them as Joseph Smith's Egyptian Alphabet & Grammar. This publication was criticized in a BYU Studies article by Hugh Nibley in 1971 {{because it did not}} contain all of the manuscripts, and included no critical apparatus to aid readers in distinguishing one manuscript from another. Nibley's article included images of ten of the manuscript pages. [...] The Tanner publication was revised and updated by H. Michael Marquardt in 1981. Marquardt added a critical apparatus and some interpretive material. A new critical edition of the Book of Abraham manuscripts by Brian M. Hauglid appeared in 2011, with a second volume planned to publish the remainder of the KEP.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. military's V-mail {{was based}} on British Airgraphs, which were based on Eastman Kodak's patent {{obtained}} from New York City banker George McCarthy. Prior to that, a similar system was deployed during the Franco-Prussian War which used carrier pigeons to send primitive <b>microfilm</b> <b>strips</b> across German lines, developed from French optician Ren√© Dagron's first patent granted for microfilm in 1859. Dagron's microfilm patent was additionally based on British scientist John Benjamin Dancer, who created microfilm in 1839.|$|R
