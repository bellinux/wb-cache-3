Each cruise had 2 phases, a northern phase over the Patagonian Shelf edge and adjacent waters, and a southern phase over the shelf around the Falkland Islands. Vertical temperature profiles were used to identify the major fronts and water masses. The subtropical water of the Brazil Current was characterized by the tropical/subtropical Abraliopsis pfefferi and Histioteuthis corona corona, the subtropical/subantarctic H. atlantica and the widespread Taningia danae, species of Brachioteuthis, Chiroteuthis and Galiteuthis, a single specimen of Illex argentinus and an ommastrephid rhynchoteuthion type B.

40|$|A {{scientific}} research fishing expedition targeting the oceanic/slope ommastrephid squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> was undertaken by a Korean-registered squid jigger in CCAMLR area 48. 3, near South Georgia, in June 1996, providing {{the first opportunity}} {{to collect data on}} the fishery biology of this species during the austral winter. Fishing took place over a period of 8 days; a series of eight drifts was undertaken along an approximately east/west transect of about 200 nautical miles to the north and west of South Georgia, over depths ranging from 1, 700 to 2, 713 [*]m. All fishing was to the south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Data were collected on sea surface temperature, catch per unit of effort, size, sex, maturity status and stomach contents of the catch and a sample of squid was aged by counting putative, daily microgrowth increments in the sectioned statolith. All squid were caught by jigs operating at depths from 80 to 100 [*]m to the surface. Catch per unit of effort per drift varied between 1. 0 and 21. 9 [*]kg[*]min− 1 and there was no by-catch. Greatest numbers of squid were caught at dusk and dawn. Mantle length fell in the range 220 – 350 [*]mm (males) and 212 – 370 [*]mm (females). Most males were sexually mature (Lipinski's stages IV–V) and most females were immature (stage II). The absence of mature females suggests that no spawning takes place in this area during the austral winter. The squid were up to 1 ␣year of age and had hatched during the previous winter. They were apparently from the same cohort as had been sampled at the Antarctic Polar Front in February 1996. Myctophids were the major prey in the stomach contents and the squid Gonatus antarcticus was also important; crustaceans were relatively unimportant.

40|$|Recent {{data from}} {{research}} cruises and explorator {{fishing in the}} Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) of the Scotia Sea, together with data from dietary studies of Antarctic vertebrate predators, have revealed a large, previously overlooked trophic system in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 1). The upper trophic levels of this open-ocean epipelagic community are exceptional in that they contain no fish species. Fishes are replaced by cephalopods, including the ommastrephid squid, <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi.</b> This squid preys on mesopelagic m. yctophids (lanternfish), which feed largely on copepods. We identify here a geographically distinct, Antarctic, open-ocean food chain which is of importance to air breathing predator species but where Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is absent. This system is probably prevalent in areas of higher primary productivity, especially the Scotia Sea and near the peri-Antarctic islands.

40|$|Assessing the {{consumption}} of prey by predators in the marine environment is key to fisheries assessment and management. Although environmental and ecological variations can affect {{the consumption}} of certain prey by albatrosses interannually, this issue has not been addressed to date. In the present study, the interannual consumption of cephalopods by grey-headed and black-browed albatrosses was assessed while breeding at South Georgia between 1996 and 2000, by comparing consumption estimates from a reparameterised version of the South Georgia Seabird Impact Assessment (SGSIA) model. The reparameterised model showed that there are considerable interannual variations in cephalopod consumption in both albatross species, with the highest consumption occurring in 1996 (5787 tonnes; for black-browed albatrosses) and 1997 (11 627 tonnes; for grey-headed albatrosses), and the lowest in 2000 (2309 tonnes and 772 tonnes for grey-headed and black-browed albatrosses respectively). These interannual variations were linked to oceanographic conditions and changes in cephalopod abundance/availability to predators. The cephalopod species with the most commercial potential (<b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi,</b> Kondakovia longimana, Moroteuthis knipovitchi and Gonatus antarcticus) also showed considerable differences in their consumption by predators.

40|$|Acoustic {{survey methods}} are now widely used for stock {{assessments}} of finfish, both those {{with and without}} swimbladders, but their application to squid stocks has been limited in the past, probably because squid are not particularly strong targets for detection with echosounders. Experience with acoustic stock assessment of krill (Euphausia superba) has revealed {{that it is possible}} to survey effectively for a species that is a weaker target than squid; this is partly due to the tendency for krill to form dense aggregations. This paper discusses examples of acoustic studies on different squid species from the South Atlantic (Loligo gahi, <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi)</b> and demonstrates that squid detection is possible in widely differing locations. L. gahi observed during a survey on the Falkland Shelf were shown to have acoustic characteristics in common with smaller organisms which may enable them to be distinguished acoustically from finfish encountered in these waters. When a species has been characterised acoustically, the technique permits rapid surveys of large areas to determine the geographic range of a population, both outside the usual area that can be surveyed using fishing methods and within areas that are inaccessible to nets for some reason. ...|$|E

The 1984 sample was taken during a season characterised by abnormal local oceanographic conditions in which the breeding success was very low; in 1986 conditions were normal and breeding success was high. Cephalopod beaks (289 from adults; 5 651 from chicks) were identified, and allometric equations were used to estimate the biomass represented. Five cephalopod species belonging to five families (Gonatidae, Onychoteuthidae, Psychroteuthidae, Ommastrephidae and Cranchiidae) contributed 98 % by number and 97 % of the biomass fed to chicks. The most important species was the ommastrephid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi,</b> contributing 68. 9 to 77. 4 % by number and 72. 5 to 79. 3 % of the total biomass fed to chicks.

The squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> predominated in the diet samples in 2001 and 2002 (89 % and 81 % of reconstituted mass), but was absent from the 2000 samples. Reconstituted mean mass per sample in 2000 was significantly lower than in 2001 and 2002. Chick growth rate during 2000 was also the lowest recorded. This suggests that M hyadesi {{plays an important role in}} the breeding performance of grey-headed albatrosses at Diego Ramirez. Low presence of M hyadesi in grey-headed albatrosses' diet at South Georgia in 2000, a year with significant low breeding success, suggests ocean-wide processes affecting the availability of this prey to both populations simultaneously. Overlap in diet composition, and inferred feeding areas, between the sympatric albatross species at Diego Ramirez was minimal.

The issues include the fundamental influence of oceanographic variability on population variability, and the importance of a thorough understanding of the lifecycle of the study species in order to detect and understand the relationships between it and the environment. The importance of understanding the relative temporal and spatial scales on which the environmental and biological factors interact is also considered.

Data were analysed {{in relation to}} the bathymetry and sea-surface temperature of the foraging zones. Black-browed albatrosses spent 55 % of their time on the Campbell Plateau but also carried out long foraging trips to the Polar Front and Antarctic Zone at a distance of over 2000 km. They relied heavily on juvenile Micromesistius australis, a schooling fish, during foraging trips to the shelf but over oceanic waters the squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> was the main prey taken. Grey-headed albatrosses spent 71 % of their time foraging over the deep waters of the Polar Frontal Zone where M. hyadesi comprised over 90 % of the mass of prey taken. No satellite-tracked birds fed over the shelf, but data from the duration of foraging trips and dietary analysis suggests that shelf-feeding is important for this species. Significant inter-species differences in the time spent in neritic and oceanic zones show that black-browed albatrosses are reliant primarily on shelf resources while grey-headed albatrosses are primarily oceanic feeders. In addition, the 2 species overlapped little in the zones used over oceanic waters, with black-browed albatrosses feeding in more southerly waters than grey-headed albatrosses.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{collecting}} and analyzing boluses {{to characterize the}} cephalopod diet of albatrosses {{has been used in}} many diet studies. However, no study has validated this method. We compared boluses and stomach samples from Gray-headed Albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma) and Black-browed Albatrosses (T. melanophris) to (1) study the consumption and diversity of cephalopods in these species, (2) investigate biases associated with each sampling method, and (3) estimate the number of samples needed to characterize these albatross’s cephalopod diet. We found that collection and analysis of boluses is a simple, efficient, and noninvasive method for assessing the cephalopod diet of these albatross species, but it is inadequate for characterizing the more easily digestible dietary components, such as fish and crustaceans. Both boluses and stomach samples showed that the two albatross species fed on cephalopods of similar sizes and from the same families (Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, and Cranchiidae). Furthermore, the main prey species (<b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi,</b> Kondakovia longimana, and Galiteuthis glacialis) and the total number of cephalopod species consumed (18 – 24 species) were the same for both albatrosses. To include all cephalopod species, using a sample-randomization technique, a minimum of 61 and 43 boluses were needed for Gray-headed and Black- browed albatrosses, respectively; but to adequately describe the diversity and size frequency of the main prey species, 82 and 371 boluses would be needed...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} {{a range of}} foraging strategies adopted by grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma rearing chicks at Bird Island, South Georgia, by simultaneously using satellite telemetry, wet/dry activity recorders and stomach temperature loggers. The albatrosses foraged mostly over oceanic waters, probably associated with the Polar Front north of South Georgia, and also over shelf-slope waters around the Antarctic Peninsula. After leaving the colony, birds commuted to areas with predictable prey concentrations, where they remained for several days. During search periods, birds landed more often and had a higher intake rate, but spent the same proportion of time in flight as on commuting days. Although intake rates were particularly high in shelf-break waters around the Antarctic Peninsula (only one individual foraged in this area), prey were also consumed in reasonable quantities during commuting flights. While at sea, birds spent most (81 %) of the day flying, and most (94 %) of the night resting on the water. A considerable proportion (26 % by mass) of prey was consumed during darkness. The majority of prey were detected and captured during search flights, but 35 % were located while sitting on the sea surface. Many ingestion events (up to 27 % of the overall food intake) showed temperature signatures characteristic of fluids, suggesting that albatrosses may feed on gelatinous and rapidly digested prey (e. g. salps and jellyfish) much more often than previously suspected.

40|$|The diets of six of {{the main}} seabird species (two petrels, two albatrosses, two penguins) {{breeding}} at Bird Island, South Georgia were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period in 1986. For five species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main food (39 – 98 % by mass); grey-headed albatrosses took mainly the ommastrephid squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> (71 %) and only 16 % krill. The size of the krill taken was similar between seabird species, although there were small but significant differences between penguins and the other species. Sex and reproductive status of krill, however, was different between all seabird species, reflecting some combination of differences in foraging ranges, selectivity by predators, or differences in escape responses of krill. For the krill-eating species, {{the rest of the}} diet varied substantially between species, comprising Martialia and nototheniid fish (blackbrowed albatross and, along with lanternfish, white-chinned petrel), lanternfish and amphipods (Antarctic prion and macaroni penguin), and icefish (gentoo penguin). Long-term data on breeding success and information on diet in 5 – 10 other years suggest that in 1986 seabird diet and reproductive performance was indicative of a year of good availability of krill around South Georgia. In such circumstances, ecological segregation between krill-eating species appears to be maintained chiefly by differences in foraging range and feeding methods, which are reviewed.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to enhance the {{knowledge}} of the feeding habits of the juvenile component of the population of Southern elephant seals [Mirounga leonina (Linnaeus, 1758) ] from Isla 25 de Mayo, South Shetland Islands, age class whose diet information is scarce. A total of 60 individuals were stomach lavaged in the spring- summer seasons of three consecutive years (2003, 2004 and 2005) of which 53. 3 % (n = 32) presented food remnants. The Antarctic glacial squid Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, 1921 was the dominant prey taxon in terms of frequency of occurrence (68. 7 %), numerical abundance (60. 1 %) and biomass (51. 5 %), contributing 84. 1 % to the total relative importance index. Other squid prey species of importance were Slosarczykovia circumantartica Lipinski, 2001 in terms of occurrence (37. 5 %) and numerical abundance (14 %) and Moroteuthis knipovitchi Filippova, 1972 in terms of biomass (16 %).

No significant differences in the sizes of P. glacialis preyed upon by elephant seals were found between sexes and years. However, significant interannual differences were found in the taxonomical composition of their diet. This would be associated with temporal changes in food availability at the foraging areas of seals, which in turn may have been influenced by changes in oceanographic conditions as a result of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon that occurred during part of the study period.

M. hyadesi is an ecologically important South Atlantic ommastrephid squid and it is probable that, in the future, fishing effort will be increasingly directed towards this species. Details regarding the population structure of the species are therefore required. In comparison with the other three samples of M. hyadesi, one of the samples from the Patagonian Shelf (PAT 89 II) exhibited fixed allelic differences at 16 of the 39 enzyme loci which were resolved (genetic identity, I= 0. 51). This high level of genetic differentiation contradicts the apparent morphological similarity between samples, indicating {{the presence of a}} cryptic or sibling congeneric species. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and significant differences in allele distribution were also detected within and between the other three putative M. hyadesi samples, suggesting that the species fails to maintain effective panmixia across its geographical range. The occurrence of both temporal (1986 cf. 1989) and geographic structuring within the species complex is consequently indicated, caused possibly by an overlap of reproductively isolated stocks (stock mixing) outside their respective breeding areas. Low levels of genetic variability were detected throughout the samples examined, estimates of average heterozygosity per locus within the two species detected being in the order of 0. 01 and 0. 002.

Between the two summers of the study there were some changes in the relative importance of the various cephalopod species consumed; in particular, in 1988 – 1989 M. knipovitchi and M. hyadesi were less important and P. glacialis was more important. The taxa and size of cephalopods taken by southern elephant seals at South Georgia are almost identical to those taken by the grey-headed albatross (Diomedea chrysostoma), but the relative proportions are quite different. The biogeography of the cephalopods eaten suggests that southern elephant seals sampled at South Georgia do not forage {{to the north of the}} Antarctic Polar Front but probably travel southwards towards the Antarctic continent or Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|<b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> were {{collected}} from fishing vessels at the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) and the Patagonian Shelf Edge (PASE) during the 1989 austral autumn and winter. Squid were measured, weighed, assigned a maturity stage and the paired statoliths were removed. Statolith sections revealed concentric growth rings using light and scanning electron microscopy. Counts of these putative daily micro-growth increments were made directly and by an estimating procedure. Energy dispersive (ED) and wavelength dispersive (WD) x-ray analyses of Sr and Ca content were made on subsamples of statolith sections. Estimated increment counts, which were generally higher than direct counts, were adopted for routine application. Back calculated hatching dates showed that a single cohort, with a relatively narrow size range, was sampled in each geographical area. Back calculations suggested that M. hyadesi at the APFZ had hatched in the austral winter and those at the PASE had hatched in the spring. At the PASE, growth rate {{was estimated to be}} some 30 % higher than at the APFZ and PASE squid were more mature at a given age. The hypothesis that the Sr:Ca ratio along the growth axis of the statolith contains information on thermal history was examined. Sr:Ca ratios in the statolith fell in the range 0. 009 – 0. 017 and varied systematically but this variation did not apparently relate to season and ratios were not significantly different between geographical areas. A consistent feature was a relatively low Sr:Ca ratio at the time of hatching. According to the Sr:Ca thermometer hypothesis this is consistent with spawning in relatively warm water but it could equally be due to depositional differences during early statolith growth. The Sr:Ca thermometer hypothesis could neither be confirmed nor rejected by the data but there is evidence that strontium varies systematically with age in the squid statolith...|$|E
40|$|The {{foraging}} {{areas and}} diets of the grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans were studied in March/April 2000 at Bird Island, South Georgia, during their respective chick-rearing and brood-guard periods. Oceanographically, March/April 2000 was abnormal, with warm conditions close to South Georgia. These conditions affected albatross foraging behaviour, particularly that of grey-headed albatrosses. Both species tended to forage {{in different areas}} of the ocean, with significant differences in trip durations. Grey-headed albatrosses (n = 9) foraged mainly in Antarctic waters (predominantly shelf waters of the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula, and also in oceanic waters around South Georgia), feeding mainly on krill (Euphausia superba; 77 % by mass). Foraging trips lasted 13. 3 days (range: 5 - 26 days), far longer than the 1 - 3 days found in previous studies. Only one grey-headed albatross was associated with the APF (Antarctic Polar Front), a reported foraging area in recent studies. Wandering albatrosses (n= 9) foraged in Antarctic (South Georgia Shelf) and Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) waters, with trips of 1 - 4 days trip duration (usual for this species), feeding on fish (46 % by mass) and cephalopods (32 %). One bird was associated with the APF, and two birds foraged on the shelf/shelf break over the Patagonian shelf. These findings suggest that sea surface temperature anomalies, produced by movement of the APF closer to South Georgia or by eddies, may have had an effect on the foraging strategy of greyheaded albatrosses that year (the main prey of grey-headed albatrosses in previous studies, the omma-strephid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi,</b> is known {{to be associated with the}} APF). Also, when both albatross breeding periods overlap, their foraging areas were complementary, which reflected the prey taken...|$|E
40|$|The beaks of 10 {{cephalopod}} {{species were}} found in the diet of foraging and moulting king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) from a breeding colony at Volunteer Beach, Falkland Islands during austral winter (September/October 1996). A total of 486 lower cephalopod beaks were collected, identified and measured (LRL: lower rostral length). Six cephalopod families occurred in the penguins’ diet with Onychoteuthidae being the most abundant (256 lower beaks) and represented by Moroteuthis ingens (168; LRL range 2. 1 – 6. 8 mm), Moroteuthis knipovitchi (79; LRL range 1. 9 – 5. 5 mm), and Kondakovia longimana (9; LRL range 2. 1 – 7. 4 mm). Other families were Ommastrephidae (135) with <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> (127; LRL range 2. 6 – 8. 7 mm), Illex argentinus (6; LRL range 5. 0 – 6. 0 mm), and Ommastrephes bartrami (2; LRL range 7. 9 – 8. 8 mm); Loliginidae with Loligo gahi (60; LRL range 0. 8 – 2. 1 mm); Gonatidae with Gonatus antarcticus (28; LRL range 1. 3 – 3. 3 mm); Neoteuthidae with Alluroteuthis antarcticus (4; LRL range 2. 4 – 3. 9 mm), and Histioteuthidae with Histioteuthis eltaninae (3; LRL range 3. 3 – 3. 4 mm). Allometric equations were used to relate lower rostral beak length with cephalopod body size and mass. M. ingens was the dominating cephalopod prey in terms of numbers (n= 168), whereas M. hyadesi was most important in terms of biomass (64 682 g). The present study provides first information on the cephalopod prey of Falkland Islands king penguins. The data suggest that penguins take squid at coastal islands slope regions as well as in oceanic waters which demonstrates their ability to forage in a wide geographical area and to alternate between specific foraging sites. Possible competition with the commercial squid fishery off the Falkland Islands is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Predator {{data and}} {{exploratory}} {{fishing in the}} Scotia Sea have revealed the presence of cephalopod stocks in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). This is a vast, remote region where large epipelagic cephalopods aggregate into highly mobile schools making them difficult to locate and sample. We used satellite tagged predators and shipboard acoustics for coarse and fine scale location of cephalopod concentrations, and sampled them with commercial and scientific nets to determine the relationship between cephalopod distribution and mesoscale oceanographic features at the PFZ. Satellite tags were attached to 9 grey-headed albatrosses Diomedea chrysostoma, breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, to monitor foraging at sea in January-March 1994. A foraging area at the PFZ, north of South Georgia, was located, an acoustic survey undertaken and a fixed station established where acoustic targets were found. A net survey was carried out with a commercial pelagic trawl, a rectangular midwater trawl 25 m 2 (RMT 25), a horizontal multiple plankton sampler and a neuston net. Acoustic layers were targeted and the RMT 25 sampled 200 m layers to 1000 m in daylight and darkness. Cephalopods were simultaneously recovered from food samples fed to D. chrysostoma chicks at Bird Island. Two CTD transects, approximately normal to the major current flow, were undertaken across the PFZ and remote-sensed sea-surface temperature images from NOAA polar orbiting satellites were obtained aboard ship. The pelagic trawl sampled a cephalopod community that closely resembled that exploited by D. chrysostoma. The largest and most conspicuous species was the ommastrephid squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> {{which is the most}} important cephalopod prey species. Net-sampled M. hyadesi had been feeding on crustaceans and mesopelagic fish. The cephalopod community was sampled in a feature, interpreted as a warm core ring, in an area characterised by mesoscale features associated with the bathymetry of the northern end of the Northeast Georgia Rise and near a gap in the Falkland Ridge. The association of these mesoscale features with the bathymetry suggests that they may be predictable foraging locations for the cephalopods and their predators...|$|E
40|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the development of}} a new fishery for the ommastrephid squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> in the Scotia Sea, this paper presents a revision of annual consumption of the species by higher predators and provides a brief review of information about the life cycle and distribution of the species obtained from research fishing and commercial catches. This species is eaten by seals, whales and seabirds, the latter being the most reliable source of consumption data because comprehensive sampling can be carried out during their breeding seasons. A conservative estimate for total annual consumption of M. hyadesi by higher predators in the Scotia Sea is 245 000 tonnes, with an upper estimate of 550 000 tonnes if less reliable data are included. M. hyadesi spawns between autumn and mid-summer with peak hatching in winter/spring. Its life span has not been established. Data from the CCAMLR Convention Area suggest that M. hyadesi may live for two years, but this may vary. In common with other ommastrephids, the species is probably semelparous. It is proposed that the timing and catches of the fishery should be highly conservative and set taking into account the timing of breeding and consumption rates of the most sensitive of the dependent species. Most Antarctic predators which have been studied consume relatively small and immature specimens of M. hyadesi. Fishing for M. hyadesi after the chick-rearing period of the most sensitive predator (grey-headed albatross) would minimise competition locally and ensure that the fishery only exploited the stock after escapement from most higher predator species. It would also allow seabird predation of the stock to be monitored prior to the fishing season as a way of assessing numbers of pre-recruits. Closing the fishery before recruitment of the next generation of squid would ensure availability of prey to higher predators during the following chick-rearing period. Preliminary data from a squid jigger which undertook research fishing around South Georgia in June 1996 provided the basis for determining realistic potential catch rates...|$|E
40|$|The seven star {{flying squid}} <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> is an oceanic slope ommastrephid with a {{circumpolar}} distribution {{associated with the}} Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) and is a minor, variable catch in the South Atlantic Illex argentinus fishery. There have been occasional unusually large catches of M. hyadesi, the latest being in 1995. Because {{of the importance of}} understanding the influence of the physical environment on fisheries for oceanic squid, and interest in developing a new fishery for M. hyadesi in the CCAMLR area, we examined specimens and data from the 1995 season and analysed 10 yr fisheries and remotely sensed oceanographic data sets from the area. The 1995 data show that M. hyadesi remains in the cool APFZ waters of the Falkland Current where it preys on oceanic fish and crustaceans and its distribution rarely extends over the Patagonian Shelf. The squid exploited by the fishery in 1995 were 6 to 12 mo old; females were immature but some males were fully mature. A remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) image revealed mesoscale features at the shelf break front between Patagonian Shelf water and APFZ water where the squid were caught. The appearance of M. hyadesi in the fishery over the last decade, including 1995, has been related to SST anomalies. Teleconnections probably exist between these anomalies, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific and sub-decadal oceanographic instability in the Antarctic. Squid are short-lived and populations are {{likely to be able to}} respond rapidly to environmental change. However, it is not clear at what stage in the life cycle of M. hyadesi these oceanographic events exert their effect. We propose 2 alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses. Warm events prior to the appearance of M. hyadesi may favour reproductive success of the parent generation giving rise to a strong recruitment, or alternatively this cool water species may extend its range to the edge of the Patagonian Shelf early in the development of cold oceanographic events. In either case oceanographic effects are probably mediated via the squid's prey...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to enhance the {{knowledge}} of the feeding habits of the juvenile component of the population of Southern elephant seals [Mirounga leonina (Linnaeus, 1758) ] from Isla 25 de Mayo, South Shetland Islands, age class whose diet information is scarce. A total of 60 individuals were stomach lavaged in the spring - summer seasons of three consecutive years (2003, 2004 and 2005) of which 53. 3 % (n = 32) presented food remnants. The Antarctic glacial squid Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, 1921 was the dominant prey taxon in terms of frequency of occurrence (68. 7 %), numerical abundance (60. 1 %) and biomass (51. 5 %), contributing 84. 1 % to the total relative importance index. Other squid prey species of importance were Slosarczykovia circumantartica Lipinski, 2001 in terms of occurrence (37. 5 %) and numerical abundance (14 %) and Moroteuthis knipovitchi Filippova, 1972 in terms of biomass (16 %). All identified cephalopod prey taxa are distributed south of the Antarctic Polar Front, except for the squid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> Rochebrune & Mabille, 1889 which has a circumpolar distribution associated to the Polar Frontal Zone. No significant differences in the sizes of P. glacialis preyed upon by elephant seals were found between sexes and years. However, significant interannual differences were found in the taxonomical composition of their diet. This would be associated with temporal changes in food availability at the foraging areas of seals, which in turn may have been influenced by changes in oceanographic conditions as a result of the El Ni&# 241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon that occurred during part of the study period. Furthermore, a differential response of males and females to this temporal variation was observed, with the former being also associated to a predation on octopods. This would suggest a sexual segregation in foraging habits of this species from the early stages of its life cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{diet and}} {{breeding}} performance of Grey-headed Albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma and Black-browed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period between 1996 and 2000. When samples for all years were combined, cephalopods and crustaceans {{were the main}} components in the diet of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. However, their diets exhibited interannual variations. Cephalopods {{were the most important}} component in the diet of Grey-headed Albatrosses between 1996 and 1999 (60 - 75 % by mass) but decreased significantly in 2000 (17 %), when crustaceans dominated (61 %). The Black-browed Albatross diet varied greatly, with cephalopods being the most important component in 1996 (49 % by mass) and 1997 (48 %), fish in 1998 (32 %) and 1999 (40 %), and crustaceans in 2000 (63 %). In 1998 and 2000 there was a significant change in the cephalopod species present in the diet of both albatross species, when their breeding success was low. The consumption of the ommastrephid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> was significantly and positively correlated with Grey-headed Albatross breeding success. For Black-browed Albatrosses significant correlations were found between its consumption of the Icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and breeding success, and between its consumption of M. hyadesi and M. hyadesi CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort). These findings suggest that Grey-headed Albatrosses are more reliant on Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone prey (M. hyadesi and Lamprey Geotria australis) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses are more dependent on Antarctic prey (Icefish and Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba). The differences between diets of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses breeding on different islands of the Southern Ocean showed that Grey-headed Albatrosses feed more on oceanic cephalopods (e. g. M. hyadesi) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses feed primarily on shelf fish (e. g. Blue Whiting Micromesistius australis), suggesting that albatross diets are likely to be influenced by the geographical position of those islands, albatross foraging preference and prey availability...|$|E
40|$|In the Southern Ocean, {{cephalopods}} are infrequently {{captured by}} conventional samplingmethods, {{but this is}} not a reflection of their abundance. This inadequacy has resulted in their being limited knowledge into cephalopods despite their importance as voracious predators and a key prey resource to apex predators. These predators have allowed for a newtechnique to be developed through using theirstomach contents to obtain cephalopods resistant mouthparts (known as beaks). In the Southern Ocean, juvenile elephant sealshavethe greatest divingand foraging capacity, resulting in the greatest representation of the cephalopod community in their stomach contents. These beaks are morphologically uniqueto a species, withthe dimensions related to the size the whole animal, allowing for species specific knowledge that can be relatedto size. Diet, potential prey and distribution can be determined through stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope analysis was conducted ontwo predominate species found in the stomach contents ofjuvenile elephant seals at Macquarie Island. Histioteuthis eltaninae was the most predominate cephalopod species and is believed to have a life span of approximately oneyear. Over this year period, 5 '^C signatures indicated thatthere was no active migration occurring, resulting in all life stages inhabiting thesame broader region. H. eltaninae distribution is relatively confined to waters around Macquarie Island andappears to berestricted bytemperature. The 5 "N value indicated a positively linear relationship between trophic level andsize of the individual. However, as expected in anannual species, this relationship was effected byseason. Despite these relationships, the most predominant prey item appears to correspond withmyctophid fish. <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> was also investigated andappears to have a minimum life span of 16 months indicated bythetwo concurrent size classes occurring between September andDecember. The stable isotope analysis demonstrated a broad distribution that involved extensive migration from southern, almostAntarcticwaters to waters north of Macquarie Island. Thereforethis speeies must withstand a great diversity of temperatures, particularly when compared to H. eltaninae. When eonsidering trophic level andpotential prey resources, there appears to be a shift from one tropic level, such as crustaceans and myctophid fish when individuals were smaller, to largerfish and othercephalopods, approximately the nexttrophic level up in larger individuals.

40|$|The diet of the white-chinned petrel at Bird Island, South Georgia was studied during chickrearing in 1986 by {{quantitative}} analysis (by weight, {{frequency of occurrence}} and number of individuals) of regurgitated or lavaged adult stomach contents. Antarctic krill comprised over 90 % of prey items and formed 47 % of the diet by weight; fish and squid occurred in 67 % and 35 % of samples and formed 33 % and 19 % of the diet by weight, respectively. Decapods, amphipods and salps occurred in a few samples. The fish were mainly lanternfish (Myctophidae) of eight species (chiefly Electrona and Gymnoscopelus, forming 80 % by number and 52 % by mass of fish prey) and the nototheniid Patagonotothen guntheri (14 % by number and 35 % by mass). Of squid taken, the ommastrephid <b>Martialia</b> <b>hyadesi</b> comprised 57 % by number and 52 % by mass and the gonatid Gonatus antarcticus 14 % by number and 42 % by mass. These dietary data confirm white-chinned petrel {{as the most important}} avian consumer of fish and squid at South Georgia (and the third most important consumer of krill). In 1986 the nototheniid fish were probably obtained via commercial fishing operations but the myctophids and squid were probably live-caught, most likely at night. Meal size increased rapidly until chicks were three weeks old and then remained constant until the chicks were within 10 days of fledging, when it decreased. Meal delivery rate was high (one per day) for young chicks (1 – 10 days old) and thereafter fluctuated between 0. 56 and 0. 88 meals per day until close to fledging, when it was halved. These provisioning rates, and the proportion of krill in the diet, are higher than those recorded previously at South Georgia and Indian Ocean sites, probably reflecting high local availability of krill at South Georgia in 1986. In many respects, white-chinned petrels at South Georgia are intermediate ecologically between prions and albatrosses, although specialized in their extensive consumption of myctophids. Because krill and all the main fish prey are currently the targets of substantial commercial fishing and the main squid prey (Martialia) is a potential target, the ecological role and status of white-chinned petrels are of additional importance...|$|E
