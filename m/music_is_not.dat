5|$|The {{reason for}} Szigeti's appeal to composers was {{articulated}} by Bloch {{upon completion of}} his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere {{would have to be}} delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Imogen became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began {{helping with the}} {{organisation}} of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint {{artistic director of the}} festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Imogen's own <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{music is}} {{preserved}} in the set pieces performed at royal and noble weddings and funerals, and in the song sung during the traditional ceremony of apology, the lou-ifi. Radio Tonga begins each day's broadcast with a recording from Honourable Veehala, a nobleman and celebrated virtuoso of the nose flute. This <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> popular music; it is a cherished heirloom, preserved by specialists and taught as needed for special occasions.|$|E

25|$|Buanne {{approached}} several producers {{with the}} idea of recording a collection of romantic Italian songs with an orchestra, which was his real ambition, forged by 5 years of shaping and developing his ideas as an independent artist. The objective behind recording that particular genre was, on one hand, to let people know that “Italian <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just opera or classical”, and on the other hand, to honor his father.|$|E
25|$|According to Danish {{noise and}} music theorist Torben Sangild, one single {{definition}} of noise in <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible. Sangild instead provides three basic definitions of noise: a musical acoustics definition, a second communicative definition based on distortion or disturbance of a communicative signal, {{and a third}} definition based in subjectivity (what is noise to one person can be meaningful to another; what was considered unpleasant sound yesterday is not today).|$|E
25|$|Tamas Wells {{began playing}} the piano when he was aged about eight years, but disliked sitting for the examinations. He grew up {{listening}} to the music of the Beatles – for most of his teenage years the only album he owned was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) – though he says his <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> consciously influenced by them. After finishing school and moving to Melbourne, Australia, for his university education, he had a group of friends who played the guitar and wrote their own music. He also listened to Australian indie bands such as Art of Fighting and The Lucksmiths.|$|E

25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journals Taylor Holliday echoed this: [...] "Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a {{hard time}} because she's a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner's daughter. But as Lucinda or Emmylou might attest, love of the <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good [...] "gal" [...] Morphine, and you know she's as {{mountain}} as they come." ...|$|E
500|$|The inner three {{movements}} {{quote the}} text of the hymn without change, but their <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> related to the hymn tune. The alto aria is accompanied by an obbligato oboe. It is structured in two similar parts, and is in pastoral 6/8 time. The steady flow of the oboe can be seen as depicting the [...] "pure water" [...] mentioned in the text, the steps in the continuo as [...] "the steps made on this significant journey" [...] "on the pathway of the righteousness of His commandments".|$|E

500|$|Robert Christgau thought {{highly of}} the album, however, writing in The Village Voice at the time: [...] "The <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only simple and attractive, with the {{synthesizer}} used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves {{some of the}} symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously." [...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why? It has soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero {{but as long as}} he's Roger's that doesn't matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot for Chicago Tribune {{concluded}} that the song together with [...] "Jump" [...] and [...] "Pour It Up" [...] celebrates [...] "live-for-the-moment hedonism". Smokey Fontaine for The Huffington Post called it a [...] "loud" [...] and [...] "as-curse filled" [...] for it can capture the album's title and reminds the parents that Rihanna's <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet for their kids. Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette criticized the song and called it a [...] "robotic whomp and f-bomb shtick", that rapidly creates [...] "a melody-free, pedestrian turf". Pitchfork Media's Jessica Hopper wrote that [...] "'Phresh Out the Runway' is capitalist braggadocio (nonsense grade) so static it borders on unmusical." [...] Sarah H. Grant of Consequence of Sound called both [...] "Right Now" [...] and [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] "texturally layered", but [...] "lyrically barren".|$|E
500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{infrequent}} performances of Priaulx Rainier's <b>music</b> as they <b>are</b> difficult for both performer and listener.

500|$|The <b>music</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{published}} until 1891 when {{it appeared}} {{as part of the}} first complete edition of the composer´s work, the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. [...] The editor of the volume in question was Alfred Dörffel.|$|R
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the feast}} day {{were from the}} Book of Isaiah, the prophecy of the Messiah (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke the narration of Mary's visit to Elizabeth, which includes her song of praise, the Magnificat (...) [...] This gospel reading is a biblical episode that is often represented in art, especially in music where {{it has become a}} traditional part of Vesper services. In Bach's time, the German Magnificat was regularly sung in Leipzig in vespers in a four-part setting of the ninth psalm tone (tonus peregrinus) by Johann Hermann Schein. Different from the other chorale cantatas of the cycle, the base for text and <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a chorale, but the German Magnificat. It is a canticle, a biblical song in prose concluded by the traditional doxology. The text is based on Luther's translation of the biblical song to German in the Luther Bible, and on the doxology.|$|E
500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers {{to him as}} only [...] "Smokey", which causes Pam to believe {{he is talking about}} Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears". Pam, however, is later able to remember that he sang [...] "Tears of a Clown", and Jim references [...] "I Second That Emotion". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is [...] "not what Smokey would have… does want!" [...] During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> all about [...] "Jason Mraz and The Beatles", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] and [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs.|$|E
500|$|Manhunters soundtrack [...] "dominates the film", {{with music}} that is [...] "explicitly diegetic the entire way". Steve Rybin has commented that the <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{intended}} to correlate with {{the intensity of the}} action portrayed alongside it, but rather to signify when the viewer should react with a [...] "degree of aesthetic distance" [...] from the film, or be [...] "suture into the diegetic world" [...] more closely. The soundtrack album was released in limited quantities in 1986, on MCA Records (#6182). It was not, however, released on compact disc at the time, but only on cassette tape and vinyl record. On 19 March 2007, a two-CD set titled Music from the Films of Michael Mann was released, featuring four tracks from Manhunter: The Prime Movers' [...] "Strong As I Am", Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida", Shriekback's [...] "This Big Hush", and Red 7's [...] "Heartbeat". In March 2010, Intrada Records announced that they were releasing the Manhunter soundtrack on CD for the first time, with an extra track, [...] "Jogger's Stakeout" [...] by The Reds.|$|E

500|$|So Beautiful or So What {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 27 reviews. Many critics compared its diverse influences to Simon's style on his 1986 album Graceland. In a review for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only focused but [...] "vivid, vibrant, and current {{in a way}} none of [...] peers have managed to achieve". Los Angeles Times writer Margaret Wappler praised its [...] "multiethnic landscape" [...] of American folk and Afropop influences on an album that is his best since 1990's Rhythm of the Saints. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles took note of Simon's lyrics: [...] "Sketches of individuals and moments are intertwined with grander pronouncements; unforced humor tempers gloomier reflections". Will Hodgkinson from The Times believed his meditations on the afterlife are informed by both youthful enthusiasm and the wisdom of old age, while The Guardians Maddy Costa said Simon [...] "finds {{an answer to the}} ineffable in song".|$|E
500|$|According to Denis Arnold, {{although}} Monteverdi's late operas retain {{elements of}} the earlier Renaissance intermezzo and pastoral forms, they may be fairly considered as the first modern operas. In the 1960s, however, David Johnson {{found it necessary to}} warn prospective Il ritorno listeners that if they expected to hear opera akin to Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, they would be disappointed: [...] "You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first or second hearing merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence." [...] A few years later, Jeremy Noble in a Gramophone review wrote that Il ritorno was the least known and least performed of Monteverdi's operas, [...] "quite frankly, because its <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so consistently full of character and imagination as that of Orfeo or Poppea." [...] Arnold called the work an [...] "ugly duckling". Later analysts have been more positive; to Mark Ringer Il ritorno is [...] "the most tender and moving of Monteverdi's operas", while in Ellen Rosand's view the composer's ability to portray real human beings through music finds its fullest realisation here, and in Poppea a few years later.|$|E
500|$|Pinker is {{critical}} of theories about the evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In How the Mind Works, Pinker reiterates Immanuel Kant's view [...] that <b>music</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to [...] "auditory cheesecake", stating that [...] "As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless". This argument has been rejected by Daniel Levitin and Joseph Carroll, experts in music cognition, who argue that music has had {{an important role in}} the evolution of human cognition. In his book This Is Your Brain On Music, Levitin argues that music could provide adaptive advantage through sexual selection, social bonding, and cognitive development; he questions the assumption that music is the antecedent to language, as opposed to its progenitor, noting that many species display music-like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music.|$|E
