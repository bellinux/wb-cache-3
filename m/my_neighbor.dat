5|$|In 1987, Studio Ghibli {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki's work on <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director, and Nobuyuki Isshiki was hired as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono was unhappy with {{the differences between the}} book and the screenplay. Miyazaki and Suzuki visited Kadono and invited her to the studio; she allowed the project to continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Kiki's Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989. It earned ¥2.15 billion at the box office, and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki won the Ōfuji Noburō Award at the Mainichi Film Awards for The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), and <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro (1988), and the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film for Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), Princess Mononoke (1997), Spirited Away and Whale Hunt (both 2001). Spirited Away {{was also}} awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and The Wind Rises (2013) {{received}} nominations. He {{was named a}} Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in November 2012, for outstanding cultural contributions. His other accolades include eight Tokyo Anime Awards, eight Kinema Junpo Awards, six Japan Academy Awards, five Annie Awards, and three awards from the Anime Grand Prix and the Venice Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He {{directed}} several {{films with}} Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky in 1986, <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro in 1988, Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989, and Porco Rosso in 1992. The films {{were met with}} commercial and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and considered among the greatest animation films of all time. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, however he returned {{to work on a}} new feature film in 2016.|$|E
50|$|A sequel {{entitled}} Ghoul Patrol {{was released}} in 1994, but was not as well received as its predecessor. Originally, Ghoul Patrol {{was not intended to}} be released as a sequel to Zombies Ate <b>My</b> <b>Neighbors,</b> but was re-worked as such to increase sales. In 1997, LucasArts released a game for Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Sega Saturn titled Herc's Adventures, which uses the same basic gameplay format and mechanics as Zombies Ate <b>My</b> <b>Neighbors,</b> but instead parodies ancient Greek mythology. Day of the Tentacle, another game developed by LucasArts, is referenced in Zombies Ate <b>My</b> <b>Neighbors</b> through a secret level.|$|R

25|$|The show's creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have {{described}} Appa's appearance as {{a cross between}} a buffalo and a manatee.

25|$|The satoyama of Saitama Prefecture {{have been}} {{illustrated}} in anime with great precision and artistic {{attention to detail}} in the very popular film, <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro, by Studio Ghibli, {{under the direction of}} the studio's head and founder, Hayao Miyazaki. The prominence of the satoyama as environment for the story has stirred popular interest in the regions, and encouraged conservation efforts in recent times, in large part thanks to this film. See section Totoro.|$|E
25|$|The manga was {{serialized}} in Tokuma Shoten's monthly Animage magazine between 1982 and 1994. The series initially {{ran from}} the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe. Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed {{for the third time}} from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on Laputa. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films: <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on Porco Rosso. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of Animage. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story {{based on the idea that}} it could be stopped at any moment.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of <b>my</b> <b>neighbor,</b> Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|In June 1985, Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma and Suzuki {{founded the}} {{animation}} production company Studio Ghibli, {{with funding from}} Tokuma Shoten. Studio Ghibli's first film, [...] (1986), employed the same production crew of Nausicaä. Miyazaki's designs for the film's setting were inspired by Greek architecture and [...] "European urbanistic templates". Some of the architecture in the film was also inspired by a Welsh mining town; Miyazaki witnessed the mining strike upon {{his first visit to}} Wales in 1984, and admired the miners' dedication to their work and community. Laputa was released on August 2, 1986. It was the highest-grossing animation film of the year in Japan. Miyazaki's following film, <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro, was released alongside Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies in April 1988 to ensure Studio Ghibli's financial status. The simultaneous production was chaotic for the artists, as they switched between projects. <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro features the theme {{of the relationship between the}} environment and humanity—a contrast to Nausicaä, which emphasises technology's negative effect on nature. The film was commercially unsuccessful at the box office, though merchandising was successful, and it received critical acclaim.|$|E

In Sight & Sound magazine's 2012 poll of the greatest films of all time, WALL-E is the second highest ranking animated film behind <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro (1988), while tying with the film Spirited Away (2001) at 202nd overall. In a 2016 BBC poll of international critics, it was voted the 29th greatest film since 2000.|$|E

500|$|In March 2005, Studio Ghibli {{split from}} Tokuma Shoten. In the 1980s, Miyazaki {{contacted}} Ursula K. Le Guin expressing interest in producing {{an adaptation of}} her Earthsea novels; unaware of Miyazaki's work, Le Guin declined. Upon watching <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro several years later, Le Guin expressed approval {{to the concept of}} the adaptation. She met with Suzuki in August 2005, who wanted Miyazaki's son Gorō to direct the film, as Miyazaki had wished to retire. Disappointed that Miyazaki was not directing, but under the impression that he would supervise his son's work, Le Guin approved of the film's production. Miyazaki later publicly opposed and criticized Gorō's appointment as director. Upon Miyazaki's viewing of the film, he wrote a message for his son: [...] "It was made honestly, so it was good".|$|E
500|$|Every summer, Hayao Miyazaki {{spent his}} {{vacation}} at a mountain cabin {{with his family}} and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films such as <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, which were for small children and teenagers, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like [...] Nakayoshi and Ribon the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes" [...] and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they [...] "held dear in their hearts" [...] and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.|$|E
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] (I eat {{my little}} bit of bread with joy and heartily leave to <b>my</b> <b>neighbor</b> his own.), is dancing and {{accompanied}} by two obbligato parts, oboe and violin. They express in vivid figuration in the violin and a slightly simplified version in the oboe the text [...] "" [...] (a happy spirit, a thankful heart, that gives praise). Hofmann observes that the aria depicts a [...] "pastoral idyll with a rustic musical scene – {{a tribute to the}} Enlightenment utopia of simple, happy country life." [...] The violin's figuration suggests the drone of bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy. The voice leaps in upward sixths, in [...] "folk-like character" [...] and conveying [...] "contented tranquillity". Mincham notes that the first four notes of the oboe ritornello are the first four notes of the closing chorale turned to major.|$|E

500|$|According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's {{style was}} {{influenced}} by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working {{as a writer and}} storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine the series' subversive humor with [...] "beautiful" [...] moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro as inspiration. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are [...] "relaxing" [...] and feature [...] "conversational dialogue that feels natural [...] not over the top [...] cartoony and shrill". Ward described the show as a [...] "dark comedy"; he said [...] "dark comedies are my favorite, because I love that feeling – being happy and scared at the same time. It's my favorite way to feel – when I'm {{on the edge of my}} seat but I'm happy, that sense of conflicting emotions. And there's a lot of that in the show, I think." [...] Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games. Ward intends the show's world to have a certain physical logic instead of [...] "cartoony slapstick"; even though magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world.|$|E
