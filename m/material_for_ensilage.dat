50|$|The crops {{suitable}} <b>for</b> <b>ensilage</b> are {{the ordinary}} grasses, clovers, alfalfa, vetches, oats, rye and maize; various weeds {{may also be}} stored in silos, notably spurrey such as Spergula arvensis. Silage must be made from plant material with a suitable moisture content: about 50% to 60% depending on the means of storage, the degree of compression, {{and the amount of}} water that will be lost in storage, but not exceeding 75%. Weather during harvest need not be as fair and dry as when harvesting for drying. For corn, harvest begins when the whole-plant moisture is at a suitable level, ideally a few days before it is ripe. For pasture-type crops, the grass is mowed and allowed to wilt for a day or so until the moisture content drops to a suitable level. Ideally the crop is mowed when in full flower, and deposited in the silo on the day of its cutting.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to study the ensilage potential of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L,.). The material used in the evaluation was harvested from an experiment in a complete randomized blocks design with three replicates, with seventeen alfalfa cultivars, Criouil, Florida 77, P 555, P 581, Moapa, Gilboa, 34 Linea, C/W 8754, C/W 4468, C/W 86, C/W 8746, Hunter Field, Trifecta, Sequel, CUF 101, Aurora e Siriver, during three years. The harvest used for the determinations was collected at 30 (th) day of plants development and the material was submitted to two treatments: no wilting - Fresh alfalfa frozen immediately after harvest; wilting fresh alfalfa exposed to sun by three hours to get 35 % DM. The dry matter content (DM), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and buffer capacity (BC) were evaluated in rhp forages Wilting increased the dry matter content (39, 98 %), however there were not differences among cultivars.

30|$|In {{tropical}} and subtropical regions, the ensiling process often yields only {{poor quality}} silage. Two {{of the reasons}} are butyric fermentation by butyric acid bacteria and consumption of the nutrients in the silage by coliform bacteria (Tanaka et al. 1994). Butyric acid is usually produced at high temperatures (30 - 50 °C) by butyric acid bacteria, which {{have the ability to}} grow under those conditions. Therefore, to prevent proliferation of butyric acid bacteria and coliform bacteria, silage-making LAB must be capable of rapid growth and high production of lactic acid at high temperatures. Much effort has gone into improving the quality of silage (Weinberg et al. 2007; Lindsey and Kung Jr. 2010; Parvin et al. 2010). In those studies, LABs grown at room temperature showed great ability {{to improve the quality of}} silage. However, it was unclear whether strains showing high lactic acid production could grow ahead of butyric acid bacteria or coliform bacteria at higher temperatures (> 37 °C), which will be necessary for potentially useful candidates to adapt to tropical and subtropical regions. To prepare potential inoculants <b>for</b> <b>ensilage</b> at high temperature, we isolated LABs from silage prepared in southwestern Japan, where the weather can be hot and humid.|$|R

40|$|In Belgium, silage {{constitutes}} the basic cattle forage during winter and, in part, also during summer. There are different crops used <b>for</b> <b>ensilage</b> such as whole corn plant, CCM (corn cob mix), grass, and sugar beet pulp. Among the various clients of BCCM/MUCL, farmers or industries often {{ask for help}} with health problems encountered in livestock fed with fungal and presumably mycotoxin contaminated silage. However, little information is are available {{that could be used}} to assess the risks of such contaminations by fungal toxic secondary metabolites, largely because most of the suspected effects are non-specific (reduction of fertility, reduction of productivity, immunosuppressive effects, etc.) and subject to influences other than simply feed quality. However, the presence of molds is a good indication of the likelihood of mycotoxin problems. Several mycotoxin-producing genera such as Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys have often been isolated from silage samples. Those genera are perfectly adapted to silage conditions and can be correlated with the presence of mycotoxins. In addition, fusarial toxins (toxins produced by various species of Fusarium) have been detected in significant quantities in silage samples, although the living conditions for Fusaria are not optimum in such matrices. Therefore, the presence of the mycotoxins could be accounted for by fungal production while the plants were growing. In that context, BCCM/MUCL introduced two research projects in order to analyze both silage and plants at the fungal and the mycotoxigenic levels...|$|R
