40|$|The present article {{deals with}} Italy's housing crises after the Second World War {{and in the}} 1960 s, which signalled {{the onset of the}} Italian "economic miracle. " In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, the crisis amounted to a housing shortage caused by wartime destruction and social stagnation in the fascist period, demographic growth and a considerable rural exodus. The situation gradually evolved into a social crisis shaped by economic choices, as liberalism was heightened in the construction sector by state subsidies. Construction was effectively targeted at the middle class, so that working class residents were de facto segregated in substandard dwellings known under various designations. Opening with a summary of the many dimensions of the housing problem, the paper explores "crisis spaces," deprived areas and segregation processes, by focusing on three archetypal case studies: <b>Matera's</b> rural districts and Sassi, Rome's Borgate and Milan's Corre. The article finally tackles urban struggles and the roleplayed by housing issues in the emergence of protest movements from 1968 onwards, as allegations of misappropriation of public funds against the administration began to hit the headlines.

The {{sponsors}} were Captain Louise Roach, Major Hazel Nelson and Captain Euva Sitton.Company K. Won first place for two years, and the trophy was given to Diamond Hill to place permanently in the trophy case.In 1930 the girls' basketball team won the city championship for Diamond Hill.Diamond Hill also won first place in Class A relays at the annual track meet in 1930. In the fall of 1930 the high school was removed from Diamond Hill. The school was then classified as a junior high school. Senior high school students who lived on Diamond Hill went to North Side High School.Mr. Roach was retained as principal of Diamond Hill, and he soon had the school running smoothly again.In 1932 at the city R.O.T.C. drill, Winifred Fitzgerald won first place for Diamond Hill School in individual competition.Ex-students of Diamond Hill held their first homecoming on October 21, 1932. The first meeting was suggested and arranged by Ray Finney who acted as chairman at the first meeting. Mr. A.B. Jolly was the first president elected.In the fall of 1933 the high school was returned to Diamond Hill. Mr. J.G. Wittmayer was made principal, and Miss Julia Christmas was made vice-principal. The principal, vice-principal, and the entire student body along with citizens of the community became deeply interested in the organization of a high school that would be a credit to Fort Worth, and they worked hard to make it such. The curriculum was revised and expanded and many new activities heretofore not included in the school were introduced. In October that year Mr. R.W. Nation sponsored the organization of a Hi- Club in the high school. The Hi-Y Club is a division of the Young Men’s Christian Association of the city. Dwight Johnston was the first president elected and Wilford Matlock served as vice-president for the first term. The club met once a week and was quite an active organization.During the few years that the school was rated as a junior high school there was no Girls' Glee Club in the school. One of the first of the new activities inaugurated when the new high school year began was a Girls' Glee Club. It was organized and directed by Miss Philo Mae Murphree. The group developed rapidly and was presented in recital during the following Christmas season. It was {{one of the largest and}} most active groups in the school that year. Interest in girls' athletics was aroused and kept alive by the organization of a girls' athletic association in the latter part of September in 1933. Club members consisted of all girls who were interested in any or all kinds of sports. Stella Kuba was the first president of the club. The first year of the club was quite successful. The girls entered several sports contests in the city and won the city championship in basketball. The physical training teacher was sponsor of the association. A high school art department was launched for the first time at the beginning of the second semester in 1934. Mrs. R.D. Wise was head of the department. There were several classes in the division and each class was full. Art students became deeply interested in their work and many posters were made by them to advertise school activities. That year in February Diamond Hill High School was represented for the first time in the annual high school art exhibit at Carnegie Library. The organization of a school orchestra was begun in the spring of 1934 when Mrs. Bessie N. Neal was assigned to the task. Mrs. Neal was handicapped because the intermediate building was being remodeled and the orchestra students had no definite place to meet. Meeting alternately in the auditorium, dressing rooms, back stage, and in various class rooms, the new group soon mastered their instruments well enough to present a program in assembly six weeks after it was first organized. Before school closed that year a regular music room was prepared for the orchestra and high school music classes on the first floor of the intermediate building. A piano, twenty-five new chairs, and six music stands were added to the room. Twenty members made up the advanced orchestra that year and there were seventeen pupils in the beginners orchestra. In 1934 the Diamond Hill Eagles captured the City Class B championship in basketball without the loss of a struggle. Members of the team were: Leon Atherton, Weldon Jordon, Dwight Johnston, Alton Jones, Wilford Matlock, Purvis Wilcox, and Bob Boydston.Another triumph in sports came that same year when the Diamond Hill boys' baseball team won the city class B Championship. Mr. Cooper Robbins was coach, Mr. R.W. Nation, business manager, and Ward Boydstun was water jack. Boys on the team were: Nolan Herndon, Leon Atherton, Winifred Fitzgerald, Henry English, Wilford Matlock, Dwight Johnston, J.W. Key, Edgar Rabun, and Alton Jones. One of the most appreciated of the remodeling projects in the high school building in 1933 was the work done in the science laboratory. All the old tables and equipment were replaced by new modern laboratory tables and new equipment. Through the efforts of Mr. Travis Hugh Small, the chemistry teacher, the chemical supplies increased and by his supervision the laboratory was kept in good order and was recognized in 1935 as the most well-kept and cleanest laboratory in the city. In 1934 the Diamond Hill School grounds were selected as a Public Works Administration project. Their job was to widen and landscape the school grounds. A landscape artist along with Mr. Wittmayer and Miss Chrisman made plans for the widening and beautification of the school grounds.All the rocks were removed from the grounds. Behind the school houses a large playground was made. In front of the school the grounds were landscaped. Grass shrubbery, and trees were planted while flagstone paths were laid. The cost was $30,000 but was worth far more than that to the pupils and citizens of Diamond Hill. In1934 the football season was entered into with full enthusiasm, proved to be quite successful. The team tied for the city Class B championship. Eagles on the team that year were: Dwight Johnston, Bobbie Boydstun, Wilford Matlock, David Heard, Edgar Rabun, Leon Atherton, Cletis Evans, John Earl Harvey, J.W. Key, Weldon Jordon, and Winifred Fitzgerald.That fall a boys’ glee club was organized. The club developed rapidly and the boys were presented in several assembly programs at their own school and other schools. In January 1935 Diamond Hill High School was represented for the first time in the one-act play contest in the Interscholastic League tournament. The name of the play entered was [...] "Submerged" [...] and was awarded second place. Individual honor went to Edgar Rabun of Diamond Hill. Other members of the cast were: John Earl Harvey, Henry English, Wilford Matlock, Floyd Hungerford, Welden Jordon, Mrs. Floy J. Moore, directed the play.The school was also represented that year in the first annual high school play tournament sponsored by the speech department of Texas Woman’s College. Each school presented the same play, [...] "Not Quite Such a Goose". Members of the cast were: Edgar Rabun, Bernice Morton, Dora Ruth Terry, and Dorothy Joe Washan. The first graduating class after the restoration of the high school held their exercises in the school auditorium in February 1935. Most of the graduates finished their school work the year before but waited until the next year to get their diplomas. There were ten members in the first class including: Stella Kuba, Lois Jaynes, Ruby Biggerstaff, Leo Bullard, Ruby Nell Gresham, David Heard, Meta Huggins, Ida Mae McCullough, Freida Pannill, and Ed Skillern.Again in 1935 the Diamond Hill High School cagers were victors. The team captured the city class B basketball championship for the second time in two years. In the spring of 1935 Diamond Hill High School accepted the Mary Hardin Baylor invitation to their annual play days which were held May 3 and 4. School girls from all over the state were there. A delegation of girls and sponsors including Sue Ella McCarty, Bernice Morton, Leona Hale, Mary Etta Bowers, Willore Galaway, Carrie Mae Haynes, Dorothy Joe Washam, Miss Philo Mae Murphree, Miss Julia Christan, and Mrs. BessieKinney went from Diamond Hill. For the second year the baseball team won city class B Championship.In 1935 Miss Philo Mae Murphree, faculty member wrote the words and selected a tune for the Alma Mater of Diamond Hill High School. There are no words which would make a more appropriate ending of the history of the school than those of the Alma <b>Mater.As</b> long as we liveFondest memories will lingerTo bring back the school daysWe spent on the hill.We’ll bless as we travelThe road to achievementThe friends we madeThe plans we laidAt Diamond Hill.|$|R
