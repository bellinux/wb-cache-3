5|$|The {{games were}} {{the first in the}} series that did not contain all of the Pokémon from {{previous}} generations. Sugimori stated that the team tried to include all the new Pokémon as well as some from previous generations. When asked about any features that could not be included due to technical restrictions, Masuda noted that he wanted each individual Pokémon to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three different cries depending on its mood.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|In deep seawaters the isotope 230Th <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 0.04% {{of natural}} thorium. This is because its parent 238U is soluble in water, but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which {{over a quarter}} is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to his joining New York City FC, Villa was {{announced}} to {{have joined the}} Australian A-League with Melbourne City, following the team's association with Manchester City. Villa was on a guest stint, allowing him to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ten appearances for Melbourne City during the 2014–15 season, {{taking advantage of the}} scheduling of the A-League and MLS to maintain match fitness ahead of his debut with New York City. After only joining Melbourne City for pre-season training just over a week before their first game, Villa was brought on in the 48th minute of {{the first game of the}} season against Sydney FC, and scored a debut goal a quarter of an hour into his appearance. On 19 October 2014, in his second match, Villa scored an 87th-minute equaliser against the Newcastle Jets for a 11 draw.|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began on}} Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the {{direction}} of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.|$|E
5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E
