40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} {{simultaneous}} <b>MAC</b> <b>packet</b> transmission over a wireless system using the CDMA technology can be improved. The main idea behind our approach is, that in opposite to common wireless CDMA systems, where each mobile station has one code for all connections, we supply the mobile with multiple codes for a single connection. This opens the possibility to transmit multiple packets in parallel, each packet with a different code. The motivation for using multiple codes for each connection is to stabilise the quality of service (QoS). We give a first impression how our approach improves TCP throughput with simultaneous <b>MAC</b> <b>packet</b> transmission. 1 Introduction On the assumption {{that we have the}} possibility within a mobile communication system to allocate more than one CDMA channel for one communication session, we want to show the improvements that can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract — Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{transmission}} is an emerging wireless technology, and {{medium access control}} (MAC) with quality of service (QoS) provisioning is essential to coordinate the access among competing devices in UWB-based wireless networks. In this paper, we study the exclusive region concept (which was previously proposed) to determine the active set of senders at a time. We find out that, different from the previous work, the exclusive region for a specific link should be a systemlevel concept, and should depend on system factors such as interference from/to other active links. Based on the findings, two <b>MAC</b> <b>packet</b> scheduling schemes are proposed to exploit the system capacity and, at the same time, to achieve {{a certain level of}} fairness in UWB wireless networks. As the long acquisition time in UWB transmission can significantly reduce the system efficiency, the proposed schemes can be modified to alleviate the negative effect of a long acquisition time. Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed schemes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecture for a wireless IP (Internet Protocol) network. In {{order to support}} IP-based multimedia services in a wireless network, two different approaches can be used. One approach is to transmit end-to-end IP packets in a multi-hop network, such as a cellular mobile telephone network. In this case IP packets can be transmitted on high data rate air interfaces using a suitable IP header compression technique. Another possibility is to transmit non-IP packets from a UE to a BTS using standard 2 G/ 3 G air interfaces. IP packets can be generated at a BTS by encapsulating received <b>MAC</b> <b>packets</b> on an uplink. On a downlink, an IP packet received from a RAN is fragmented at a BTS for further transmission using a standard air interface. This paper first reviews the end-to-end IP packet transmission strategy based on IP header compression techniques. Next a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecturefor a wireless IP network is proposed. The proposed protocol architecture is suitable for generating IP packets at a BTS by encapsulating <b>MAC</b> <b>packets.</b> IP packet encapsulation delay at a BTS is minimized by using a reservation-based MAC protocol. The MAC protocol uses class-based reservation and priority queuing techniques to satisfy QoS needs of different classes of traffic. The RLC protocol is mapped onto the MAC protocol to minimize signaling overhead. The proposed RLC/MAC layer is simple, flexible, and generates minimum signaling load to maintain high QoS for multimedia traffic.

This consumption depends on the ratio of duration of transceiver in RX mode/duration of transceiver in IDLE mode.
