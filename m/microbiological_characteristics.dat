The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

Os materiais consistiram de cinco amostras, sendo uma de farinha de mandioca sem mistura (simples) e as demais de farinhas de mandioca temperadas. A farinha simples foi embalada em sacos de polietileno de baixa densidade com capacidade de 1, 0 kg e as farinhas temperadas foram embaladas em sacos plásticos de polipropileno pigmentado, com capacidade 0, 5 kg. Em todas as amostras, foram realizadas contagens de coliformes fecais, Staphylococcus aureus, bactérias mesófilas, bolores e leveduras e pesquisa de Salmonella sp. As análises foram realizadas em intervalos de 30 dias. Não foram detectadas diferenças entre as características microbiológicas das amostras simples e das temperadas. O armazenamento não alterou os padrões microbiológicos das amostras. As amostras apresentaram esterilidade para coliformes fecais, Salmonella sp. e Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|Abstract: The {{chemical}} <b>characteristics</b> and <b>microbiological</b> {{examination of}} vacuum packaged ground buffalo meat during cold storage for 24 days were determined {{in order to}} evaluate two different antimicrobial agents sodium lactate, sodium chloride and their mixture. The {{results indicated that the}} use of sodium lactate with or without sodium chloride delayed the proliferation of aerobic plate count, psychrotrophic count, and lactic acid bacterial count, and extended the shelf life up to more than 24 and 21 days respectively, compared to 8 days for the control samples. The TBA values for the samples treated by sodium chloride was not affected, while at the end of storage period the TBA values of samples treated by sodium lactate were significantly reduce the oxidation changes. Therefore, the use of sodium lactate with or without sodium chloride could be used to extend the shelf life of ground buffalo meat during refrigerated storage by reducing both chemical and microbiological changes.

40|$|Preservation or {{improvement}} of soil quality and productivity is of major importance for sustainable agriculture. Microorganisms strongly influence these soil characteristics {{as they are}} involved in nutrient cycling, transformation processes and soil aggregate formation, as well as in plant pathology or plant growth promotion. A profound understanding of structure, dynamics and functions of soil microbial populations represents one key to the understanding and description of soil quality. Therefore, we analyzed longterm effects of three farmyard manure (FYM) -based farming systems, i. e. bio-dynamic (BIODYN), bio-organic (BIOORG) and conventional (CONFYM), on <b>microbiological</b> soil <b>characteristics</b> and compared them to long-term effects of minerally fertilized (CONMIN) and unfertilized (NOFERT) control systems. Furthermore, we compared these long-term effects of farming systems to short-term effects of the crops winter wheat and grass-clover ley. The DOK field experiment in Therwil, Switzerland, which was established in 1978, represents in a unique long-term comparison, allowing to approach these questions. Effects on <b>microbiological</b> soil <b>characteristics</b> were assessed with a polyphasic approach by analyzing soil microbial biomass, soil DNA content, colony forming unit (CFU) counts, community level substrate utilization (CLSU) patterns with BiologTM EcoPlates, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP profiles of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. The soil biomass parameters, i. e. microbial biomass, DNA content and CFU, were all strongly influenced by the farming systems, whereas only CFUs were significantly affected by the two crops analyzed. Differences among the FYM-based farming systems BIODYN, BIOORG and CONFYM were only significant for microbial biomass and DNA content. CLSU and T-RFLP profiling, on the other hand, allowed for consistent differentiation of soil bacterial community structure in relation to the influence of farming systems and crops. The analyses revealed that the main and highly significant effect on <b>microbiological</b> soil <b>characteristics</b> was related to FYM applications. Less strong but significant effects were caused by the two crops, i. e. winter wheat and grass-clover. Effects of the farming systems BIODYN, BIOORG and CONFYM on soil bacterial community structure were relatively weak and not significant. These results suggest that for successful soil quality management fertilization regime and crop rotation are of major importance and that polyphasic approaches are needed to describe and assess <b>microbiological</b> soil <b>characteristics.</b> 2005 Elsevier B.

In production of urutan, two strains of lactic acidbacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus plantarum U 201 and Pediococcus acidilactici U 318, were used asmultiple starter culture.

The additionof 1 - 2 % turmeric suppressed the growth of Enterobacteriaceae to undetected level after 48 hfermentation. The growth of Staphylococcus aureus tended to decrease during fermentation, andthese bacteria were not detected on urutan which used turmeric of 1 - 2 % after 96 h fermentation. At the initial of fermentation the growth of micrococci increased, and the bacteria decreasedgradually from 48 h fermentation until the end of fermentation.

Effectivity of treatments was assessed by addition of inoculants (control, Lp, Lp+Sc) and level of rice bran (0, 5 and 10 %) which were arranged on Completely Randomized Design with Teatments Factors (3 x 3). The variables measured were total colonies of microbes (lactic acid bacteria, yeast and clostridia), total gas production, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH 3). Results showed that clostridial colonies counted on silage treated by Lp and Lp+Sc around 37. 5 % and 68. 7 % in which lower than control. Addition of inoculants and rice bran increased fermentability of silage significantly (P 0. 05) on production of VFA and NH 3.

Samples were analyzed using culturing techniques. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association of disease status and various patient- and implant-related factors (gender, patient age, smoking, number of remaining teeth, percentage of teeth with bone loss, implant function time, implant surface and presence of plaque) with <b>microbiological</b> <b>characteristics.</b> RESULTS: Peri-implant disease status was significantly associated with the submucosal presence of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythia, and F. nucleatum.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of all patients with contact lens induced corneal ulcers admitted to the teaching hospitals of Babol, Iran, from 2011 - 2013. An ophthalmologist examined patients with the slit-lamp and clinical features of them were noted (including pain, redness, foreign body sensation, chemosis, epiphora, blurred vision, discomfort, photophobia, discharge, ocular redness and swelling). All suspected infectious corneal ulcers were scraped for microbial culture and two slides were prepared. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 18. 0. Results: A total of 14 patients (17 eyes) were recruited into the study (100 % female). The patients’ age ranged from 16 - 37 years old (mean age 21. 58 ± 7. 23 years). The most prevalent observed clinical signs were pain and redness. Three samples reported as sterile. The most common isolated causative organism was pseudomonas aeroginosa (78. 6 %), Staphylococcus aureus 14. 3 %, and enterobacter 7. 1 %, respectively. Treatment outcome was excellent in 23. 5 %, good in 47. 1 %, and poor in 29. 4 % of cases. Conclusion: Improper lens wear and care as well as the lack of awareness about the importance of aftercare visits have been identified as potential risk factors for the corneal ulcer among contact lens wearers. Training and increasing the awareness of adequate lens care and disinfection practices, consulting with an ophthalmologist, and frequent replacement of contact lens storage cases would greatly help reducing the risk of microbial keratitis. </p...|$|R
