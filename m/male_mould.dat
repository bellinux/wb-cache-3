50|$|A {{graphite}} coated blank {{is clamped}} over a 'tray' containing a heated <b>male</b> <b>mould.</b> Air pressure forces the metal into {{close contact with}} the mould. The difference between this and the female forming process is that the mould is, as stated, male and the metal is forced over the protruding form. For the female forming the mould is female and the metal is forced into the cavity.The tooling consists of two pressure Chambers and a counter punch, which is linearly displaceable. Similar to the cavity forming technology, at the process beginning, the firmly clamped blank is bulged by gas pressure.|$|E
50|$|Steel, wood, GRP, {{and other}} {{materials}} are used as mould materials for prototyping purposes. The mould can be a male or female mould. To make shower bathtubs, a <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> is used. In the boating industry, a single-sided female mould made from FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic) is used to make yacht hulls. The outer shell of the mould is stiffened by a wood frame. The mould is made by taking the reversal of a male pattern. Several different hull sizes can be made using the same mould. The length of the mould is shortened or lengthened using inserts and mould secondaries such as windows, air vents, and propeller shaft tunnels.|$|E
50|$|A {{graphite}} coated blank {{is placed}} into a heated press. Air pressure {{is used to}} force the metal into a bubble shape before the male mold is pushed into {{the underside of the}} bubble to make an initial impression. Air pressure is then used from the other direction to final form the metal around the <b>male</b> <b>mould.</b> This process has long cycle times because the superplastic strain rates are low. Product also suffers from poor creep performance due to the small grain sizes and there can be cavitation porosity in some alloys. Surface texture is generally good however. With dedicated tooling, dies and machines are costly. The main advantage of the process is that {{it can be used to}} produce large complex components in one operation. This can be useful for keeping the mass down and avoiding the need for assembly work, a particular advantage for aerospace products. For example, the diaphragm-forming method (DFM) can be used to reduce the tensile flow stress generated in a specific alloy matrix composite during deformation.|$|E

The height is 7.0 meters tall {{that is capable of}} holding a combined crew weight of 155 kg to 165 kg. It contains three sets of shrouds that connect to a fitting {{on the side of the}} boat. The crew is able to adjust them by tightening or loosening them, depending on the wind speed and sea states.|$|R
50|$|Microthermoforming is the {{abbreviation}} for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have {{structures in the}} micrometre range and have their technical function provided by {{the shape of the}} microstructure 1. Thermoforming 2 in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over <b>male</b> <b>moulds</b> (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.|$|R

5000|$|The hot {{moulding}} process was an adaptation to post war boat {{building of the}} method originally developed by de Havillands in the 1930s for [...] "stressed skin" [...] wooden aircraft production, using layers of thin birch plywood sandwiched together with glue over a <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> and [...] "cooked" [...] in a large oven called an “autoclave” By using true mass-production techniques, Fairey Marine were able to turn out vast numbers of identical boats at an unprecedented quality and price.Moulds were constructed from spruce, built up on a steel base plate. Seven by three inches planks cut to the waterplane sections provided the starting point. Working from the sheerline, the planks were built up {{in a series of}} steps, arriving quickly at a close representation of the designed shape. Subsequent fairing yielded finished dimensions. Rebates for the keel, stem and transom completed the mould building process.Although the veneers used to produce Fairey boats may appear to be parallel sided, every one was in fact profiled. Rather than shaping each veneer to fit on the mould, as in traditional boat building, Faireys saved an enormous amount of time by sawing complete sets of veneers to precision patterns. Veneers were produced in stacks of six. Boat were then typically built in batches of 24 or 36. Early boats used 1/8″ spruce ply, surplus to the War Department’s de Havilland Mosquito aircraft programme. When this material became unavailable it was replaced by 2.5 mm agba veneers.|$|E
30|$|The {{pattern for}} the {{microfluidic}} device was designed using AutoCAD and was produced on a high-resolution plotted film. This film was bonded to a customized quartz glass, {{resulting in a}} compositional photomask. The negative photoresist SU- 8 2075 was spin-coated onto a 4 -inch silicon wafer. A mask aligner was subsequently used for photoetching {{and led to a}} <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> in the silicon wafer. PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pre-polymer and curing agent were mixed at a ratio of 10 : 1 and rapidly stirred. The PDMS mixture was poured onto the silicon master, degassed in a vacuum oven, and then cured at 65  °C overnight. After curing, the PDMS replica containing the microchannel pattern was peeled away from the silicon master. A hole puncher was used to create holes in a set position to form inlets and outlets for the samples and reagents. The PDMS replica and glass slides were exposed to an oxygen plasma (Harrick Plasma, USA) for 180  s at 300  W and were then face–face bonded.|$|E
40|$|Filament winding {{products}} {{are widely used}} due to their quality, high strength {{and a series of}} advantages in the industrial areas. The process involves winding filaments under varying amounts of tension over a <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> or mandrel. The tension control product has become the most important object in the process. This study describes the tension force control of filament winding with fuzzy neural network controller design and its application to fiber reinforced plastics. The controller produces the error of the closed loop control system response and the actual system output for the desired tension system, instead of ordinary PID adjustment mechanism. Dynamic performance analysis of a traditional PID controller and fuzzy neural network controller is performed in detail using simulation and experiments. The results show that the system can not only exhibit desired dynamic performance but can also adapt to the wide range of speed and tension force changes by a proper servo motor and winding operation. This study provides the primary theoretical guide for the configuration design, optimization and control research of the FNN applications to industrial winding process...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine woman as reader and writer in early sixteenth-century France. As a focal point to the study, I {{concentrate}} {{on the theme of}} speech. The exclusion of the Renaissance woman from mixed-sex conversations allows us to perceive her writing as a form of vicarious speech. The thesis is divided into two distinct parts. Part 1 (Chapters 1 - 3) deals with various images and stereotypes of the female sex, which feature in texts by male writers. Chapter 1 discusses the behavioural models set out in etiquette books, while emphasizing the differing ideals for each of the sexes. A comparison of these role models shows that all aspects of the ideal for the female sex, revolving around a central concern with chastity, seek to curb feminine behaviour. Chapter 2 explores the notion of male writing as a public dialogue in which woman frequently becomes the subject of scurrilous debate. In works such as the Blasons Anatomiques and the French emblems, the <b>male</b> poet-cum-artisan <b>moulds</b> and sculpts his ideal image of woman, transforming her into a voiceless artefact. The attitude of these writers towards women tends to be aggressive, or even overtly sadistic. My third chapter is devoted to the examination of literary representations of the sixteenth-century wife. In Chapters 1 - 3, emphasis is placed on woman's position as the forgotten or ignored listener, her presence needed only for a silent appreciation of male rhetoric. Part 2 (Chapters 4 - 5) concentrates on texts composed by women, grouping works into the categories of secular, and then devotional writings. The aim of these chapters is to rediscover writers whose works have been obscured by time. Consequently, many of the texts studied have never been previously analysed in such detail, or examined from a literary perspective. By recreating a chain of women writers, we may establish the continuity of a female tradition in the Renaissance period. Certain stylistic and thematic characteristics recur in the works of all women writers. In my analysis of feminine writing, these similarities are attributed to the social constraints shared by all women attempting to assert a voice in a male-dominated discourse...|$|R
40|$|Only men can {{initiate}} boys into men. Boys {{are prepared}} into men by men of integrity, for that reason, when a father is absent a male model {{has to be}} found. Lack of models {{is the number one}} enemy for our adolescent males in Zimbabwe today. The absence of adult role models means adolescent <b>males</b> are <b>moulded</b> by unsupervised, doubtful and inexperienced peers. In the past the bringing up of a child was a community responsibility. In the present day children are growing up as sheep without a male shepherd. The qualitative and quantitative research methods guided the process of this study. The study revealed that fathers are absent because they have migrated to other countries and that their absence has a negative impact on developing healthy adolescent males. Migration of fathers to the Diaspora could not be resisted by men because of the socioeconomic and political situation in Zimbabwe. Fathers have left the country for greener pastures. The exodus of fathers to the Diaspora has created a vacuum when it comes to mentoring and <b>moulding</b> of <b>male</b> children into adults. The study carried out with adolescent boys indicated that fathers in the Diaspora are engaged in some form of income generating activities. As a result, some of these men are able to provide material needs intended for their families back home. However, the absence of these fathers has made some children feel emotionally abandoned and betrayed, while others are disappointed by fathers who did not bid them farewell at the time they were living the country. There is another group that felt that the absence benefited them. The absence of fathers destroyed father – son relationships, generated anger, bitterness and lack of any future trust with fathers. When children are angered and bitterness resides in them, they would go against their father’s potential assistance. On the other hand, in the process of the study on the absent father, a Christian model of caring for an individual and community emerged. The church has been noted to be the only institution that would guide the society to value the job of caring for the people of God who are in needy situations. When the church cares for the adolescents it will be caring for itself as well as the body of Christ. The author considered the views from James fowler (1981) and Gerkin (1997) on the stages of faith development and the idea of seeing the church as a community of faith in order for this research to portray the community of faith as a Community of Love. This is because it is only by Christ’s love that people are forgiven by God through grace. In addition, it is through love that people are nurtured; miracles of spiritual and numerical growth are realised. Acts 2; bears witness of the power in love fellowships or communities. He states that in sharing the gospel of Christ in love fellowships each member becomes a part of Christ’s body that spreads the gospel. The love fellowships make the church {{to be more than a}} preaching or meeting point. It becomes a family where all members have the opportunity to share their experiences at fellowship and individual levels. People will not depend on one person for spiritual growth but on each other for spiritual nourishment. Gerkin was important throughout the research with his pastoral care approach of caring for an individual and the communities of a Christian story in addition to guiding the researcher to create a model for a caring community. Therefore, caring of boys whose fathers are absent requires both individual mentors and local communities to model them. The church has been found wanting by the boys in this study. Boys have indicated that the church was not aware of their pain. This shows that the church was unable to see the depressed and hear the silent voices in order to interpret their situation. This reveals that the church has some parts that need spiritual attention in order for the body of Christ to function optimally. Children will open their hearts in love fellowships in order to be healed, nurtured, sustained and guided through love. Faith will be expressed in a more mature and responsible way when all is done in love. Faith in this study is the act of love that guides individuals and communities to an expression of freedom and responsibility in trusting God’s presence in human situations. It aims at increasing love for one another and to God. For it is only through Christ’s love that healthy memories are created. Chapter one gives the background and context of the problem to the study. It reveals that the motivation to carry out the study emerged from the author’s journey with his father and interactions with young people as a youth pastor. Therefore the socio-economic and political situation in Zimbabwe created an environment for the study to be carried out. In addition, absences of mothers at church prompted him to consider carrying out a study on the: Absent fathers due to migrant work: Its traumatic impact on adolescent males in Zimbabwe. Many women went to collect money from their husbands who are in the Diaspora each month end. Chapters twodemonstrates how a qualitative and quantitative method of carrying of the research is helpful. Listening to stories of the adolescent males enriched the research process. Chapter three dealt with the stages of human development coined by Erik Erikson with the intention to give the reader an understanding regarding the worth of adolescence stage. Chapter four explains father and fatherhood, the role of a father and impact of absence towards the up bringing of adolescent male children. Adolescent males develop their masculinity from their fathers for this reason every child should have a male model in order for him to be a man. In chapter five the researcher engaged in dialogue with adolescent males. Chapter six gave the concluding thoughts and recommendations to the study. The church has been identified as central in guiding children at individual and group levels in this era. The church should be a component of the extended family that is unique but related to the family units without competing with it. Every son needs a biological father from whom he learns how to manage weakness and strengths in his life and act in response to the challenges of the global village. Therefore, a father ought to be a male person in Zimbabwe who fears God and loves his sons not an angel out of this planet. Finally every adolescent child needs Christian males to guide him for it is through Christ’s love that healthy male memories are created. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

The important thing was to pre-heat the mould before spraying, build the tray in layers, where spraying should be carried out in a 45 ° angle, with single sweeps while rotating the mould in the beginning of the process, and to use a drying method, were the drying could be focused on the wet parts at the same time as it could avoid those who already had been dried, to dry the sample between each layer of MFC until the wet surface disappeared. Exactly how many sweeps per layer that should be sprayed after the first drying does not matter much, the important thing was that the layers do not become too thick. Because then, too much moisture was trapped inside the samples which made them burst during the drying...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{important}} work of women’s rights and feminist groups since the 1980 s, actors of refugee protection are now {{aware that the}} international refugee protection framework is not gender neutral. Refugees who did not fit the heterosexual <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> installed by the 1951 Refugee Convention had difficulties not only accessing refugee status, but also support services when in exile. Today, both {{at the international level}} and in the UK, non-state actors use the concept of gender to highlight the differences in access to support for different groups of refugees, such as women and more recently, LGBTI people. Despite the ubiquity of the concept of gender in the refugee support field, its meaning today remains unclear. In this research project, I looked at the place of gender in refugee support services in the UK through the work of a local organisation that supports asylum seekers and refugees in the North of England. I sought to address the following questions: is gender taken into account in the charity’s services (and how) ? Does gender {{have an impact on the}} clients’ access to support and the quality of the services given? Inspired by feminist and postcolonial thought, I focused the thesis on the experiences and views of the clients who receive services and the staff and volunteers who provide them. I analysed data from semi-structured interviews with twenty-one participants and from participant observation. The project revealed that in a context where equality is an obligation for charities, talking about (in) equality, identity and difference seems to have become more difficult. However, the analysis of participants’ accounts and discourses showed that a conversation about those themes – ‘about gender’ – remains important and necessary...|$|E
40|$|The boat {{has to be}} {{design for}} in and {{offshore}} races in the Adriatic Sea; the length is been chosen based on the local regulations and for a compromise between light and strong wind characteristics. A canting keel system will be developed to increase the stability in strong winds conditions keeping the displacement not very high. For {{the use of the}} canting keel system a front dagger board is necessary to increase the side force of the boat; to maximize the boat performances is been decide to use two asymmetric dagger boards, fore the mast, one in each side. The study of their Lift and Drag coefficient is been taking into account to optimize their performances; various NACA profile has been take in consideration. The boat is design as fully racing boat so all the criteria are focalized for its functionality, maneuvers and simplicity of the deck lay out; a large open cockpit is required for an easy crew disposition during maneuvers. A height of 1. 85 m is required in the inside of the coach roof for an easier crew liability and to keep a good relationship between the length of the boat and its height. To make the boat faster in light-wind conditions, high SA/Δ and SA/WSA ratios have to be reach. The mast design will focus on the performances in light wind conditions with the forestay height on 9 / 10 of the mast length with the possibility to use a masthead asymmetrical spinnaker and a “code-zero”. Two runners and backstay for each sides and shrouds with few degrees angle of sweptback spreader will support the mast.

40|$|The Caribbean is an {{archipelago}} {{that lies}} between the southern United States {{and the northern}} end of South America, dispersed with many closely spaced island nations. At the base of the archipelago sits the country of Trinidad and Tobago, the industrial hub of the Caribbean with an economy fueled by the oil and gas industries. With this Trinidad has the capability to support yacht construction, and both yacht and ship repair. With the current low in the global economy and with yachts being sold to Caribbean customers from the United States cheaply, it was undertaken to design a comfortable weekender powerboat for the local market to be produced in Trinidad. The design intent is that of a fast comfortable motor cruiser with the ability to host 4 guests in separate double cabins for a long weekend cruise throughout the Caribbean. The vessel style is to be {{similar to that of the}} Down East style lobster boats from Maine, USA. The vessel is to be easily constructed using simple production methods appropriate to the labor skill and industrial resources available at hand in the country. A comparison between different production technologies is undertaken in this study and the pros and cons of each weighed up aiding in the final decision. Material choice was governed as much by the structural requirements of the vessel as it was by the proposed production method and the working environment. Boat builders were asked about general fiberglass boat construction; their opinions and practical knowledge in reinforcement laying up techniques and issues were taken into consideration for the laminate schedule of the vessel also. Different mould tools are identified within this study from mass production female mould tools, temporary female mould tools and finally <b>male</b> <b>mould</b> tools.
